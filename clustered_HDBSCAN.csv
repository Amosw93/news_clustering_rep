2024-02-01,Norway hit by worst storm in 30 years - is climate change to blame?,"Storm Ingunn follows back to back storms that have battered the UK and Ireland this winter.

Norway is reeling from its most powerful storm in more than 30 years, which left some residents without power this morning.

Hurricane-force winds up to 180 kilometres per hour (kph) hit central parts of the country particularly hard yesterday, leading to flooding and widespread travel disruption.

Named Ingunn by Norwegian meteorologists, the storm developed from a very powerful jet stream racing across the Atlantic. This ""explosively deepened an area of low pressure"" which pounded the Scandinavian country from Wednesday afternoon, the UK Met Office's Aidan McGivern explained.

""Norway is used to windy weather, and deep lows, but this is something else,"" he added. Red warnings were put in force by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute - its highest alert. Ingunn is the strongest storm since the country's 1992 New Year's hurricane.

The UK was spared the full ferocity of Storm Ingunn, after experiencing its 10th named storm of the season last week. Storm Jocelyn followed hot on the heels of Storm Isha with wind speeds of up to 156 kph.

Unsurprisingly, many across the UK, Ireland, Norway, Sweden and other storm-hit European countries this winter will be wondering whether climate change is partly to blame.

""This is the furthest through the list we have ever been at this stage,"" a Met Office weather service spokesperson confirmed to Euronews Green last week. But since storms only started being named in 2015, it's not the best way of measuring climate change impacts.

""It's quite a complex issue and not quite as simple as [the] increasing frequency of heatwaves in the UK as a result of human-induced climate change,"" they added.

Britain's average since 2015 has been six or seven storms a year. The first winter after naming began topped out at 11 with Storm Katie. The 2023/24 season could well surpass that - but it's not so significant in the scheme of things. Winter 2013/14 was the wettest on record and the stormiest for two decades.

In the recent climate, there is no evidence of positive or negative trends in windstorm number or intensity, the Met Office says. Trends in storm numbers are difficult to detect due to how they naturally vary year-to-year and decade-to-decade.

That is set to change, according to most climate projections. Scientists predict that winter windstorms will increase slightly in number over the UK and other European countries in the coming years.

Attribution studies can indicate how much more likely and intense a particular weather event was due to climate change. But windstorms don't tend to get prioritised for this sort of scrutiny.

The factors that cause storms to form and be maintained are complex. One of the main drivers is a powerful jet stream - a core of strong winds around 10 km above the Earth's surface, blowing east to west across the Atlantic.

It is influenced by the temperature difference between the pole and the equator. In the past few weeks, bitterly cold Arctic winds have caused a big contrast, leading to a stronger jet stream.

That shapes areas of low and high pressure nearer the surface which translate into stormy weather.

The El Niño weather phenomenon is also having an impact, meteorologists say, as it did in 2014 to 2016 when the UK experienced so many storms.

Warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the Pacific brought by El Niño have knock-on impacts across the world. In northern Europe, it typically brings wetter and windier weather at the start of winter before temperatures drop towards the end.

The relationship between this naturally occurring climate phase and the climate crisis is a subject of ongoing scientific research. But scientists are clear that the impacts of each El Niño are getting ever stronger as the climate warms - meaning more extreme weather.

As with frequency, meteorologists are cautious about stating unequivocally that windstorms are getting stronger as a result of rising temperatures.

But it's clear that climate change is making storms more impactful in various ways.

For one thing, the crisis is influencing the increased rainfall seen in extreme events - like Storm Ciarán in November.

""The reason being is due to every 1 degree of warming we experience, the atmosphere is able to hold 7 per cent more water vapour and therefore we see an increased chance of heavy rainfall associated with rainfall events,"" Dr Melissa Lazenby, a lecturer in climate change at the University of Sussex, explained.

Windstorm impacts from storm surges and high waves in coastal areas are also set to worsen as sea levels rise.

And here's what experts say about intensity. ""When we see a storm, it's likely to be more intense because there's more energy in the atmosphere,"" says Clare Nasir, a senior broadcast meteorologist at the Met Office. ""We know that the Earth is warming up, and that's heat energy. And that heat energy translates into the atmosphere in lots of different ways, including storminess.""

""Climate change is warming both our oceans and our atmosphere, providing more fuel for storms to form and intensify, resulting in heavier downpours,"" Ben Clarke, a researcher for World Weather Attribution at Imperial College London, previously told us.

European countries group together to track and name their extreme weather events. For the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands, storm names are decided by the Met Office, Met Éireann and the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI).

Storms are named alphabetically avoiding the letters Q, U, X, Y or Z to conform with international standards. The names come from the list published at the start of each season in September, which usually alternates between male and female options.

The public can submit names, and some are also chosen by the agencies in honour of esteemed weather experts and scientists.

Norway, Sweden and Denmark name storms as a separate northern group.

""Naming storms helps to ease communication of severe weather and provides clarity when people could be impacted by the weather,"" Met Office head of situational awareness Will Lang explained.

There is no strict set of criteria that the trio of agencies apply to name a storm. They take into account the potential impact of a storm system - assessing whether it could cause flooding, for example.

And as the meteorologists peer into a stormier future, they're clear that broader climate adaptation is needed too.

""The message is we've got to start future-proofing, basically because this is not going to go away in terms of whether it's extreme in one sense or another,"" says Nasir. ""We're in a different landscape to what we were 30 years ago.""","Ingunn is the strongest storm since Norway's 1992 New Year's hurricane.

2024-02-01,Victims left with 'life-changing' injuries after attack in London,"Superintendent Gabriel Cameron said none of their conditions were life-threatening, but the injuries could be life-changing.

A 31-year-old woman and her three-year-old daughter have been seriously injured after corrosive acid was allegedly thrown onto them on Wednesday in the south London borough of Clapham.

At least other nine people, including an eight-year-old girl, were injured in the same attack, the Metropolitan Police said.

Both the woman and the children were taken to hospital, as were three other people who were injured after coming to their aid, Scotland Yard said in a statement.

Detective Superintendent Alexander Castle said three police officers were also taken to hospital after arriving at the scene in Lambeth, but their injuries were minor.

Castle said tests were underway to determine what had caused the injuries, but ""at this stage we believe it was a corrosive substance"". The police are still searching for the attacker who was seen fleeing the scene.

The police air service is taking part in the operation, for which the public has also been asked to help.

Marina Ahmad, a member of the London Assembly, said that both the women and the injured girl were passengers in the car.

The CCTV footage shows a man running around a car before getting into the driver's seat. A woman and her child are sitting in front of the car.

The images show the car running over the woman and then the man stopping the car, getting out and aggressively grabbing the child.

After the incident, the man tried to flee the scene in his car, but collided with another vehicle and left on foot.

""While none of their conditions are life-threatening, the injuries to the woman and the younger girl could be life-changing,"" said Superintendent Gabriel Cameron.

""It may be some time before hospital staff are able to say how serious this could be,"" he added.

One of the witnesses told Sky News what he saw: ""The man grabbed one of the two children violently and slammed them on the floor"".

""The lady then screamed: 'My eyes! My eyes! Call the police, my eyes! Then I saw him run away. It was all so traumatising"".","a 31-year-old woman and her daughter seriously injured in corrosive acid attack.

2024-02-01,Angry farmers invade the streets of Brussels,"Farmers are intensifying their pressure on EU leaders gathered in Brussels today, marking the latest escalation in a Europe-wide campaign that has caused disruptions in several countries.

Belgian farmers took a prominent stance by blocking the city center with their tractors, and their counterparts from Italy and other EU member states swiftly joined the demonstration.

This cross-border solidarity underscores the widespread frustration among European farmers, who are are fuelled by anger over low incomes, rising costs, and regulations associated with EU environmental policies.

The ongoing EU summit, initially intended to focus on aid for Ukraine, has been overshadowed by the farmers' protests. While the demonstrators are aiming to compel EU leaders to address their concerns.

The EU offered to shield farmers from cheap Ukrainian imports and proposed a delay in the implementation of new ecological measures. However, these concessions have not been sufficient to appease the protesters who are demanding further relief.

2024-02-01,UK judge dismisses Trump's lawsuit over salacious dossier,"Document released after former president's inauguration contained lurid stories of supposed sexual dalliances in Moscow.

A judge in London on Thursday threw out a lawsuit by former US President Donald Trump accusing a former British spy of making ""shocking and scandalous claims"" that were false and harmed his reputation.

Judge Karen Steyn found that the case Trump filed against Orbis Business Intelligence should be dismissed.

""There are no compelling reasons to allow the claim to proceed to trial,"" she said.

The ruling comes as Trump is the front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination while facing legal problems on both sides of the Atlantic.

Trump sued the company founded by Christopher Steele, who created a dossier in 2016 that contained rumours and uncorroborated allegations that caused a political storm just before Trump's inauguration. Trump said the dossier was ""fake news"" and part of a political ""witch hunt"""".

Trump sought damages from Orbis for allegedly violating British data protection laws.

At a hearing in October, Trump's lawyer, Hugh Tomlinson, said the former president ""suffered personal and reputational damage and distress"" because his data protection rights were violated.

Steele, who once ran the Russia desk for Britain's Secret Intelligence Service, also known as MI6, was paid by Democrats to compile research that included salacious allegations that Russians could potentially use to blackmail Trump.

Tomlinson said the dossier ""contained shocking and scandalous claims about the personal conduct of President Trump"" and included allegations he paid bribes to Russian officials to further his business interests. Trump's case was that ""this personal data is egregiously inaccurate,"" he said.

In a written witness statement, Trump insisted that despite Steele's assertions that the allegations have not been disproven, they were ""wholly untrue.""

Trump said he had not engaged in ""perverted sexual behaviour including the hiring of prostitutes ... in the presidential suite of a hotel in Moscow,"" taken part in ""sex parties"" in St Petersburg, bribed Russian officials, or provided them with ""sufficient material to blackmail me"". He also said he had not bribed, coerced or silenced witnesses.

Orbis said the lawsuit should be thrown out because the report was never meant to be made public, and was published by BuzzFeed without the permission of Steele or Orbis. It also said the claim was filed too late.

The judge said Trump had ""chosen to allow many years to elapse - without any attempt to vindicate his reputation in this jurisdiction - since he was first made aware of the dossier"" in January 2017.

She said that ""the claim for compensation and/or damages ... is bound to fail.""","Donald Trump sued Orbis Business Intelligence for making ""shocking and scandalous claims"" the former US president said the dossier was ""fake news"" and part of a political ""witch hunt"" Trump's case was that ""this personal data is egregiously inaccurate"".","[('sued', 0.4008), ('trump', 0.3299), ('donald', 0.32), ('dossier', 0.3017), ('orbis', 0.2628), ('claims', 0.2454), ('political', 0.2255), ('case', 0.2227), ('president', 0.168), ('news', 0.1645)]","sued, trump, donald, dossier, orbis, claims, political, case, president, news",31
2024-02-01,Social media CEOs testify in heated US Senate hearing on child safety,"Social media CEOs testified this week in a heated US Senate hearing on child exploitation.

Mark Zuckerberg apologised to parents who said social media has harmed their children during a US Senate hearing on Wednesday

""I'm sorry for everything you've been through,"" the Meta CEO said. ""No one should go through what you and your families have suffered.""

Then he returned to corporate mode, noting Meta's continued investments in ""industry-wide"" efforts to protect children.

Zuckerberg testified alongside CEOs of TikTok, X and other social media companies before the US Senate Judiciary Committee at a time when lawmakers and parents are increasingly concerned about the effects of social media on young people's lives.

""They're responsible for many of the dangers our children face online,"" Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, who chairs the committee, said in opening remarks. ""Their design choices, their failures to adequately invest in trust and safety, their constant pursuit of engagement and profit over basic safety have all put our kids and grandkids at risk.""

In a heated question and answer session with Mark Zuckerberg, Republican Missouri Senator Josh Hawley asked the Meta CEO if he has personally compensated any of the victims and their families for what they have been through.

""I don't think so,"" Zuckerberg replied.

""There's families of victims here,"" Hawley said. ""Would you like to apologise to them?""

Zuckerberg stood, turned away from his microphone and the senators, and directly addressed the parents in the gallery adding that Meta continues to invest and work on ""industrywide efforts"" to protect children.

But time and time again, children's advocates and parents have stressed that none of the companies are doing enough.

One of the parents who attended the hearing was Neveen Radwan, whose teenage daughter got sucked into a ""black hole of dangerous content"" on TikTok and Instagram after she started looking at videos on healthy eating and exercise at the onset of the COVID-19 lockdowns.

She developed anorexia within a few months and nearly died, Radwan recalled.

""Nothing that was said today was different than what we expected,"" Radwan said.

""It was a lot of promises and a lot of, quite honestly, a lot of talk without them really saying anything. The apology that he made, while it was appreciated, it was a little bit too little, too late, of course.""

But Radwan, whose daughter is now 19 and in college, said she felt a ""significant shift"" in the energy as she sat through the hearing, listening to the senators grill the social media CEOs in tense exchanges.

""The energy in the room was, very, very palpable. Just by our presence there, I think it was very noticeable how our presence was affecting the senators,"" she said.

Hawley continued to press Zuckerberg, asking if he'd take personal responsibility for the harm his company has caused. Zuckerberg stayed on message and repeated that Meta's job is to ""build industry-leading tools"" and empower parents.

""To make money,"" Hawley cut in.

The executives touted existing safety tools on their platforms and the work they've done with nonprofits and law enforcement to protect minors.

Snapchat broke ranks ahead of the hearing and is backing a federal bill that would create a legal liability for apps and social platforms that recommend harmful content to minors.

Snap CEO Evan Spiegel reiterated the company's support on Wednesday and asked the industry to back the bill.

TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said the company is vigilant about enforcing its policy barring children under 13 from using the app. CEO Linda Yaccarino said X, formerly Twitter, doesn't cater to children.

""We do not have a line of business dedicated to children,"" Yaccarino said.

She said the company will also support the Stop CSAM Act, a federal bill that makes it easier for victims of child exploitation to sue tech companies.

Yet child health advocates say social media companies have failed repeatedly to protect minors.

""These companies have had opportunities to do this before they failed to do that. So independent regulation needs to step in,"" said Zamaan Qureshi, co-chair of Design It For Us, a youth-led coalition advocating for safer social media.

Republican and Democratic senators came together in a rare show of agreement throughout the hearing though it's not yet clear if this will be enough to pass legislation such as the Kids Online Safety Act, proposed in 2022.

""There is pretty clearly a bipartisan consensus that the status quo isn't working,"" said New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez, a Democrat.

""When it comes to how these companies have failed to prioritise the safety of children, there's clearly a sense of frustration on both sides of the aisle.""

Meta is being sued by dozens of states that say it deliberately designs features on Instagram and Facebook that addict children to its platforms.

Knopfler will donate a quarter of the sales proceeds to various charities, including the British Red Cross and wildlife conservationists Tusk.

Several guitars put up for sale by Mark Knopfler, the former frontman of British rock group Dire Straits, have fetched more than €10 million at auction yesterday.

The sale was led by Knopfler's 1959 Vintage Gibson Les Paul Standard, which sold for £693,000 (€809,900), setting a new world auction record for the model, as well as the 1983 guitar used to record the band's hit songs 'Money For Nothing' and 'Brothers in Arms', which sold for £592,000 (€691,900) at the Christie's sale in London.

""I am so pleased that these much-loved instruments will find new players and new songs as well as raising money for charities that mean a lot to me,"" said Knopfler.

""It has been heart-warming to witness how much these guitars mean to so many people and I am also pleased that they will continue to give joy to many through the songs recorded over the years with me.""

The London auction saw registered bidders and buyers from 61 countries.

The final total, including buyer's premium, was confirmed at £8,840,160 (approx. €10,333,000)

Knopfler will donate a quarter of the sales proceeds to various charities, including the British Red Cross, wildlife conservationists Tusk and children's not-for-profit Brave Hearts of the North East.

Knopfler said the collection was the product of his 60-year ""love affair"" with guitars, but it was time to relinquish ""some of these treasured six-string companions.""

""You can be sure I'll be sad to see them go but we've had wonderful times together and I can't play them all,"" he said. ""To you fellow players, enthusiasts and collectors, I wish you many good times with these old friends of mine.""

2024-02-01,Have any of your car parts been made by forced labour?,"Some of the world's largest car manufacturers are using aluminium produced with forced labour by Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in China's western Xinjiang region and other parts of the country, the US-based non-governmental organisation (NGO) has alleged.

China is accused of running labour transfer programmes in which Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities are forced to work in factories, as part of a longstanding campaign of assimilation and mass detention.

Workers in these programmes reportedly face ideological indoctrination and limited freedom of movement.

Human Rights Watch linked aluminium production to the labour transfer programmes by looking at company statements, Chinese government documents and its own previous research, as well as research by other NGOs.

A United Nations report in 2022 found China may have committed crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, where more than one million Uyghurs are estimated to have been detained. At the time, the Chinese government said the detentions were intended to target terrorism and separatism.

Since 2022, the US has required importers of any goods produced in Xinjiang to provide evidence they were not made with forced labour, in order to avoid penalties.

The Human Rights Watch report argues that, when it comes to aluminium from Xinjiang, its origins are difficult to track, especially when it is shipped to other parts of China and made into alloys.

More than 15% of China's aluminum supply and about 9% of the global supply originates in Xinjiang. The global automotive industry uses it for parts ranging from vehicle frames to wheels and battery foils.

Global demand for aluminium is projected to double between 2019 and 2050, due in part to the growing popularity of electric vehicles, according to the International Aluminium Institute, a UK-based industry group.

""China is a dominant player in the global car industry, and governments need to ensure that companies building cars or sourcing parts in China are not tainted by the government's repression in Xinjiang,"" said Jim Wormington, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.

""Doing business in China should not mean having to use or benefit from forced labour.""

China became the world's largest car exporter last year and is the biggest manufacturer of battery-powered electric cars. The companies listed in the new report also include Chinese electrical vehicle giant BYD.

The Human Rights Watch report alleges that foreign car makers have buckled under the Chinese government's pressure and allowed laxer control of their China operations than in other countries, which increases the risk of using forced labour in their supply chains.

Most foreign car makers in China operate as joint ventures with Chinese firms, due to government restrictions in key sectors.

Toyota later said in a statement it would closely review the Human Rights Watch report, saying regard for human rights was part of its core values.

""We expect our suppliers to follow our lead to respect and not infringe upon human rights,"" it said.

Volkswagen said it had a risk management system in place for due diligence in procuring raw materials and it directly commissions its China suppliers. It added that the company immediately investigates any allegations of forced labour and is looking for new solutions to prevent it in its supply chains.

Volkswagen operates a plant in Xinjiang as part of a joint venture with Chinese state-owned carmaker SAIC Motor. An audit commissioned by the German car maker last year found no signs of forced labour at the Xinjiang plant.

General Motors, Tesla and BYD did not immediately respond to emailed questions about the allegations.

Tesla owns a factory in Shanghai where it builds cars for both the Chinese and international markets. The company told Human Rights Watch it had tracked its supply chain back to the mining level and had not found evidence of forced labour. However, it did not specify how much of its aluminium came from unknown sources and could be linked to Xinjiang.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry has not yet replied to questions concerning the findings, the Associated Press reported.

Separately, the Xinjiang government has today brought in stricter rules governing religious expression, part of a campaign to Sinicize places and forms of worship of the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs.

The rules tighten controls over religious schools, which must be government-sanctioned, and require that Muslims can only perform the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca as part of a group organised by the official Islamic Association of China. They essentially forbid receiving alms, or Zakat, from abroad, according to the human rights research firm Duihua.",China is accused of running labour transfer programmes in which Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities are forced to work in factories.

2024-02-01,Daft Punk are back... Sort of,"Between 1997 and 2013, the famous robotic duo - Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo - released four albums. Seven if you count the 2010 Tron: Legacy soundtrack and both 1997 and 2007 live albums. Their Grammy-winning album 'Random Access Memories' ('RAM') was followed by their break up in 2021.

Now, one of Daft Punk's collaborators during the 'RAM' sessions has confirmed rumours that a recorded and shelved album in 2018 would have been the follow up to what was their final 2013 project.

There's even some chance that the lost album will come out.

In a recent video interview with student-run media organization alt.news 26:46, the band's drummer mononymously known as Quinn, who performed on the majority of the tracks on 'RAM', talked about working with Daft Punk.

He mentioned spending ""four, five days at Henson studios"" with the French duo around 2018.

He said that the unreleased record includes some of his best work, and went on to talk about the possibility of its release: ""I keep checking in. I'm told they're working on it. It's coming out of the locker. I asked Daft Punk permission to talk about it for another article, 'cause they're very secretive as you know. And the greatest guys.""

Quinn mentioned he was ""the first person, the very first person"" called in to work on this lost Daft Punk album, and that Thomas Bangalter was ""just experimenting.""

""That unnamed record, I think will be a lot of spontaneous things,"" he said. ""I remember playing this one thing - my piano board, the insides of a piano - I put my kick pedal on the strings and played it like a kick drum. I remember those guys really loving that. I don't know if it'll make the record. It was the craziest, weird-sounding things.""

Quinn also claimed that he recorded ""more normal drums - a little bit more disco, tighter drums.""

Check out the interview below:

To be continued... But don't expect the band to reform anytime soon.

There have been theories that Daft Punk would make a comeback for the 2024 Summer Olympic Games held in Paris this July and August. These were promptly shut down.

The band members seem content having put an end to the Daft Punk era: ""When we started I was 18 and when we ended Daft Punk I was 46,"" Bangalter said in an August 2023 interview. ""I am relieved and happy to look back on it and say 'OK, we didn't mess it up too much.'""

Last April, Bangalter released a solo orchestral album called 'Mythologies', which was a complete pivot compared to the band's signature sound, but well worth listening to.

In our review, we said that 'Mythologies' ended up sounding like ""the Baroque lovechild of Vivaldi and Philip Glass, and it's... Well, it's sublime.""

It was far more interesting than the stripped down, drumless 'RAM' re-release Daft Punk put out in November 2023 to celebrate the album's tenth anniversary - a complete waste of time that drains the energy of the original album.

That said, apparently Quinn didn't feel too insulted by the drumless version. So that's something.

2024-02-01,WHO cancer agency expects cases in Europe to grow by over 20% by 2045,"A new report ahead of World Cancer Day highlights the growing burden of cancer globally.

The number of new cancer cases in Europe is estimated to grow by 22.5 per cent over the next two decades, according to new estimates from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).

That's as the number of cancer diagnoses grows 55 per cent globally between 2022 and 2045, from roughly 19.9 million cancer cases in 2022 to 30.9 million cases in 2045.

The new estimates were released ahead of World Cancer Day on February 4 and highlight the ""growing burden"" of cancer and a need to address cancer inequities, according to IARC, the cancer agency of the World Health Organization (WHO).

Among the factors that are contributing to the rise include ageing populations, tobacco, alcohol, and obesity as well as air pollution, the agency said.

Currently, about one in five people develop cancer in their lifetime, while around one in nine men and one in 12 women die from it.

As cancer incidence increases, cancer mortality will also increase from an estimated 9.7 million people in 2022 to 16.6 million people globally in 2045.

The number of deaths due to cancer in Europe could rise by 32 per cent, according to the new analysis.

In Europe, the most common type of cancer is breast cancer, followed by prostate and colorectum cancers, according to the 2022 estimates from the IARC, WHO's cancer agency.

The most common causes of cancer death in the EU are lung, colorectal, and breast cancer, according to EU figures.

A new report from the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC), also released this week, found that there are stark inequalities in Europe in terms of access to cancer care.

People with low socioeconomic status in Sweden, for instance, are at a higher risk of dying from cancer compared to those who are more privileged, the UICC said.

In Portugal, around 30 per cent of the most common causes of cancer are linked to tobacco consumption.

""Despite the progress that has been made in the early detection of cancers and the treatment and care of cancer patients, significant disparities in cancer treatment outcomes exist not only between high and low-income regions of the world but also within countries,"" according to Cary Adams, head of the UICC.

""Where someone lives should not determine whether they live. Tools exist to enable governments to prioritise cancer care, and to ensure that everyone has access to affordable, quality services. This is not just a resource issue but a matter of political will"".

Among the measures the UICC has called for include increases in funding for cancer disparities, incorporating cancer services into national health benefits, and implementing common cancer screening programmes.

The new estimates from the IARC's Global Cancer Observatory found large inequities between more developed countries and underdeveloped nations.

In countries with a high Human Development Index (HDI), an indicator based on education, life expectancy, and income, one in 12 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer while one in 71 women will die of it.

But in countries with a low HDI, just one in 27 women is diagnosed with breast cancer but one in 48 women die from it.

""Women in lower HDI countries are 50 per cent less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than women in high HDI countries, yet they are at a much higher risk of dying of the disease due to late diagnosis and inadequate access to quality treatment,"" said Isabelle Soerjomataram, the IARC's deputy head of the Cancer Surveillance Branch.

Overall, the estimated number of new cancer cases in low HDI countries will increase by 107 per cent between 2022 and 2045, while the estimated number of cancer cases in high HDI countries will increase by 36 per cent.

A WHO survey of 115 countries showed, meanwhile, that a majority of countries do not adequately finance cancer services as part of health coverage, with experts calling for major investment to address differences between countries.

The IARC has previously highlighted that estimates should be interpreted with ""caution"" due to the limitations of cancer data worldwide, ""particularly in low and middle-income countries"".","The number of new cancer cases in Europe is estimated to grow by 22.5 per cent over 2022.

2024-02-01,British Museum sheds light on daily life in the Roman army,"London's British Museum's latest exhibition invites visitors to step into the shoes of an ordinary Roman army soldier.

From stone carvings to iron helmets, a new blockbuster exhibition at the British Museum, ""Legion: Life in the Roman Army,"" explores what it was like to be a soldier serving in one of the most elite fighting forces of all time.

Featuring over rare 200 artefacts, including loans from 28 lenders, the exhibition moves past the conventional narrative of a Roman war machine, instead shedding light on the personal stories of real soldiers.

Visitors can discover the first-hand accounts of Terentianus, a recruit from Egypt, who shared his experiences through letters that documented his survival, as well as a Roman soldier, thought to be one of the marines under the command of Pliny the Elder, who became entangled in the eruption of Vesuvius while attempting to help citizens flee.

Carolina Rangel de Lima, the exhibition's curator explains the exhibition transcends ""the big man history that we often get with Roman archaeology - about emperors and great battles - and really focusing in on the personal stories of the soldiers who served in the army.""

The exhibition reflects the day-to-day realities of military life, from the tents they lived in to the games they played to stave off boredom.

Perhaps the star of the show is the only surviving complete Roman scutum - the iconic rectangular and curved shield used by legionaries.

""The scutum from Dura-Europos in Syria, is the only surviving complete Roman shield. I called it a scutum because that's a type of Roman shield that legionaries used. It's the most iconic type that everyone will recognise. It's rectangular and curved,"" explains Carolina Rangel de Lima

She adds: ""It's really remarkable, because it is so unique, but also the beautiful artistry and the artwork on it is really, really rare and very special.""

Also on show and on loan from Germany is the most complete cuirass body armour in the world. It dates back to a major defeat of the Roman army in AD 9, when three legions were ambushed and destroyed by local tribes in the Teutoburg Battle.

It was unearthed at the battlefield in 2018 and this is likely to be the only time it will be seen outside of Germany as it will later go on permanent display at the Museum und Park Kalkriese.

Other notable exhibits include ancient coins, letters written on papyri by soldiers from Roman Egypt, and the preserved remains of a soldier found at Herculaneum, who is reunited with his belt and equipment for the first time outside of Italy.

2024-02-01,Positive environmental stories from 2024 so far,"Climate anxiety is very real, but these good news stories from 2024 prove there is hope for our planet.

Eco-anxiety, climate doom, environmental existential dread - as green journalists, we see these terms used a lot - and often feel them ourselves.

While there's a lot to be worried about when it comes to the climate and nature crises, we must not lose hope - because hopelessness breeds apathy.

The media has an important role to play in combatting climate doom. It's our job to be truthful and accurate in our reporting, not trying to downplay or greenwash the situation. But it's also our job to show that there is hope.

In 2023, as part of our ongoing effort to tackle eco-anxiety (both that of our readers and our own), we kept track of all the positive environmental news throughout the year. We racked up over 200 stories of eco-innovation, green breakthroughs and climate wins - more than double the number in 2022 and a sure sign of momentum.

In 2024, we're confident the good news will keep on coming, as renewable power soars, vulnerable ecosystems gain rights, and climate protocols start to pay dividends.

This article will be regularly updated with the latest good news. It may be something small and local, something silly that made us smile, or something enormous and potentially world-changing.

If you come across a great, positive story that we haven't covered here - please reach out to us on Instagram or X to share your ideas.

Climate change was one of the issues at the top of the list for discussion during the recent World Economic Forum meeting in Davos.

From climate referendums to renewable energy, we took a look at the green credentials of the country where the global get-together was held.

Renewable power sources generated enough energy to meet 100 per cent of Scotland's electricity demand in 2022, recently released government data shows.

Green energy such as wind and hydro generated the equivalent of 113 per cent of Scotland's gross electricity consumption.

This was 26 per cent more than in 2021.

Heavyweights Germany, France and Spain are among 10 member states that have joined Denmark in calling for a 2040 emissions reduction target. This is in line with the advice of EU scientists who say net greenhouse gas output must be slashed to no more than a tenth of 1990 levels.

Denmark is the only country so far to have explicitly endorsed a 90 per cent net reduction target, which equates to a seven-fold reduction from current levels over the next sixteen years.

From a classroom in the Amazon's tallest treehouse, young Peruvians are learning how to defend their rainforest home.

Nestled in the crown of a strangler fig tree, the rangers have a bird's eye view over the canopy.

It's an education in itself, says Juan Julio (JJ) Durand, vice president of Junglekeepers - a nonprofit which conserves threatened habitat in the Madre de Dios (Mother of God) region of Peru's Amazon.

Scientists hope that the first pregnancy of a rhinoceros after an embryo transfer could pave the way to save the nearly extinct northern white rhino subspecies.

The method was tested in another rhino subspecies, with researchers successfully creating a southern white rhino embryo in a lab.

Scientists and veterinarians transferred two southern white rhino embryos into a surrogate mother at a conservancy in Kenya and confirmed a pregnancy of 70 days.

An area of Belgium will soon have new animal-friendly labels on food products.

In Flanders, a Dutch-speaking area in the country's north, packaging will come with information about animal production standards.

The new label, called Beter voor Dieren (Better for Animals), will identify products whose companies have followed ethical procedures when raising animals used for human consumption.

Single-use plastic bag bans have successfully reduced plastic bag use and associated litter and pollution, a new study has found.

Bans in five US states and cities with a combined population of around 12 million people have cut single-use plastic bag consumption by about 6 billion bags per year, according to the research.

Adopting a ban that's similar to the policies in these places could eliminate roughly 300 single-use plastic bags per person per year, according to the report.

Chile and Palau have become the first two countries to ratify a landmark UN treaty for the protection of the high seas.

The UN's High Seas Treaty was adopted last year after almost 20 years of negotiations. More than 80 countries have so far signed it but need to ratify it to be bound by it.

The treaty would become the world's first international law to mandate the conservation and management of marine life in areas beyond countries' national jurisdictions.

From being a kid trapped in a storm to walking the halls of power, 31-year-old David Saddington's life has been shaped by the course of climate change and climate action in the UK.

""It was already clear in 2005 that this issue of 'climate change' was going to affect my life and generations to come,"" he tells Euronews Green from the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. ""So I took it upon myself to make a noise in my school.""

But his fledgling climate activism took an unusual turn when he was invited to Downing Street at 14, to discuss the issue with then Prime Minister Tony Blair. He asked the PM to put climate change on the national curriculum - a measure adopted in 2007.

The greenest city in Europe has officially upped sticks from the Baltic shores of Estonia to the Spanish Mediterranean.

Valencia took over as European Green Capital from Tallinn in a ceremony last week, kickstarting more than 400 sustainable events in 2024.

""Valencia has earned the Green Capital title because of its ambitious sustainability strategy, and it has learned from lessons in the past,"" says EU Commissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries Virginijus Sinkevičius.

Scientists have discovered at least four new octopus species in a roughly 260-kilometre square area off the coast of Costa Rica.

""Through hard work, our team discovered new hydrothermal springs offshore [of] Costa Rica and confirmed that they host nurseries of deep-sea octopus and unique biodiversity,"" says Dr Beth Orcutt from the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences who co-led the expeditions on the Schmidt Ocean Institute's Falkor (too).

The return to power of Polish prime minister Donald Tusk could see one of Europe's least enthusiastic supporters of climate action in recent years throw its weight behind a radical new 2040 emissions reduction target.

Poland's new government has promised a new coal phase-out date as it signalled support for a 90 per cent reduction in net greenhouse gas output across the EU by 2040.

Food scientists have found a way to make chicken nuggets and fish cakes out of otherwise discarded bones and hard tissues.

The idea is to reduce food waste and carbon emissions from animal agriculture, by getting more mileage out of the meat, thereby requiring fewer animals to be farmed for the same output.

Global renewable energy capacity grew by the fastest pace in the last 20 years in 2023, which could put the world within reach of meeting a key climate target by the end of the decade, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

The Paris-based agency said rapid growth of solar in China was the main driver as the world added nearly 510 gigawatts - enough to power nearly 51 million homes for a year - with Europe, the United States and Brazil also seeing record growth.

Solar cells that work in low light could help your devices go battery-free.

California-based company Ambient Photonics has been working on indoor solar cells since 2019, improving the performance and price of this emerging technology.

The cells can be 'printed' in almost any size and shape for use on everyday devices such as remote controls and wireless keyboards, potentially removing the need for batteries and decreasing the size and weight of electronics.

South Korea's parliament has passed a landmark ban on the production and sale of dog meat.

Although only a small minority of people still consume dog meat in South Korea, the ancient practise has been the subject of sharp criticism from foreign media and animal rights advocates. In recent years, the country's younger generations have joined calls to ban it.

On Tuesday 9 January, parliament heeded their calls.

Bratislava is pioneering a new way to recycle cigarette butts.

The Slovakian capital's municipal waste management company announced a new push to collect and reuse discarded cigarettes in 2024.

During the city's Christmas markets, the group trialled special containers designed to collect both standard cigarette filters and those found in modern heated tobacco devices like vapes.

The city plans to use the discarded material to create asphalt for roads.

The UK government has announced it will relax planning rules on protected buildings in England to allow the installation of heat pumps and solar panels.

The measures are part of wider efforts to reach net zero targets.

As of 1 January 2024, organic waste recycling is mandatory in France under new 'compost obligatoire' rules.

With support from the government's Green Fund, municipalities must provide residents with ways to sort bio-waste, which includes food scraps, vegetable peels, expired food and garden waste.

Food waste is responsible for about 16 per cent of the total emissions from the EU food system, according to the European Commission.

If you've been living in the tiny EU state of Luxembourg you will already have had access to free public transport for the last three years.

Unsurprisingly on the anniversary of this novel and seemingly very expensive public initiative, almost everyone who uses trams, buses and trains in the tiny EU state says they're happy with it.

""Since it's free, it's easier to make a decision quickly, to choose between public transport or a private car. This means that it is very positive for the environment and practical,"" one man said whilst using the tram in Luxembourg City.

2024-02-01,Are EVs too heavy to be stopped safely by roadside guardrails?,"Results from crash testing in the US have raised concerns that electric vehicles may be too heavy to be stopped safely by guardrails on roads.

Electric vehicles (EVs) that typically weigh more than internal combustion engine-powered cars can easily crash through steel guardrails on roads that are not designed to withstand the extra force.

That's according to findings from crash test data released on Wednesday by the University of Nebraska in the US, which has raised concerns about EVs and roadside safety.

EVs typically weigh 20 per cent to 50 per cent more than gas-powered vehicles thanks to batteries that can weigh almost as much as a small petrol or diesel-powered car.

And they have lower centres of gravity. Because of these differences, guardrails on roads can do little to stop EVs from pushing through barriers typically made of steel.

Late last year, engineers at Nebraska's Midwest Roadside Safety Facility watched as an electric-powered pickup truck hurtled toward a guardrail installed on the facility's testing ground on the edge of the local municipal airport.

The nearly 4-ton (3.6 metric ton) 2022 Rivian R1T tore through the metal guardrail and hardly slowed until hitting a concrete barrier yards away on the other side.

""We knew it was going to be an extremely demanding test of the [US'] roadside safety system,"" said Cody Stolle who works at the facility.

""The system was not made to handle vehicles greater than 5,000 pounds [2,268 kg]"".

The university released the results of the crash test at a time when the rising popularity of EVs has led transportation officials to sound the alarm over the weight disparity between the new battery-powered vehicles and lighter ICE ones.

Last year, the US National Transportation Safety Board expressed concern about the safety risks heavy EVs pose if they collide with lighter vehicles.

Road safety officials and organizations say the electric vehicles themselves appear to offer superior protection to their occupants, even if they might prove dangerous to occupants of lighter vehicles.

The Rivian truck tested in Nebraska showed almost no damage to the cab's interior after slamming into the concrete barrier, Stolle said.

In response to the release of the test results on Wednesday, Rivian Automotive Inc. noted that the truck used in the testing received a 2023 Top Safety Pick+ award, the highest tier award issued by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.

But the entire purpose of guardrails, found along tens of thousands of miles of roadway, is to help keep passenger vehicles from leaving the road, said Michael Brooks, executive director of the American non-profit Center for Auto Safety.

Guardrails are intended to keep cars from careening off the road at critical areas, such as over bridges and waterways, near the edges of cliffs and ravines, and over rocky terrain, where injury and death in an off-the-road crash are much more likely.

""Guardrails are kind of a safety feature of last resort,"" Brooks said. ""I think what you're seeing here is the real concern with EVs - their weight. There are a lot of new vehicles in this larger-size range coming out in that 7,000-pound [3,175 kg] range. And that's a concern.""

The preliminary crash test sponsored by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Research and Development Center also involved a Tesla sedan crash, in which the sedan lifted the guardrail and passed under it. The tests showed the barrier system is likely to be overmatched by heavier electric vehicles, officials said.

The extra weight of electric vehicles comes from their outsized batteries needed to achieve a travel range of about 300 miles (480 kilometers) per charge.

""So far, we don't see good vehicle-to-guardrail compatibility with electric vehicles,"" Stolle said.

More testing, involving computer simulations and test crashes of more electric vehicles, is planned, he said, and will be needed to determine how to engineer roadside barriers that minimize the effects of crashes for both lighter gas-powered vehicles and heavier electric vehicles.

""Right now, electric vehicles are at or around 10% of new vehicles sold, so we have some time,"" Stolle said. ""But as EVs continue to be sold and become more popular, this will become a more prevalent problem. There is some urgency to address this.""

The facility has seen this problem before. In the 1990s, as more people began buying light-weight pickups and sport utility vehicles, the Midwest Roadside Safety Facility found that the then-50-year-old guardrail system was proving inadequate to handle their extra weight. So, it went about redesigning guardrails to adapt.

""At the time, lightweight pickups made up 10-to-15 per cent of the vehicle fleet,"" Stolle said. ""Now, more than 50 per cent of vehicles on the road are pickups and SUVs.""

""So, here we are trying to do the same thing again: Adapt to the changing makeup of vehicles on the road"".

It's impossible to know what that change will look like, Stolle said.

""It could be concrete barriers. It could be something else,"" he said. ""The scope of what we have to change and update still remains to be determined"".

Philip Jones, executive director of the Alliance for Transportation Electrification, which supports the use of electric vehicles in North America, questioned why electric vehicles were singled out in the testing, noting that several large SUV models can weigh around 6,000 pounds [2,721 kg].

""The EVs are not necessarily heavier,"" Jones said. ""I drive a Chevy Bolt, and it's 3,700 pounds [1,678 kg].""

But he acknowledged that, on the whole, the first generation of electric vehicles are heavier than their gas-powered counterparts. Successive generations are likely to be lighter, he said, as manufacturers work to make smaller batteries that carry more power.

The U.S. Federal Highway Administration declined to immediately comment on the Nebraska test results.

The concern over the weight of electric vehicles stretches beyond vehicle-to-vehicle crashes and compatibility with guardrails, Brooks said. The extra weight will affect everything from faster wear on residential streets and driveways to vehicle tires and infrastructure like parking garages.

""A lot of these parking structures were built to hold vehicles that weighed 2,000 [907 kg] to 4,000 pounds [1,814 kg] - not 10,000 pounds [4,536 kg],"" he said.

""What really needs to happen is more collaboration between transportation engineers and vehicle manufacturers,"" Brooks said. ""That's where you might see some real change.""",Electric vehicles (EVs) that weigh more than internal combustion engine-powered cars can easily crash through steel guardrails on roads.

2024-02-01,Commission's staffing and financing of AI Office raises eyebrows in capitals,"The AI Office, announced by the commission last week (24 January) and set to enter into force on 21 February, will be tasked with supervising the rules for general-purpose AI systems under the upcoming AI Act. It will also function as a central coordination body for AI policy at EU level, coordinating with other commission departments, EU agencies, companies and the 27 EU Member States.

However, the executive's plan to finance its establishment through a reshuffle of the budget of the Digital Europe Program, which is funding designed to go to projects related to cybersecurity and supercomputing, sparked questions from the 27 capitals during a meeting between the commission and diplomats held earlier this week.

Several countries including Denmark, Finland and Sweden asked for more information on how the finances will be redistributed. In addition, they want to be reassured that the new office will be adequately staffed.

The commission said in a response that additional financing was not counted on within the Union' multi-annual budget plan (MFF), which covers the period 2021-2027.

The AI Office will fall under the commissions' digital unit and will therefore be subject to the management plan of DG Connect. According to the minutes, some 100 staff members will be needed. The plan is to attract 80 employees from elsewhere and to transfer 20 people from within the commission to the new office.

As with the AI Office, the executive is also seeking employees to work on incoming platform regulation. In the past months, it sent out several calls for applications to build up a team within DG Connect, combining oversight on the Digital Services act and Digital Markets Act rules, with over 100 full time staff.

France, one of the countries that has been sceptical about the technical details of the AI Act, expressed concerns about the commission's timeframe, as there is no official deal on the AI rulebook yet. Negotiators of the EU institutions are about to close a deal on the technical details on Europe's plan to regulate high-risk AI applications, after a political agreement in December.

If the final text is greenlighted by ambassadors tomorrow (2 February), the European Parliament is expected to vote in its Internal Market and Civil Liberties committees mid-February, and in plenary in March or April. After that, the act is expected to enter into force later this year and includes an implementation period of up to 36 months.

In addition to the AI Office, and national regulators, three other supervision and enforcement bodies will be set up.

The European Artificial Intelligence Board will include representatives of each member state to assist the commission and EU countries and share regulatory experience. A separate Advisory Forum will consist of industry representatives, SMEs and academia to give technical input on the AI Act. And finally, a Scientific Panel, a pool of independent scientific and technical experts, will support the AI Office in the implementation and enforcement when it comes to General Purpose AI models.",the AI Office will be tasked with supervising the rules for general-purpose AI systems.

2024-02-01,EU leaders approve €50 billion deal for Ukraine after Orbán lifts veto,"European Union leaders reached on Thursday morning a deal to establish a €50-billion plan for Ukraine after Viktor Orbán lifted his veto.

The decision was taken surprisingly fast at the beginning of an extraordinary summit in Brussels, where the fund was the main topic on the agenda.

""All 27 leaders agreed on an additional €50 billion support package for Ukraine within the EU budget,"" said Charles Michel, the president of the European Council.

""This locks in steadfast, long-term, predictable funding for Ukraine. EU is taking leadership & responsibility in support for Ukraine; we know what is at stake.""

Until Thursday morning, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán was single-handedly blocking the release of fresh money for Kyiv, despite repeated pleas from the war-torn nation, which needs $37.3 billion, or €34.45 billion, in Western donations to keep its economy running in 2024 and sustain essential services such as healthcare, education, social protection and pensions.

The sense of urgency ratcheted up in mid-December when Orbán made good on his threat and blocked the proposed €50-billion fund leaving the European Commission without any more cash to wire. The legislative impasse in Washington has only compounded the dramatic situation, making the summit a make-or-break date in which leaders had no choice but to break the impasse somehow.

Approving the Ukraine Facility, which is tied to a wider review of the bloc's common multi-year budget, required a unanimous endorsement, a voting rule that Orbán has masterfully exploited in the past to derail collective decisions and extract concessions.",European Union leaders reach a deal to establish a €50-billion plan for Ukraine.

2024-02-01,"For the EU's prosperity, we must empower the single market now","The EU rests on its single market, its singular crowning achievement. To ensure the EU's future competitiveness and prosperity, its leaders must act now to truly empower it, Jacques Pelkmans writes.

When the EU marked 30 years of the single market in 2023, a report should have been written about it but was not even requested.

The core of the unwritten report would have concluded that the union's single market is far weaker than assumed and not nearly as ""single"" as the name suggests.

It is full of shortcomings and contains hundreds of barriers and distortions that seriously and detrimentally impact the EU's ability to stimulate and encourage investment.

This must be addressed by EU policymakers as a matter of urgency. We need immediate and sustained action to deepen and strengthen the single market at the highest political level.

This is why the ""other"" report that should have been commissioned and written last year is so strategic -- even though the term ""strategic"" is mightily overused in today's EU.

But for the health and dynamism of the EU's economy over the long term, there is no action more important and more strategic than empowering the single market. It truly is the EU's trump card in an increasingly unstable and uncertain global order.

The EU could gain as much as 9% of its current GDP if concrete steps are taken now to empower the single market, tantamount to the current combined GDP of the Czech Republic, Belgium and Ireland.

If the EU could induce a greater sense of dynamism via start-ups/scale-ups and a heavier emphasis on R&D and patents, the extra boost in GDP would be even higher.

To achieve this requires real ownership by the EU's political leadership, however. There needs to be firm action by the European Council right after the start of the new European Commission's mandate and the formation of the new European Parliament later this summer.

The new CEPS In-Depth Analysis report ""Empowering the Single Market"" (arguably the unwritten report on the single market that should have been commissioned last year) calls for a medium-term programme that would be decided by the European Council but embraced and implemented by the European Commission, in partnership with the EP. The plan would include regular and rigorous oversight to ensure progress doesn't stall.

At the European Council level, the troika of national presidencies ought to be as active and enterprising as during the early Delors period (late 1985-1988).

There should be a dedicated Commissioner for the internal market, ideally a Vice-President to clearly signal that the single market is a political priority.

The rest of the report's programme mostly outlines substance rather than institutional issues, with one key exception -- enforcement. Infringements are often costly for the single market but hardly so for the relevant member states, even over a period of several years.

Thus, in serious instances, a fast-track procedure or the suspension of a national law should be possible. Finally, the European Parliament's IMCO committee should have annual single market enforcement sessions, with accompanying reports, and extensive hearings giving consumers, citizens and businesses a clear voice.

The substance of the proposed medium-term programme ought to be ambitious. It must be accepted that, in the short run, some measures are bound to be painful for some, otherwise, genuine progress will never be more than piecemeal.

The credibility and effectiveness of the programme hinges first of all on services, with two parallel action plans proposed.

The first is about removing barriers and distortions in services falling under the 2006 Services Directive, with an emphasis on professional services, retail (all the way down to the local level) and construction services.

The second is about services falling under dedicated sector regulation, such as rail freight, as well as effective progress in achieving competitive and larger European capital markets -- crucial for ensuring EU businesses, including start-ups, can access risk capital.

The second plan also stresses the need for the full integration of banking services, the better facilitation of cross-border consumer (and other) finance and more investment in cross-border interconnectors.

The proposed programme's credibility would also rest on ending ""hard fragmentation"", namely consolidating the EU's telecoms market, stricter rules to coordinate spectrum frequencies between member states, the fully-fledged Europe-wide operation of air traffic control, and shifting from a myriad of national copyright rules to a single EU copyright regime.

Other significant moves include the European Commission abandoning its revised approach to harmonised European standards -- this has no useful purpose.

Regulating on issues that are better left to diplomacy, which has severe costs for European companies involved in global value chains, also needs to be stopped.

And finally, support for EU start-ups must be improved to encourage and stimulate more dynamism in the EU economy.

Make no mistake, all of the above is highly ambitious. Enacting such a far-reaching programme will require much political skill, resolve and capital. But the consequences of not doing it would be far worse.

The EU rests on its single market, its singular crowning achievement. To ensure the EU's future competitiveness and prosperity, its leaders must act now to truly empower it.

2024-02-01,"From Asturias to Galicia, Spain's green north is an adventurer's dream","Leave Spain's busy beaches and venture into the lesser explored green north.

Spain often conjures images of sun-kissed beaches and whitewashed villages. Yet, there's a corner of the country that offers a refreshingly different experience: 'Green Spain'.

Galícia, Cantabria, Euskadi (Basque country) and Asturias make up this northern region, a tourist treasure yet to be fully explored by international travellers.

""Green Spain is an ideal destination for those seeking a cool summer filled with authentic experiences,"" Blanca Pérez-Sauquillo, Deputy Director of Marketing Turespaña, tells Euronews Travel.

Green Spain stretches 100 kilometres wide along the coastline of the Cantabrian Sea. Its geographical diversity allows for a stunning juxtaposition of natural wonders, from seaside landscapes to mountains that soar above 2,500 metres in height.

In its entirety, the region encompasses over 2,500 kilometres of coastline, presenting a vast array of diverse landscapes - with a natural haven for every kind of traveller. Whether you're a beachcomber, a mountain enthusiast, or someone seeking the charms of rural life, Green Spain has something for you.

Here's how to get the best out of your visit to Green Spain.

Cutting through the heart of Green Spain's lush landscapes, the Camino de Santiago traverses all the region's provinces, originating from France.

The Camino de Santiago del Norte, designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and snaking 900 kilometres from the French border to Santiago de Compostela, has been a main route for pilgrims coming from Europe for centuries.

During the Middle Ages, the various paths crisscrossing the heart of Green Spain became some of the safest routes for Christians to reach the apostle's tomb in Santiago de Compostela, as they avoided Muslim-occupied lands to the south.

Travellers and pilgrims will enjoy awe-inspiring landscapes, from green meadows and native forests to agricultural land with moss-covered stones.

Take the route running parallel to the sea and you can traverse small mountain ranges, river estuaries, beaches and quaint fishing villages.

Some of these seaside towns have transformed old fishing boats into unique tourist experiences. Boarding one of these vessels and participating in mussel production in a floating nursery or 'batea', while learning about endangered artisanal crafts, offers authentic connection with the region's rich culture.

Drive along the coast and make a stop in villages like Ribadesella, San Vicente de la Barquera, Baiona, Santoña, Bermeo, Cudillero, Elatxobe and Pasaia. There, you can journey into the heart of maritime traditions, where the sea shapes both livelihoods and diets.

Venture behind the scenes on a tour of an anchovy canning factory, and taste the finest preserved treasures from the Cantabrian Sea.

After getting to grips with these coastal delights, foodies can head inland to discover artisanal cheese dairies and organic cider houses.

""At the heart of Green Spain is a specific programme: the Ecotourism Corridor,"" says Pérez- Sauquillo. This project opens up unique experiences in the protected natural spaces of northern Spain. From sighting the majestic brown bear to agrotourism adventures, you'll find plenty of ways to immerse yourself in natural and cultural riches.

On this journey, you can discover the authentic essence of northern Spain's traditional cuisine. ""Asturias leads the way with its Cocina de Paisaje [farm to table] project, showcasing the flavours of the land and rescuing Indigenous products,"" says Pérez-Sauquillo. This experience goes beyond the palate, connecting with the history and traditions of the region.

In Euskadi you can venture into the heart of the countryside to discover charming 'caseríos' crafting natural cider, offering an intimate glimpse into the production process during a 'petit comité' experience. Indulge your taste buds with Idiazabal cheese, all while getting acquainted with the flocks of sheep grazing in the fields and the homes of the skilled shepherds.

In the lush landscapes of Asturias, immerse yourself in the apple-scented air as you explore the Cider Route. While Galícia beckons you on a maritime adventure. Step aboard a fishing boat and live a day in the life of the crew for an unforgettable journey into the heart of Spain's seafaring heritage.

The allure of northern Spain extends far beyond its awe-inspiring landscapes and rich culture. It has become a paradise for surf enthusiasts. Here, surfing transcends being merely a sport; it's a lifestyle that seamlessly intertwines with nature and the sea.

The diversity of the coastline provides a vast array of surf spots. Catch beginner's level waves at Zarautz beach in Euskadi and Rodiles beach in Asturias), or head to Mundaka in Euskadi for world class waves favoured by experienced surfers.

For those in pursuit of wellbeing, Galícia stands as a haven for healing waters, where the appeal of spas continues to grow among both locals and visitors from across Spain and beyond.

""Spas are no longer exclusive to the adult public but have adapted to all ages, following the growing trend of caring for both physical and mental health,"" explains Pérez-Sauquillo.

Explore some of the finest spas that Galícia has to offer, where the therapeutic allure of the waters promises a rejuvenating escape: La Toja, Mondariz, Cuntis, Augas Santas or Laias are some of the best.

Green Spain is much more than a tourist destination; it's an invitation to discover the authenticity and diversity hidden in the country's north. ""This summer, venture beyond the sunny beaches and immerse yourself in the freshness and authenticity of Green Spain"", encourages Pérez-Sauquillo.","Galcia, Cantabria, Euskadi (Basque country) and Asturias make up this northern region, a tourist treasure yet to be fully explored by international travellers.

2024-02-01,COVID vaccine may have short-term impact on menstrual cycles - study,"A French study found an increased risk of changes to women's menstrual cycles after they received the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, but the risk did not last very long.

Could the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines change women's menstrual cycles?

A new French study has found evidence that they might while some experts caution that other factors could also be at play.

The research ""provides new arguments in favour of the existence of an increased risk of heavy menstrual bleeding following vaccination against COVID-19 by mRNA vaccine,"" according to a statementfrom Epi-Phare, an organisation that carries out national health studies for the French government.

The researchers documented the vaccination status of around 4,600 women admitted to hospitals due to significant menstrual bleeding in 2021 and 2022.

They compared their condition to a control group of women who were not treated for this issue.

Their findings suggest that the risk of experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding is marginally higher after a woman receives her first Moderna or Pfizer vaccine, both administered in two consecutive doses.

This increased risk continued for one to three months after vaccination. There was no observed risk of heavy menstrual bleeding after a subsequent booster dose.

""It's important to hear what women have to say,"" Dr Odile Bagot, a gynaecologist who didn't take part in the study, told Euronews Next.

""If there is a causal relationship, it's neither very frequent nor very significant in the end, and it's certainly not persistent beyond three months,"" she added, regarding the study's outcome.

Since initial reports of changes to women's menstruation cycles post-vaccination, several studies have been conducted to determine if that's the case..

A study published in January 2024, which analysed data from users of a period tracker application, concluded that vaccination was ""associated with a small change in cycle length"" that ""resolves quickly within the next cycle"".

Another study drew similar conclusions. Conducted on the Swedish population and published in May 2023 in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), it stated that the ""findings do not provide substantial support for a causal association between SARS-CoV-2 vaccination"" and menstrual disorders reported to health professionals.

""When you have contradictory studies. It doesn't mean that one is lying and the other isn't, it means that the phenomenon is far from certain and not very strong,"" Bagot said.

Other factors could also have played a part in menstrual changes.

""Both the stress of vaccination and the inflammatory and immune phenomena that necessarily follow vaccination can influence the cycle,"" added Bagot.",French study finds increased risk of changes to women's menstrual cycles after COVID-19 mRNA vaccine.

2024-02-01,"'Ursula, we are here!': European farmers' outrage reaches Brussels","Hundreds of tractors will gather in Luxembourg Square in the Belgian capital on Thursday.

On the Paris-Brussels motorway, angry farmers wrote in huge yellow letters visible from afar: ""Ursula, we are here!""

It was chalked on the road with equal parts defiance and desperation, warning European Commission Ursula von der Leyen not to ignore farmers' pleas for better prices and less bureaucracy.

The European Union is holding a summit on Thursday - and von der Leyen, or any other EU leader in attendance, will be looking out their windows at the crowd of farmers protesting in the street.

Hundreds of tractors will gather in Luxembourg Square in the Belgian capital on Thursday to call on European leaders to put an end to free trade agreements between the European Union and third countries, such as Mercosur.

They want a review of agreements such as Mercosur, for imports to be subject to the same rules as European agricultural products, and for the ""costly"" bureaucracy of agricultural and environmental regulations to be made more flexible and simplified.

On Wednesday evening, the first tractors had already begun to pull up around the European Parliament headquarters in Brussels, and from early morning the caravan's horns could also be heard near the European Commission's main building, opposite the Council, where European leaders are meeting.

Farmers blocked more roads in Belgium, France and Italy on Wednesday to disrupt trade at major ports and other strategic sectors, ramping up pressure ahead of an EU summit in Brussels.

French police arrested 91 protesters who stormed Europe's largest food market on Wednesday, police sources said. Armoured vehicles blocked the entrances to the sprawling Rungis market, south of the French capital.

The big question is: why are farmers protesting now?

Over the past two years, the problems facing farmers have reached critical mass.

Unprecedented droughts, fires and floods blamed on climate change devastated crops. The COVID-19 pandemic hit the economy. Russia's war in Ukraine sent energy prices soaring. There was runaway inflation, with agricultural products often unable to keep pace.

""European farmers have been under increasing pressure from many sides,"" said European Commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič. He said that in southern Spain, some water reservoirs were at only 4% capacity. Forest fires have wiped out around 20% of Greece's annual agricultural income.

In hard cash terms, Šefčovič said the value of grain production fell by 30% last year - from €80 billion to less than €60 billion. ""So you have to think about the fact that farmers' incomes are getting lower,"" he said.

The rallies are part of farm protests across the 27-nation EU that have shown how just a few hundred tractors can bring traffic to a standstill in capitals from Berlin to Paris, Brussels and Rome.

Millions of people across the bloc have faced disruption and struggled to get to work, or had doctor's appointments cancelled because protests blocked their way.

""It obviously has a big economic impact. Not just for our company, but for a lot of companies in Flanders and Belgium,"" said Sven Pieters of transport company ECS in the Belgian North Sea port of Zeebrugge.

""It is important that we listen to them,"" said Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo. ""They face huge challenges,"" from adapting to climate change to tackling pollution, he said.

The European Commission has announced plans to protect farmers from Ukraine's cheap war exports and allow them to use some land that has been left fallow for environmental reasons.

The plans still need to be approved by the bloc's 27 member states and the European Parliament, but they represent a sudden and symbolic concession.","Hundreds of tractors will gather in Luxembourg Square in the Belgian capital on Thursday.

2024-02-01,ICJ partially rejects Ukraine 'terror' case against Russia,"Russia and Ukraine swap scores of POWs despite tensions over a plane crash last week

Russia and Ukraine have exchanged about 200 prisoners of war each, the countries said Wednesday, despite tensions stemming from last week's crash of a military transport plane that Moscow claimed was carrying Ukrainian POWs and was shot down by Kyiv's forces.

After the 24 January crash of the Il-76 plane in Russia's Belgorod region near the border with Ukraine, some Russian officials had publicly questioned the possibility of future POW swaps.

Russia's Defence Ministry said the countries exchanged 195 POWs each. After the statement was released, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said 207 Ukrainians were freed. There was no immediate explanation for the different figures.

""We remember each Ukrainian in captivity. Both warriors and civilians. We must bring all of them back. We are working on it,"" Zelenskyy said on X, formerly Twitter.

Dmytro Lubinets, Ukraine's ombudsman for human rights, said on social media that it was the 50th such exchange since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion nearly two years ago, with a total of 3,035 POWs repatriated.

Among the Ukrainians released were members of the armed forces, National Guard, Border Service and national police, said Andrii Yermak, head of Ukraine's Presidential Office. He added that some of them had been captured while defending Mariupol, Azovstal, and Snake Island.

The Russian military said, without providing details or evidence, that the Russian POWs who were swapped Wednesday ""faced deadly danger in captivity"" and will be flown to Moscow for treatment and rehabilitation.

Moscow had said 65 Ukrainian POWs had been aboard the military transport that crashed 24 January. Ukrainian officials confirmed that a swap was due to take place that day and was called off, but said it has seen no evidence the plane was carrying the POWs.

Meeting with his campaign staff in Moscow as he ramps up his run for reelection, President Vladimir Putin said Russian investigators concluded that Ukraine used US-supplied Patriot air defence systems to shoot down the transport plane. Ukrainian officials didn't deny the plane's downing but didn't take responsibility and called for an international investigation.

Putin said Russia wouldn't just welcome but would ""insist"" on an international inquiry on what he described as a ""crime"" by Ukraine.

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) rejected on Wednesday almost all of Ukraine's claims on Russia violating the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.

The United Nations' top court rejected large parts of the case filed by Ukraine, alleging that Russia bankrolled separatist rebels in the country's east a decade ago and discriminated against Crimea's multi-ethnic community, the International Court of Justice ruled Wednesday that Moscow violated articles of two treaties.

Russia has not fulfilled its obligations only on one provision of the convention, said ICJ President Joan Donoghue while reading out the decision in The Hague.

""Russia failed to fulfill its obligations to conduct investigations against individuals who allegedly could finance terrorism in Ukraine,"" she said.

Most of Ukraine's claims under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination were also found to be ungrounded.

""The Court rejects all other claims of Ukraine in relation to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination,"" the order read.

However, it added that Russia had violated its obligations under Articles 2 and 5 of the convention through its implementation of its educational system in Crimea after 2014 with regard to schooling in the Ukrainian language.

Even though it rejected far more of Kyiv's claims under the treaties, Anton Korynevych, a lawyer representing Ukraine at the ICJ, said it was a ""really important day"" because the court had still ruled that Russia had ""violated international law.""

Ukraine sued Russia for violating both conventions in 2017, and labeled breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk ""terrorist organisations financed by Russia.""

Kyiv also insisted that Russia was allegedly conducting a targeted campaign of racial discrimination against Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians in Crimea.

The court also rejected Ukraine's request for Moscow to pay reparations for attacks in eastern Ukraine blamed on pro-Russia Ukrainian rebels, including the 17 July 2014, downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 that killed all 298 passengers and crew.

An artillery unit of the Azov Brigade in eastern Ukraine has used a howitzer to fire at Russian positions, as Ukraine's forces continue to grapple with ammunition shortages.

The unit, embedded in the forest near Lyman, said Russian forces were attempting to advance and their work was crucial to hold them back.

The situation in the Kreminna direction is tense with Russians making assaults every day, the soldiers say.

""As on the entire frontline, it is quite tense here because there are active assaults that we are fighting back and this requires a lot of ammunition,"" said ""Vyarag"", an Azov Brigade howitzer calculation commander.

The brigade is facing a lack of ammunition and parts to repair the American howitzers they received last September.

For now, they have only 10% of the total number they need to fight Russians said one of the commanders of the artillery division.

The brigade said that they are constantly inventing new fighting strategies to deter the Russians, but to go on a counterattack to win, more ammunition is needed.

Even with a shortage of ammunition, soldiers are not lacking motivation.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday chaired a meeting on the economic development of occupied Ukrainian territories.

Moscow spent almost two trillion rubles on a ""comprehensive"" development programme of Russia-held parts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions last year, Putin said.

Over two million local residents there are already receiving social security payments, he added.

""The economy is gradually recovering, including industry. More than one-and-a-half hundred enterprises in mechanical engineering, metallurgy, mining, and other important industries in all these regions have resumed work.

Support for farmers has been established, banks and shops are operating,"" Putin claimed.

He urged Russian banks to start working in the occupied territories.

""Everything that was feared before - sanctions - has already happened. What is there to be afraid of? You need to enter these territories and work more actively there,"" Putin said.","Russia and Ukraine exchange about 200 prisoners of war each, the countries say.

2024-02-01,Alec Baldwin pleads not guilty to new involuntary manslaughter charge,"Hollywood actor Alec Baldwin faces up to 18 months in prison if convicted. He remains free pending trial under conditions that include not possessing firearms, consuming alcohol or leaving the country.

Actor Alec Baldwin has pleaded not guilty to an involuntary manslaughter charge in the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins during a rehearsal on the set of Rust.

Court documents filed Wednesday (31 January) show Baldwin, 65, entered the plea in state district court in Santa Fe, waiving an arraignment that had been scheduled to take place remotely by video conference the next day.

Baldwin, the lead actor and a co-producer on the Western movie, was pointing a gun at Hutchins during a rehearsal outside Santa Fe in October 2021 when the gun went off, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza.

A grand jury in Santa Fe indicted Baldwin in January after prosecutors received a new analysis of that gun, renewing a charge that prosecutors originally filed and then dismissed in April 2023.

Baldwin faces up to 18 months in prison if convicted.

The actor remains free pending trial under conditions that include not possessing firearms, consuming alcohol or leaving the country. Baldwin can have limited contact with witnesses when it comes to promoting Rust, which has not been released for public viewing. Baldwin is prohibited from asking members of the Rust cast or crew to participate in a related documentary film.

Rust weapons supervisor Hannah Gutierrez-Reed also has been charged with involuntary manslaughter, with a jury trial scheduled to start on 22 February. She has pleaded not guilty to that charge and a second charge of tampering with evidence in Hutchins' death.

Gutierrez-Reed also was charged with carrying a gun into a downtown Santa Fe bar days before she was hired to work as the armorer on Rust. She has pleaded not guilty to that charge too.

The fatal shooting of Hutchins resulted in a series of civil lawsuits, including wrongful death claims filed by members of Hutchins' family, centered on accusations that Baldwin and producers of Rust were lax with safety standards. Baldwin and other defendants have disputed those allegations.

Rust assistant director and safety coordinator David Halls pleaded no contest to unsafe handling of a firearm last March and received a suspended sentence of six months of probation. He agreed to cooperate in the investigation of the fatal shooting.",Alec Baldwin pleads not guilty to involuntary manslaughter charge.

2024-02-01,"US carry out attacks on Houthi, WHO struggling to reach hospitals","All the latest developments on the Israel - Hamas war and the conflict in the Middle East.

American forces have carried out strikes in Yemen against 10 attack drones and a ground control station belonging to the Iran-backed Houthi rebels, according to the US military.

The United States Central Command, known as centcom, claimed they ""presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and the US Navy ships in the region.""

Centcom earlier announced that vessels had also shot down an anti-ship ballistic missile fired by the Houthis, and then downed three Iranian drones less than an hour later.

It did not specify if the drones shot down by the naval destroyer were designed for attack or surveillance.

The Houthis began targeting Red Sea shipping in November, saying they were hitting Israeli-linked vessels in support of Palestinians in Gaza, which has been ravaged by the war.

US and UK forces have responded with strikes on the Houthis, who have since declared American and British interests to be legitimate targets as well.

World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus said on Tuesday that they have faced great difficulty to reach hospitals in southern Gaza.

Heavy fighting has been reported near hospitals in Khan Younis, severely impeding access to health facilities for patients, health workers and supplies, he said.

Dr Tedros told reporters that a UN mission on Monday 29 January delivered medical supplies to Nasser Medical Complex.

He said other missions to deliver fuel and food were denied, adding that despite challenges, ""Nasser hospital continues to offer health services, albeit at reduced capacity.""

2024-02-01,Greta Thunberg to appear in UK court over Oily Money Out protest,"The Swedish climate activist was arrested amidst a crackdown by the UK government on 'disruptive' protests.

Greta Thunberg and four other climate activists are due to appear in court today after being arrested at a protest outside the Energy Intelligence Forum in London last October.

The action was part of Oily Money Out - a series of disruptions against the carbon emissions, political influence and lobbying of the fossil fuel companies and banks attending the conference by the group Fossil Fuel London.

The Swedish climate activist was detained while demonstrating with hundreds of other protesters outside the Energy Intelligence Forum, at the InterContinental London Park Lane hotel in Mayfair.

""Hosting an oil and money conference in the middle of the unfolding climate emergency was obscene and sickening,"" says Nicola Harries, lawyer and Extinction Rebellion supporter.

""Our politics has been held hostage by these criminal banks and criminal fossil fuel companies who are holding back the transition we urgently need.

""Why do we allow them to rake in record profits while the world burns, people drown, lose their homes and go hungry? As usual our 'justice system' is putting the wrong people in the dock.""

The arrests came after a UK government crackdown on ""disruptive"" protests which saw the UN Special Rapporteur on environmental defenders criticise these ""regressive new laws"".

The five activists including Thunberg were charged with failing to comply with a condition imposed under section 14 of the Public Order Act, mainly for failing to leave the highway and continue the protest on the pavement.

If found guilty, she could be fined up to £2,500 (€2,932).

All five activists pleaded not guilty. Amendments to this legislation were controversially brought in by then-Home Secretary Suella Braverman alongside other measures to expand police powers to deal with the kind of protests favoured by climate activists.

Greta Thunberg has been arrested several times in the last 12 months, the first time in June 2023. In October she was fined by a Swedish court for disobeying police at a climate protest at an oil terminal in Malmo. It was the second time she had been fined in Sweden for a similar offence.

The Swedish climate activist admitted to the facts but denied guilt adding that the fight against the fossil fuel industry was a form of self-defence due to the existential and global threat of the climate crisis.

After the verdict, she said she would continue to protest even if it ""leads to more sentences"".","Greta Thunberg and four other climate activists are due to appear in court today.

The orphan-turned-scullery maid because of her wicked stepmother... The pale beauty who threatens the evil Queen as ""the fairest in all of the land"" in the first animated feature film produced in the US. You know the one.

Well, as a welcome break from all the online bashing concerning the race-swapped remake which has been pushed back to 2025 because of the backlash and the fact that the House of Mouse is not doing so well right now, it may seem like audiences have been getting the 1937 classic all wrong.

Incidentally, are we sure the whole talking mirror bit wasn't the envious matriarch having a full-blown mental breakdown and that the object wasn't just inanimately minding its own business, thereby revealing that Queenie needed a hefty dose of therapy? Food for thought... But back to the scene.

What does the Queen say?

If you automatically went to: ""Mirror mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?', you're not alone.

The iconic line is enshrined in pop and cinematic culture. Right? Right???

Wrong.

A TikTok has shocked many online after the user, creator @wordwaster333, realised that it was never ""Mirror mirror"", but rather ""Magic mirror.""

Cue: startlement, confusion, and the reigniting of the ever-present fear that we're all living in a Matrix -style simulation and we're experiencing another glitch.

The video tallied more than 10 million views, with the general consensus being that it's another example of the Mandela Effect.

If you're not familiar with the term, the Mandela Effect is a rather fascinating phenomenon that refers to people sharing a collective, inaccurate memory (an event, an image, a phrase) that never happened.

It got its name in 2009 from Fiona Broome (a self-described paranormal researcher), who referred to the false memory thousands of people held when they claimed to remember news coverage of Nelson Mandela dying in prison in the 1980s, despite the fact he died in 2013.

Notable examples of these false memories include people thinking that Mr. Monopoly donning a monocle (he doesn't); Mickey Mouse wearing suspenders (nope); Star Wars' C-3P0 being entirely golden (he has a silver leg); there's no hyphen in between ""Kit"" and ""Kat""; it's a beautiful day in this neighbourhood (not ""in the neighbourhood""); it's Sex And The City, not ""In""); it's never been Looney Toones but Looney Tunes; and many people are still convinced that New Zealand is located northeast of Australia, when it's in fact southeast of the country.

That last one is less about the Mandela Effect and not enough time spent nose-deep in an Atlas... But we'll give it a pass.

Confabulation, misleading information spread on social media and the role of Internet could all be explanations. After all, the effect has grown in the digital age, and with the frantic pace information is consumed nowadays, false memories aren't exactly surprising.

We're still banking on alternate realities though.

If you're interested, one of our favourite X Files episodes, Season 11 Episode 4's The Lost Art of the Forehead Sweat, deals with and satirizes the phenomenon - with Trump and his MAGA bunch in its visor. Check it out.

Over the years, the collective misremembering has sparked discussions about reality, the trustworthiness of memories, the possibility that the multiverse exists, and that there is a shadowy cabal altering beloved pop culture mainstays in order to induce collective psychosis.

Now, it would seem that a fresh bunch awoken to the fact they've fallen prey to the Mandela Effect with the misquoting of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, as the line in the film actually starts with ""Magic mirror on the wall.""

To be fair, few recall the line accurately, and it probably doesn't help that Julia Roberts and Lily Collins starred in a 2012 live-action film based on Snow White called Mirror Mirror...

However, to soothe you and your paranoia, dear reader, there's a possibility that some are not real victims of the Mandela Effect here.

You see, the original Brothers Grimm tale uses ""Mirror mirror""; it's only the Disney animation that refers to it as ""Magic mirror"".

So technically, you're not wrong either way with the Queen's famous line. Unless you bite the bullet and admit to yourself and others that you've never read the original Grimm (by name, grim by nature) tale, and therefore can't use this particular loophole. In which case, you've been Mandela-ed!

Oh, and incidentally, Darth Vader says ""No, I am your father"", not ""Luke, I am your father"" in The Empire Strikes Back.","""Mirror mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?"" is the famous line in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The iconic line is enshrined in pop and cinematic culture.

2024-02-01,How two twins separated and sold at birth reunited 19 years later,"Separated and sold at birth, a pair of identical Georgian twins found each other 19 years later by chance, shedding light on a dark era of baby trafficking in Georgia.

Amy Kvitia and Ano Sartania, identical twins born in western Georgia in 2002, were tragically separated at birth and unknowingly sold to different families, their existence concealed from their adoptive parents.

Their biological mother was falsely told that the children had died at birth.

Years later, in a twist of fate reminiscent of Lindsay Lohan's The Parent Trap, the two twins stumbled upon one another unexpectedly.

In an interview with Georgian media, the twins revealed their remarkable journey of reconnection, recounting the peculiar instances where glimpses of their mirrored selves appeared throughout their lives.

Their journey to reconnection began when they were 12 years old, when Amy saw Ano participating in a TV talent show.

""I was at my godmother's house in Poti, and we were watching 'Georgia's Got Talent.' I saw myself on the stage, and I was thinking I had never been in 'Georgia Got Talent',"" recalls Amy.

""Then people started calling my mother, and my godmother and relatives came, saying, 'Why didn't you tell us that you were participating in the show? Why were you using a different name?' I said that it was not me; I did not know.""

Seven years later, in November 2021, Amy posted a video of herself with blue hair getting her eyebrow pierced on TikTok. Two hundred miles away, Ano Sartania received the video from a friend, setting off a chain of events that would bring them closer than ever before.

""I put the photo of Amy in a university group, saying I dyed my hair and got a piercing. Some people were saying it suits you so much, but you look a bit different,"" jokes Ano.

She continues: ""And then one girl, Amy's friend, writes, 'It is not you.' I had accompanied her to get the piercing. At that moment, I was like, 'Give me her name, surname, tell her to add me to friends; I need to see her.' And when she added me, we simultaneously wrote to each other ""how long I had been searching for you.""

A few days later, the twins arranged to meet for the first time in the Tbilisi metro, ""I thought I was looking into the mirror,"" Ano says.

Neither Ano nor Amy knew until they found their identical twin that they were adopted.

Their adoptive parents kept the secret from the girls - although even they were not aware that their adoptive child had an identical twin.

The twins' story sheds light on a dark era where thousands of children in Georgia were taken from their birth parents, who were deceived into believing their children had died at birth.

In their pursuit for answers on their adoption circumstances, the twins discovered the Facebook group ""Vedzeb,"" translating to ""I'm searching"" in Georgian, set up by Georgian journalist Tamuna Museridze.

The online community, which has more than 230,000 members, serves as a platform for mothers who were falsely informed by hospital staff that their babies had died.

After sharing their story on the page, Amy and Ano received a reply from a young German woman, saying her mother had given birth to twin girls in Kirtskhi Maternity Hospital in 2002 and that despite being they had died, she now had some doubts.

DNA tests revealed that the girl from the Facebook group was their sister, and was living with their birth mother, Aza, in Germany.

In an emotional moment captured in a new film by the BBC titled ""Betrayal at Birth: Georgia's Stolen Children"", the twins were reunited with their mother.

The twins share that their mother clarified that she had fallen seriously ill after giving birth, falling into a coma. Upon regaining consciousness, hospital staff allegedly informed her that the newborns had passed away shortly after delivery.","Georgian twins Amy Kvitia and Ano Sartania were separated at birth and sold to different families.

2024-02-01,Why is the French city of Nantes flying the Nazi flag?,"Iconic buildings in Nantes have been draped in Nazi banners over the past few days, which has caused a stir on social media. The Cube takes a look at why they're there.

Social media users are sharing images of the Graslin Theatre in Nantes, western France, covered in Nazi flags. Some of the posts include outlandish claims that the city is under occupation or invasion, while others describe a bizarre atmosphere in the air.

Others show old-style cars, or seemingly portray Nazi soldiers in the city.

The pictures are indeed real, but any claims on social media that the flags' presence is due to some sort of ""invasion"" or ""leftist and Islamist"" plot are not.

Rather, production company Rezo Productions has been filming its new fantasy series ""Deep"" in the city.

Set in 1941, the series tells the story of a newly occupied France which discovers that the Third Reich has developed a new type of submarine that can travel through time.

There are various clues that prove the Nazi flags in Nantes were all part of a set. In some of the shots, you can clearly see camera crews, lights and cranes - and what's more, a quick Google search will also show that the whole thing is being widely reported by French media.

Some of the stories act as a warning so that people are aware of what's going on, while others report on citizens' reactions.

For good measure, The Cube got in contact with Nantes' town hall, who confirmed that the flags are indeed in the city as part of a shoot.

The Nazi occupation is a firm part of Nantes' history, following the fall of France.

During the Second World War, German troops entered and conquered the city, taking control in June 1940.

Camps were set up around Nantes for prisoners of war - but the city also played host to small resistance groups.

A key moment in the Nazi-occupation of Nantes was the execution of 48 civilians in 1941, in retaliation for the assassination of German officer Karl Hotz.

They are known as the ""50 hostages"", because the Nazis originally planned to kill 50 of them.","Social media users are sharing images of the Graslin Theatre in Nantes covered in Nazi flags.

2024-02-01,EU leaders meet with one mission: make Orbán lift his veto on Ukraine,"Brussels is on Thursday set to be the scene of a momentous summit where European Union leaders will plead with Viktor Orbán to lift his intractable veto on a €50-billion special fund for Ukraine.

The Hungarian premier is single-handedly blocking the release of fresh money for Kyiv, despite repeated pleas from the war-torn nation, which needs $37.3 billion, or €34.45 billion, in Western donations to keep its economy running in 2024 and sustain essential services such as healthcare, education, social protection and pensions.

The sense of urgency ratcheted up in mid-December when Orbán made good on his threat and blocked the proposed €50-billion fund leaving the European Commission without any more cash to wire. The legislative impasse in Washington has only compounded the dramatic situation, making Thursday's summit a make-or-break date in which leaders have no choice but to break the impasse somehow.

Approving the Ukraine Facility, which is tied to a wider review of the bloc's common multi-year budget, requires a unanimous endorsement, a voting rule that Orbán has masterfully exploited in the past to derail collective decisions and extract concessions.

""The level of nervousness is quite high. But we need to stay calm and focused,"" said a senior EU official, describing the political atmosphere in anticipation of the occasion.

""We're doomed to unanimity.""

Officials in Brussels have spent the past weeks scrambling to understand what exactly Hungary wants in exchange for lifting the veto. However, according to diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the ongoing negotiations, the signals they so far received from Budapest have been irritating at best and unpalatable at worst.

Under the proposal on the table, the Commission will oversee the disbursements of the Facility, averaging €12.5 billion in a mix and grants every year until 2027, and report back to the Council and the European Parliament. Kyiv, in turn, is expected to meet a series of conditions to gradually access the funds.

Hungary demands an annual review of the entire facility, an idea that diplomats interpret as a poorly-veiled attempt to ensure that Orbán would have ample opportunities to wield his veto. Additionally, the country has asked for changes to the COVID-19 recovery funds, which it has been unable to unlock due to rule-of-law deficiencies.

Budapest has also expressed opposition to paying for the interest rates that stem from the Ukraine Facility and the COVID-19 recovery funds, both of which are partially financed by the joint issuance of debt and will need to be progressively repaid.

On top of that, Orbán and his deputies have become increasingly vocal about the release of frozen cohesion funds. Although the Commission controversially unsealed €10.2 billion right before the December summit, about €11.7 billion remains held up. Orbán frequently describes the long-running dispute as financial ""blackmail.""

The amalgam of unrelated requests suggests there might be space, albeit limited, to find a compromise at the end of Thursday's meeting. As a manageable alternative to the annual review, some countries have floated an ""annual debate"" about the Facility's implementation, rather than its core principles and financial figures. The high-level discussion will not be subject to a vote and therefore shielded from veto.

""We'll have to wait until the start of the meeting tomorrow and hear from Viktor Orbán what his room for manoeuvre is,"" said a senior diplomat.

""Nobody is willing to introduce new vetoes,"" the diplomat went on. ""One way or the other, we need to get money to Ukraine.""

If Orbán digs his heels in and refuses to budge, leaders could be forced to opt for a makeshift solution backed only by 26 member states. Building a new financial structure from scratch, instead of using the existing EU budget, will be energy-consuming and entail parliamentary procedures at a national level.

More worryingly, such a Plan B would mark the death of the political unity built in the wake of Vladimir Putin's decision to launch the all-out invasion. The unity, which Orbán has repeatedly put to the test, has been instrumental in approving 12 rounds of sanctions against the Kremlin and ensuring continued financial and military support for Ukraine.

""This will be a defining moment,"" said a senior diplomat from another country. If leaders fail to reach an agreement at 27, ""someone else would celebrate.""

The stakes have become so high - and the odds so precarious - that some officials have revived the long-dormant conversation about Article 7, the ""nuclear option"" under the EU treaties to rein in countries who commit serious breaches of the bloc's fundamental values. Under the article's very last step, which has never been triggered, the accused state can be stripped of voting rights.

But moving Article 7 forward requires unanimity and it's unclear if all the 26 will be on board with the idea of punishing Hungary in such a radical way. Slovakia, under Robert Fico's rule, is the first guess in Brussels when it comes to potential obstacles.

Leaders might prefer to be more practical and go down faster avenues. The obstruction of the Ukraine Facility has hindered the review of the bloc's common budget. In the proposal that was nearly approved in December, member states agreed to earmark €9.6 billion for migration, €1.5 billion for cutting-edge technologies, €1.5 billion for emergency assistance and €2 billion for a flexibility instrument to react to unforeseen crises.

From the very beginning, Brussels linked the Facility to the budget top-ups and made the two inseparable from each other. Speculation about a ""decoupling"" strategy has been simmering for months and could turn into action if Orbán insists on his veto.

Besides the Ukraine aid and the common budget, leaders will discuss ammunition deliveries to Kyiv, the Israel-Hamas war, the crisis in the Red Sea, the controversy surrounding UNRWA and the growing farmers' protests.","Brussels is set to be the scene of a momentous summit where European Union leaders will plead with Viktor Orbán to lift his intractable veto on a €50-billion special fund for Ukraine.

2024-02-01,Why did markets fall after Fed meeting and Powell's remarks?,"Signs of a challenging day in financial markets were already evident as yesterday's session opened in New York. The downward momentum was initially driven by disappointing quarterly earnings from technology powerhouses Alphabet and AMD, both of which are at the forefront of artificial intelligence innovation.

Yet, it was the Federal Reserve's actions and Chairman Jerome Powell's comments that precipitated Wall Street's most tumultuous day since September 2023.

The decision to keep interest rates steady at 5.25%-5.5% wasn't the main story, as it was largely expected by market participants.

Instead, it was how the Fed and Jerome Powell reacted to traders' optimistic anticipation of a March rate cut that sent ripples through markets.

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) observed that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace, with a still strong labour market despite moderated job gains. Inflation has shown signs of easing over the past year but still remains elevated.

The Federal Reserve opted to use both a sweet and sour approach in its outlook for future interest rates.

On the positive side, references to future rate hikes were notably toned down, if not entirely removed.

The phrase ""in determining the extent of any additional policy tightening that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2% over time"" has been altered to: ""In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving economic outlook, and the balance of risks.""

However, the Fed expressed a cautious stance on imminent rate cuts, dampening the hopes of those betting on a reduction in March. The statement highlighted that the Committee needs greater confidence in inflation trending sustainably towards 2% before considering lowering rates.

Fed Chair Powell was more forthright and explicit compared to the formal policy statement issued by the Federal Reserve.

The Fed Chair stated that it is ""unlikely"" that the committee will be sufficiently confident by March to implement rate cuts.

""Based on today's meeting, I would tell you that I don't think it's likely that the committee will have the requisite confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify March as the appropriate time for such action,"" Powell remarked.

Powell's acknowledgment of the US economy's resilience, highlighted by a 3.3% GDP growth in the fourth quarter, underscores that the Fed is in no rush to cut interest rates.

Yet, Powell's insistence on not just reaching but convincingly maintaining the 2% inflation target points to a longer horizon for policy easing than markets had hoped.

In December, the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, remained steady at 2.6% year-on-year, the lowest level in nearly three years.

But despite improvements in inflation, Powell emphasised the ongoing challenge, stating, ""It's still too high, and there is no certainty about continued progress in bringing it down.""

The past six months of benign inflation data do not seem to be sufficient to convince the Federal Reserve that price pressures are consistently moving toward the 2% target.

The probability of a rate cut at the March 20, 2024 meeting witnessed a significant decline following Jerome Powell's remarks.

Traders now assign a 36% chance of a rate cut, down from the previous 50% estimate before the Federal Reserve meeting, and well below the nearly 90% chance of a month ago. Nevertheless, speculators still anticipate a reasonably aggressive cycle of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, factoring in six consecutive cuts starting from the May meeting.

Markets did not react favorably to Jerome Powell's press conference. The hawkish sentiment by the Fed chair pushed the S&P 500 index to close at its daily lows, down 1.6%. This marks the worst session since September 21, 2023.

The technology-focused Nasdaq 100 index underperformed, closing down 1.94%, in its worst day since late October.

The hawks have regained the upper hand, at least for now, buoyed by the resilience of the U.S. economy. However, an important test looms on the horizon this Friday with the release of the January jobs report.

It will shed light on how long the Federal Reserve can realistically hold interest rates high for longer.","Traders now assign a 36% chance of a rate cut at the March 20, 2024 meeting.

2024-02-01,All bets off as Kosovo and Serbia face currency crisis,"Kosovo is adopting a new regulation that is erasing the Serbian minority's dinar from the country's economy. Political tensions are on the rise.

Kosovo appears to be risking a new wave of ethnic tensions with a decision to remove the Serbian dinar from its monetary system.

A new regulation, coming into force today, 1 February, states: ""The only currency accepted for cash payments or transactions in Kosovo is the euro,"" reported AFP.

Kosovo adopted the euro in 2002, despite neither being a member of the European Union nor the eurozone, the area sharing the euro currency.

Banning transactions in dinars could effectively lock out the local minority of Serbs, who use the currency widely, from the financial system in Kosovo. That could bring about another crisis with Serbia.

Following the war between the two territories that ended in 1999, Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008. However, the latter has never officially acknowledged it. The two sides are regularly locked in bitter disagreements, even over minor issues such as licence plates.

Although Kosovo has adopted the euro, it has tolerated the use of the Serbian dinar over the years because of the approximately 120,000 Serbs living there. They receive their salaries and pensions in dinar.

Belgrade supports the Serbian community in Kosovo, with jobs and financial aid to the equivalent of €120 million each year.

The new ban leaves Kosovo Serbs with a vast amount of uncertainty. As a result of it, several banks in northern Kosovo started to close on Tuesday because they could no longer operate without a new licence or authorisation from the central bank.

One local resident made his views clear. ""I have the impression that everyone is playing with us,"" Zoran Ilic from Mitrovica told AFP. ""No one tells us anything ... I'm fed up with politics.""

Serbia has chosen this moment to consider reintroducing compulsory military service. However, President Aleksandar Vučić, making the announcement on Tuesday, cited tensions in the Balkans and elsewhere in Europe as a reason for considering doing so, rather than the potential currency crisis.

Meanwhile, Kosovo's biggest political and financial allies are urging the country to suspend the ban amid fears of a rise in political and diplomatic tensions.

""We are concerned about the impact of the regulation in particular on schools and hospitals, for which no alternative process seems viable at the moment,"" Reuters reported, quoting a joint statement issued on Saturday from the ambassadors of France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy and the United States.

The ambassadors called for a longer transition period and asked that the public be given a clear direction as to what was going to happen.

Authorities in Kosovo said that the new regulation has been introduced to fight corruption and money laundering.

First Deputy Prime Minister Besnik Bislimi said the new ban would put a stop to the flow of unregulated money from Serbia. AFP quoted him as saying: ""Money continues to cross borders in travel bags and then be distributed by unregistered and unlicensed offices.""

The Serbian government sees Kosovo's move as provocative and analysts say it is almost certainly going to damage continuing efforts to calm tensions between Belgrade and Kosovo.","Kosovo adopts new regulation that is erasing the Serbian minority's dinar from its economy.

2024-02-01,Barcelona could face severe water restrictions as drought worsens,"Citizens could be fined for washing cars or watering gardens.

After months of warnings, Catalan authorities are expected to declare a drought emergency today.

This could mean more extreme water restrictions for six million people in Barcelona and the 201 surrounding municipalities in northeastern Spain.

Washing a car or watering the garden could result in fines of up to €50. If a citizen in Barcelona committed a serious 'water offence', they could be fined up to €3,000.

Catalan authorities declared a state of pre-emergency in November last year. Now, high temperatures have reduced the already low water levels in reservoirs.

""Our reserves are below 16%. The situation is critical in Barcelona and around Girona, so we have to take stronger measures,"" Catalan government official Laura Vilagrà told Spanish radio station RNE on Wednesday.

The region's almost 40-month-long lack of rain has exacerbated the situation.

The plan drawn up by the authorities is divided into three phases, which will vary depending on how the drought worsens.

In the first phase, water consumption will be limited to 200 litres per person per day; in the second phase, it will fall to 180 litres; and in the most severe phase, to 160 litres.

According to the latest data from the National Statistics Institute, Spaniards use an average of 133 litres of water per day.

The authorities are also planning to reduce water pressure. However, the city of Barcelona does not expect this measure to be implemented in households until July in the worst case.

Fines could be imposed on local councils to force them to monitor water consumption more closely.

Just this week, as the whole town of Esponellá in Girona was trying to save every drop of water, it emerged that one of its neighbours was wasting five million litres of water a year.

The Catalan Water Agency sent the town a warning that it was exceeding the average water consumption per inhabitant. The town council then asked the agency to send them a list of the residents who used the most water.

According to statements made by the authorities to the local media, the neighbour now faces a fine of €3,000, while the authorities are considering cutting off his connection to the network.

The area affected by the emergency drought measures stretches from northern Catalonia to the French border.

Agriculture and industry will also face cuts. The regional emergency declaration aims to reduce water for crop irrigation by 80%, for livestock by 50% and for industry by 25%. The less populated southern part of the region is fed by the Ebro river and is in better shape.

Catalonia has experienced 40 consecutive months of below-average rainfall. Experts say climate change is driving the drought, with the entire Mediterranean region expected to warm faster than many other parts of the world in the coming years.

""Droughts are natural in the Mediterranean climate pattern. What is very dramatic are the projections of climate change. ... What we are seeing is an increase in the intensity and frequency of droughts,"" Annelies Broekman, a water management specialist at the Barcelona-based research institute CREAF, told the Associated Press.

Broekman noted an important difference between the extraordinarily intense dry spell northeastern Spain is experiencing now and the last serious drought in Catalonia in 2008, when boats were used to transport water to Barcelona.

""In 2008, sometimes it rained a little bit in important places, so we had little moments when all of nature could, let's say, take a break,"" she said. ""[This time] we are below, really below, the normal pattern for a continuous period of time. And that is actually what hurts the most, because we can be quite resistant to periods of drought that have some respite.""

Catalonia has been facing rolling water restrictions for several years. Bans on watering lawns, filling private swimming pools and washing cars remain in place. Local authorities can't use drinking water to clean streets.

Catalonia has so far been able to avoid more draconian restrictions, thanks largely to desalination and water recycling systems, which now account for 55% of the region's total water consumption. The Spanish authorities are spending millions of euros to expand or build new desalination plants along coastal areas that suffer the most from drought.

However, both Catalonia and the southern Spanish region of Andalusia are preparing to import water by boat if needed this summer, an expensive option that officials admit would have limited impact.",Catalan authorities are expected to declare a drought emergency today.

2024-02-01,'Mafia' strikes set to bring Finland to a standstill,"Unions have called for industrial action to protest government proposals on labour law reforms which they say would adversely impact low-wage earners

Hundreds of thousands of workers in Finland are expected to join widespread strikes which began Wednesday and escalate through Thursday and Friday - with more strikes planned next week too.

Unions have called for industrial action to protest government proposals on labour law reforms which they say would adversely impact low-wage earners and shift a balance of power towards employers when it comes to setting salaries.

The government says their sweeping reforms are needed to make the Finnish economy more competitive, and as an indicator of how important the new proposals are to each side, the rhetoric has become more heated and divisive in recent weeks.

The strike comes right in the middle of campaigning in the second round of Finland's presidential election, with politicians from the left and right campaigning hard for votes ahead of the ballot on Sunday 11 February.

""The need to reform our social security system and increase employment is urgent because of our public debt level. We need to get more people to work, decrease public spending and improve the operating environment to attract investments,"" says Arto Satonen, Finland's Minister for Employment.

""The EU has pointed a finger at our debt-based public spending outlook and also the IMF has strongly supported the current Finnish government's policies. For the sake of our future well-being, we should not and cannot leave the reforms undone,"" he tells Euronews.

Unions estimate up to 300,000 workers could participate in the strikes, with a rally in Helsinki on Thursday afternoon bringing politicians from each side to the stage to address the expected crowds.

A strike by daycare staff in the capital city region started Wednesday, and they are now joined by workers from across the spectrum of Finnish working life, impacting: trains, trams and buses; airports, airlines and cabin crew; shipping, ferries and port operations; energy production companies; department stores and supermarket chains, hotels and restaurants; cleaning companies; tourism and leisure businesses; Finland's biggest paper mills, mines and refineries; construction companies; and postal services.

Maria Löfgren, the President of Akava which represents professional and managerial staff, tells Euronews that her union has ""sought to resolve the escalated situation by proposing balancing solutions to the Prime Minister.""

""So far, the government has not committed to taking them into account [...] we want our solution to be genuinely considered,"" she says.

Minister Satonen, from the ruling National Coalition Party, says the government has been working together with unions when preparing its reforms, but they are ""absolutely necessary"" and that unions cannot have a ""right of veto"" on the plans.

At the heart of the dispute are two main changes the government says it needs to make the Finnish economy more competitive.

First, there would be swingeing cuts to social welfare provisions, with some of those cuts already implemented. Unions say it would mean hundreds of euros lost each month for people already on low incomes - a serious issue in sectors like retail where wages are already low - and it would adversely impact women who are more likely to be employed in some of those low-wage occupations.

Secondly, the government wants to rewrite the rules on collective bargaining.

Finland traditionally used a tripartite model for labour negotiations: involving the government, representatives from trade unions, and representatives from employers too. The government's changes, unions claim, would mean the bargaining power of workers is weakened.

Unions are concerned that changes proposed to this decades-old system would be detrimental as it fragments wage negotiations and puts more power in the hands of industries or individual companies to set maximum wage increase levels, potentially leading to income disparity even among people with similar jobs.

""In the long run, this kind of change would almost surely mean lower wages and less beneficial conditions for workers,"" says Pekka Ristelä, Head of International Affairs at SAK, the Confederation of Finnish Trade Unions.

The government has also proposed a system in which pay across the economy is tied to the export sector. It would bar the national labour mediator, which is frequently involved in setting pay, from proposing wage hikes in any labour dispute that are higher than those agreed with the export sector.

The government's plans, and the unions' calls for strike action, have again pitted Finland's ruling right against the left.

Government ministers have called the unions ""mafia"", while right-wing politicians have claimed union leaders will ""punish"" workers who opt not to strike, and offered free legal advice to anyone in this situation. Another MP from a government party described the right to industrial action as a ""pointless inconvenience.""

Finland's coalition government, which includes a far-right party as the second biggest partner, has repeatedly tried to paint the strikes as dangerously political, saying they have already secured a mandate from the voters to carry out their reforms - and that unions shouldn't try to outflank them.

A citizens' initiative petition to ban so-called political strikes is supported by several politicians from the prime minister's party.

""It is dangerous if we start seeing internationally recognised, established social players as 'mafia' and using those kind of labels. I would say that can be the start of a very harmful societal development,"" says SAK's Pekka Ristelä.

""International treaties, in particular the ILO, has specific rules on what kind of political strikes must be allowed, and political strikes are directed against government policies that have an effect on workers,"" he adds, describing a worrying ""Trump effect"" where legitimate actions are called into question.

""On the whole, we have wide support in the population.""",Hundreds of thousands of workers expected to join widespread strikes in Finland.

2024-01-31,Islamophobia is surging throughout Europe. Here's how we stop it,"It's crucial for leaders and everyday people to unite in a remarkable effort to confront the pervasive hatred in our communities. It's not just minorities that are at risk, it's the Western world too, and our shared values of freedom, justice and equality, Naz Shah writes.

Earlier this month, a plot between AfD party officials and neo-Nazis to deport millions of ethnic minorities from Germany was uncovered.

But this conspiracy is part of a sinister undercurrent sweeping Europe and the wider Western world - one that goes hand-in-hand with a relentless surge in Islamophobia.

Since the atrocities of 7 October and the ongoing onslaught against the people of Gaza, Islamophobia in the UK has surged 600%.

Yet the British government has responded by inflaming rhetoric rather than promoting messages of unity.

Recently, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak used an Islamophobic trope as a response to another Muslim MP, which I was forced to call out on the floor of the Commons.

Meanwhile, the Conservative government has spent their time and effort - not healing worsening social ties or resolving the conflict in the Middle East - but forcing through the controversial Rwanda asylum plan that is the epitome of institutionalised xenophobia.

But xenophobia is becoming more than normalised in the echelons of political power - it is becoming key to winning elections across Europe, and beyond.

From Sweden to Greece, far-right groups and populist leaders are not just participating in elections; they are winning, often in record numbers.

Geert Wilders' ascent in the Netherlands, fueled by decades-worth of anti-Muslim rhetoric, including the promise to ban mosques and the Qur'an, exemplifies how Europe is faced with a political trend not towards integration and acceptance, but hate and exclusion.

And it could get a lot worse.

Should Donald Trump be elected US President this November, the Western world will have turned a new disturbing corner, where minorities become scapegoats for the ills of Western society.

For example, Trump recently said immigrants were ""poisoning the blood [of America]"" to raucous applause from crowds.

There is no doubt that his ascent to the White House would herald an even stronger far-right revival, emboldening new populists to emerge from other EU nations.

But why is this divisive rhetoric, key to electoral success, resonating with so many? The answer lies in the power of fear.

For example, the great replacement theory that so many far-right populists exhort asserts Western civilization is facing an existential threat in a culture war against Western values.

That narrative, of the West fighting for survival against an imagined onslaught of Islamization, is designed to tap into deep-seated existential fears.

And to some degree, it's working.

Europe is being pulled towards far-right ideologies at a scale reminiscent of the preludes to World War II.

It isn't just a political trend; it's a dangerous slide towards an era of division and hostility, one that will challenge the very foundations of our democratic values.

How then, do we address a trend that threatens to engulf Western Muslims, other minorities, and core Western values of empathy, tolerance, and mutual respect?

Well, for one, we must work tirelessly to humanise the other. History shows that escalating persecution and violence against minorities is always paired with their dehumanization.

This is why education must play a pivotal role. Schools must incorporate curricula that foster a better understanding of Islamic culture through exposure and knowledge of those with different backgrounds.

But education in schools must complement wider education in society.

That's why my participation in the Conference of European and British Muslim Leaders this past year was a pivotal moment for the British Muslim community.

This gathering, orchestrated by the Muslim World League in London convened hundreds of the most influential Muslim figures in Britain. At the centre of the conference was the Charter of Makkah, a sweeping bill of Islamic rights and values backed by over 1,200 scholars from 139 countries which testifies to Islam's commitment to modern ideals.

For example, the charter emphasizes environmental stewardship, religious tolerance, and women's rights.

But these values are more than abstract ideals; they are integral to the daily lives of British Muslims. Importantly, they go directly against the divisive rhetoric of far-right extremists.

This matters immensely. Recognising the shared values between British Muslims and the wider society strikes at the root of extremism. And such appreciation strengthens the fabric of our society, bolstering its resilience against divisive forces.

But resilience cannot only come from us. The media, society, and government also have important roles to play.

For example, policy interventions remain crucial. The political obsession with Islamophobia is distracting policymakers from addressing the increase in white nationalist terrorism, which has risen at least 320% in the past decade and increasingly targeting the young.

Ironically, the narratives that far-right parties are spewing against Muslims are precisely the fuel that this extremist ideology depends upon.

This is why governments should develop information campaigns about the dangers of the far-right alongside legislation that protects communities from hate crimes and hate speech.

This is particularly relevant to social media and the online world, where the far-right feels they have a free pass to spread hatred.

It is also time for the UK government to adopt the All-Party Parliamentary Group on British Muslims' definition of Islamophobia. After all, how can you tackle something you cannot define or understand?

Ultimately, it's crucial for leaders and everyday people to unite in a remarkable effort to confront the pervasive hatred in our communities.

Because it's not just minorities that are at risk, it's the Western world too, and our shared values of freedom, justice and equality.

2024-01-31,Catalan President calls for 'responsibility' to approve amnesty law,"The President of the Catalan government Pere Aragonès on Wednesday pleaded on political parties to take ""responsibility"" and approve the amnesty law in an interview with Euronews.

It comes a day after the controversial amnesty bill was unexpectedly struck down by a small margin in Spain's Congress.

The law is part of a pact struck between Spain's socialist party (PSOE) and Catalan separatists that allowed Pedro Sánchez to form a coalition government last November.

""I appeal on all parties to take responsibility so that this amnesty law is not put at risk,"" Aragonès told Euronews in Brussels, adding that he wants to see the text approved ""as soon as possible.""

His remarks are likely directed against Junts per Catalunya (Junts), the separatist party of former Catalan President Carles Puigdemont whose seven Congress members voted against the amnesty law on Tuesday. The surprise move has forced the text to return to the Congress' Justice Committee.

Junts and Aragonès' Catalan Republican Left (ERC) parties had both negotiated the bill with Sánchez's Socialists.

The text seeks to grant amnesty to all those involved in the procès, the Catalan push for independence from Spain between 2012 and 2023.

But despite having fiercely defended the law, Junts' deputies struck down the text submitted before Congress, fearing the latest draft would not ensure amnesty for its de-facto exiled leader Puigdemont.

Fierce backlash against the law - including condemnation from opposition groups and violent protests on Spain's streets - has invited international scrutiny. The European Commission is currently analysing the text, but is yet to issue its opinion on the bill's compliance with the principle of rule of law.

Junts' resistance could threaten Sánchez's government, which relies on the support of the pro-independentists to sustain its slim majority.

For Aragonès, the pact is a ""historic opportunity"" for Catalonia to ""obtain more powers,"" as Sánchez ""will have to have to rely on the support of 14 pro-independence deputies"" to guarantee the stability of his government.

But Aragonés says that his pro-independence ERC party, which previously shared power with Junts in Catalonia, is taking a more collaborative approach to the pact with Sánchez's socialists.

""I reaffirm my commitment to using all democratic political tools to move forward and to commit ourselves to a better future and to find solutions,"" he said.

One of Aragonés' objectives is to secure an independence referendum, something he says he is already negotiating with Sánchez.

Catalonia's latest attempt at secession from Spain with a referendum in 2017 was hailed illegal under Spanish law.

""Everything that previously seemed impossible is now happening,"" he said. ""Therefore, everything that they tell us is impossible can be possible in the future, if we generate the right conditions and continue in our commitment.""

When asked if he believes that Sánchez will authorise a referendum, Aragonès argues that he trusts in his party's ""strength and abilities.""

For him, negotiation is key. ""In the same way that a year ago he [Sánchez] was telling me that he did not see the amnesty as a possibility, he now tells me that the referendum is not a possibility.""

""Now amnesty is on its way. And I say to him [Sánchez] that we will obviously continue to defend the referendum on self-determination"", he added.

Catalonia has held two unilateral independence referendums, in 2014 and 2017. The consequences of the second led half of the then government, including Puigdemont, to seek exile in European countries, including Belgium.

Other political leaders were imprisoned until 2021, when they were pardoned by Sánchez's government.","Pere Aragonès: ""I appeal on all parties to take responsibility so that this amnesty law is not put at risk"" It comes a day after a surprise vote by Spain's Congress to strike down the controversial law.

2024-01-31,"Schoolchildren should learn about AI, tech insiders say","Some argue that as AI becomes a more common part of our lives, schoolchildren should learn about it.

As artificial intelligence (AI) disrupts society and becomes more present in our lives, tech insiders say it should be introduced in schools, with young people learning more about the technology.

At an annual education technology conference in London, several companies presented innovative products designed to teach children about tech and AI.

""I think AI is going to affect the world no matter what industry you go into,"" said Ben Garside, a learning manager at Raspberry Pi, a British charity set up to promote the study of computer science.

""So rather than thinking that I have to be a programmer, we want young people to think, what is it that they're interested in and actually think, well, hey how is AI going to be able to support me in that role? So we can achieve that and think what the future could look like. Get them excited about it rather than worried. That's what we're trying to do"".

The British Educational Training and Technology Show (BETT) is a show for teachers to learn about the latest technology and the benefits and challenges of incorporating it into the classroom.

The UK's latest National Curriculum was published in September 2014, but there is no specific mention of AI.

Roger Grogan, the founder of Jam Coding, believes AI is going to be ""fundamental"" for children's lives.

""We're at the very start of the AI movement. I would actually argue we're still at the very start of the digital revolution. So we've got to, as teachers in the classroom, constantly evolve what we're teaching, how we teach it,"" Grogan said.

""AI isn't specifically on the National Curriculum, but there are mentions of technology on there that could refer to AI...So it's really important that we teach them about it, how they can use it,"" he added.

Hong Kong-based 5G Nu Multimedia's robotic dog GO2 is designed to teach primary school children about AI.

It also has drones to teach students how to program formation flying drones, which can be used for light shows or during firework displays.

He believes AI education should start as young as primary school.

""For students, they should learn AI or application ASAP. So that is the meaning of this whole course, why we take the professional application and stream it down into the elementary level as early as possible, starting from primary and then secondary school,"" said Alan Chan, 5G Nu Multimedia's CEO.

Microsoft acquired Minecraft, a popular open-world game, from its Swedish developers and has been keen to promote its educational benefits.

""In the last year, we built a game called Generation AI, which teaches children about the principles and ethical uses of AI. So from a very early age, we want children to think about responsible use of AI, what are the underpinning principles,"" said Justin Edwards, the Director of Learning Experiences at Microsoft for Minecraft.

""For example, fairness. What is fairness? How do we avoid bias? Why does AI potentially have bias and how do we avoid that? And so we're starting to teach children not just how to use AI, but to think about AI use in everyday life and how they would build upon that. And we do that in a game-based way,"" Edwards added.

Dominika Gyanyi, head of education at Bookr, a Hungarian tech education company based in Budapest, believes it's important to get familiar with AI before children leave school.

""They know their advantages and also disadvantages. So it should be incorporated in our tech,"" Gyanyi said.

BETT has been running since the mid-1980s, the time when computers and technology first started to enter schools.

It attracts around 30,000 educators from around the world.","Some argue that as AI becomes more common part of our lives, schoolchildren should learn about it.

2024-01-31,Climate change kills as many people as Geneva's population a year,"Governments committed at least €8.2 trillion to fight COVID but only €132 million of climate adaptation funds are spent on health annually.

In summer 2022, sweltering heat killed an estimated 61,672 people across Europe.

Most of those who died already had existing health issues like heart and lung disease. But their deaths were not inevitable: their breathing stopped and their hearts failed in searing temperatures made 160 times more likely by climate change.

It's possible to count the climate dead in this way because of attribution science, which measures the responsibility of climate change for a particular extreme weather event.

Estimating the cumulative death toll from climate change is much harder, but one expert calculates it's on track to pass 4 million in 2024 since 2000 - a total greater than the population of Berlin.

""Vanishingly few of these deaths will have been recognized by the victims' families, or acknowledged by national governments, as the consequence of climate change,"" writes US climate epidemiologist Colin Carlson, in a commentary in the journal Nature Medicine this week.

""More than half of those deaths will have been due to either malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, or malnutrition and diarrheal disease in south Asia, and most of the dead are therefore presumed to have been young children.""

Carlson, a global change biologist and assistant professor at Georgetown University, is calling for a wholesale shift in the way we think about and respond to the climate emergency.

The evidence that climate change has caused mass death on a ""pandemic-like scale"" is already shockingly clear, he says, but the science of climate epidemiology is still languishing.

""The first, and so far, only estimate of its kind,"" claims Carlson, dates back to the early 2000s, when Australian epidemiologist Anthony McMichael developed a method to estimate mortality for certain climate risk factors.

These include floods, malnutrition, diarrhoea, malaria and cardiovascular disease, and the total number of deaths attributable to climate change came out as 166,000 a year. Taking that estimate forward, Carlson says that the climate crisis is annually killing nearly as many people as the population of Geneva.

4 million deaths by 2024 is well on the conservative side, since the McMichael method doesn't include a number of other climate-related threats that experts have gained a more acute understanding of in recent years. Global heating has also caused excess mortality through famines, conflict, suicides, wildfires and dozens of chronic and infectious diseases like dengue fever.

Excluding the COVID-19 pandemic - which claimed seven million lives - climate change has exceeded the combined death toll of every World Health Organisation (WHO)-recognised public health emergency of international concern, Carlson notes.

But while the rising curves of COVID were closely watched on both a national and international scale, climate change is often described as a more generalised miasma we can't hope to quantify in health and death terms.

Would treating climate as an analogous public health emergency help to cut through to the public and policymakers? Carlson certainly thinks so; and so do many others in the health and epidemiology space.

""If we're not looking at the underlying cause, and we're just treating the symptoms, we're just going to keep falling further and further behind,"" said Dr Kyle Merritt, the first doctor to put 'climate change' on a woman's death certificate after an extreme heatwave in Canada in 2021.

The UN climate conference held its first 'health day' at COP28 in December, where more than 40 million health professionals demanded combined health and climate action.

But, writes Carlson, ""No matter how many governments and international organisations pay lip service to climate change as a health emergency, their spending tells the real story.""

Global governments committed at least $9 trillion (€8.2 trillion) to fight COVID, he adds, but only $143 million (€132 million) of climate adaptation funds worldwide are spent on health each year.

Posting his commentary on X yesterday, Carlson said he wrote it ""because I felt like I was the only one who had noticed.""

""Cutting greenhouse gasses isn't enough anymore,"" he added. ""National governments have to meet the challenge of climate and health with substantive commitments: access to essential medicines; access to high-quality care; access to food and clean water.""

To advance the study of climate mortality, Carlson - who also runs an institute focused on predicting and preventing pandemics - thinks that predictive computer modelling is the way forward.

To that end, he told Grist magazine, he is planning to gather leading climate and health experts together this year, to figure out how to build a predictive system that can simulate disease spread and climate conditions.

As for WHO's approach, the UN agency has been calling climate change and air pollution a global crisis for years. Between 2030 and 2050, it warns, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress alone.

However the terminology of Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) is very technical and has certain criteria, such as acute, unusual occurrence and risk of global spread. Since the climate crisis has been ongoing for decades and is already a chronic global crisis, these technical descriptions do not apply, according to WHO.

The chronic global climate crisis demands a sustained, long-term approach for our health, which it says a PHEIC declaration was not designed for.

That doesn't change the fact that we need to prepare health systems around the world to adapt and be more climate resilient and we need to reduce emissions dramatically, now.","In summer 2022, sweltering heat killed an estimated 61,672 people across Europe.

2024-01-31,Report casts doubt on member states' climate plans as 2040 target loom,"New assessment questions EU countries' ability to deliver climate goals.

Five EU countries' climate and energy national plans lack detail and are inconsistent, jeopardising their chances of hitting 2030 emissions targets and raising the stakes for governments ahead of a looming 2040 climate target, according to an climate NGO report published today (January 31).

Draft national plans of Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden all reveal ""major planning issues"" in crucial sectors for the energy transition such as hydrogen, land use, bioenergy and carbon storage, according to the report by the European Climate Neutrality Network (ECNO).

While Sweden's national strategy implies the country is on track to reach net negative emissions by 2030, ECNO's experts ""do not deem it credible"" arguing the country relies on old data and ""low-quality planning"". As for Hungary, current plans point to a possible increase in greenhouse gas emissions and its draft plans ""ambiguously"" refer to ""low-carbon"" hydrogen as opposed to green hydrogen, reads the report.

In the Netherlands, by 2030, renewable hydrogen production is expected to meet around 30% to 40% of the country's electricity demand, the report states, noting the country would use its renewable resources ""with much lower efficiency"", instead of using it ""directly as electricity"".

Italy's draft plans show ""heavy reliance on carbon capture storage (CCS) in the industrial sector"" and lack any reference to alternative decarbonisation measures, according to the report, while Spain didn't disclose details about long-term carbon sinking, risking inconsistencies and reliance on fossil fuels.

""Getting onto a climate-neutral pathway in this critical decade of action requires much more coherent and integrated cross-sectoral planning for the near term,"" said Julien Pestiaux, lead author of the report and a partner at Climact, a consultancy and one of ECNO's consortium partners.

Pestiaux warned EU countries to avoid overreliance on bioenergy to prevent ""land grabs and deforestation around the world"", to carefully consider their demand for green hydrogen, and to make a clear distinction between carbon capture utilisation and carbon capture storage.

ECNO called on countries to ""urgently up their games"" when charting out national plans, an appeal echoed by the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (ESABCC), which said ""more efforts are needed across all sectors"" to reach the EU climate goals from 2030 to 2050.

The Commission is set to announce the new intermediary target 2040 climate target next week (February 6).

A leaked draft of the communication circulated in Brussels last week suggests the Commission intends to back a 90% reduction on net emissions compared to 1990, the lower end of a five-point range recommended by the EU's independent scientific advisory board.

Member states have until June to present their energy and climate plans. The five countries did not respond immediately to the ECNO report.

Pestiaux welcomed the EU executive's reported upcoming proposal for the 2040 climate target but maintained that ""the robustness of the [national] plans will ultimately determine the successful delivery of the ambition"".","Five EU countries' climate and energy national plans lack detail and are inconsistent.

2024-01-31,EU naval mission to protect ships in Red Sea set to launch in 3 weeks,"""Maritime security in the Red Sea has significantly deteriorated over the last weeks and we are very much advancing the work of a new maritime operation in order to act in a purely defensive mode to protect merchant vessels,"" Josep Borrell confirmed after an informal meeting of defence ministers in Brussels.

""Our goal is to establish and launch this mission, Aspides, at the latest on the 19 February, I hope, and I'm sure, we will,"" he added. Foreign affairs ministers from across the bloc are scheduled to meet in the Belgian capital on that date and stamp the plan with their approval.

Iran-backed Houthis rebels in Yemen have launched missile and drone attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea since the start of Israel's offensive against the Gaza Strip following deadly attacks by the Hamas militant group against Israel on 7 October.

The Red Sea is a crucial trading route through which an estimated 12% of global trade including 30% of global container traffic passes.

The attacks have forced some major shipping companies to avoid the area in favour of longer, and therefore costlier, routes which have led to shipping delays and already forced some factories in Europe to temporarily halt production.

This, in turn, has raised fears that inflation, which in Western economies has been on a downward trend in recent months, could start climbing again and leave a more lasting impact on the economy.

So far only five member states have publicly indicated they will participate in the mission: Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy.

Details that still need to be ironed out before 19 February include what military personnel and capabilities will be committed to the mission, which country will lead it and where the headquarters will be located.

Euronews understands France, Greece and Italy have pitched for the leadership role.

In the case of Belgium and Germany, the decision to join the mission will have to be ratified by lawmakers but officials from both countries appeared confident this could take place quickly.

""We are expecting the Council decision by February 19, which we can then follow up with the accelerated German referral to the Bundestag,"" Siemtje Möller, Germany's state secretary for defence, told reporters before Wednesday's meeting.

""If the Bundestag agrees, the German navy will also participate. The navy is already in the process of preparing for this mandate or possible participation,"" she added.

Belgian Defence Minister Ludivine Debonder meanwhile said that its Louise-Marie frigate, which is already in the region, would likely be part of the mission.

The EU mission will be strictly restricted to protecting ships and intercepting incoming missiles in contrast to the US and UK which have together bombed multiple Houthis targets on two separate occasions as part of Operation Prosperity Guardian.

Borrell stressed that the capabilities involved in Aspides will be ""proportionate to the threat we are facing"" and that ""we will not conduct any operation on land, only on sea.""

""Of course, we will coordinate with other missions,"" he added, referring to the US-led operation.",Foreign affairs ministers from across the bloc are scheduled to meet in Brussels.

Thousands have replied to the red felt puppet's post (which has been read upwards of 172 million times), and it's a veritable deluge of venting, angst and trauma dumping that has probably taken the children's show character by surprise.

The reaction to the innocent wellness check has certainly cast him as the world's de facto therapist.

""Every morning, I cannot wait to go back to sleep. Every Monday, I cannot wait for Friday to come,"" a user wrote. ""Every single day and every single week for life.""

""Elmo I'm suffering from existential dread over here,"" another replied.

Collective breakdown continued, and celebrities joined in.

Actress Rachel Zegler said she was ""resisting the urge to tell Elmo that I am kinda sad"".

""We've been better, Elmo,"" wrote the Detroit Free Press, in response to the Detroit Lions falling to the San Francisco 49ers. (That's American Football, in case you were wondering.)

Bleak. But he did sign off with the following line: ""however I did have a good grapefruit earlier, thank you for asking""

Legend.

It was all very overwhelming, so Elmo replied: ""Wow! Elmo is glad he asked! Elmo learned that it is important to ask a friend how they are doing. Elmo will check in again soon, friends! Elmo loves you. #EmotionalWellBeing""

US President Joe Biden agreed, posting: ""I know how hard it is some days to sweep the clouds away and get to sunnier days. Our friend Elmo is right: We have to be there for each other, offer our help to a neighbor in need, and above all else, ask for help when we need it. Even though it's hard, you're never alone.""

Sesame Street's official X account even shared a link to mental health resources.

The show has addressed the mental health of children and their families in videos, podcasts and courses in the past through its Sesame Workshop, especially as suicide has become a leading cause of death among people aged 10-14.

""Thank you, @Elmo, for checking in with a reminder for us to pause and take a mindful moment to focus on how we're feeling,"" Sesame Street's official account wrote. ""For #EmotionalWellbeing resources and more, visit @SesameWorkshop: http://sesame.org/mentalhealth.""

2024-01-31,How is the French government trying to calm farmers' protests?,"Unfair competition from imports and fair pay are two of the issues farmers are protesting over.

Convoys of tractors are edging closer to Paris, Lyon and other major French cities with police arresting 18 people just outside the capital city on Wednesday. Last week, a woman and her teenage daughter died in southern France after a car hit a roadblock where they were standing.

Tensions are rapidly rising and the president of France's biggest farming union FNSEA, Arnaud Rosseau, called for ""calm and reason"" in the face of growing anger. He acknowledged that many European issues cannot be ""resolved in three days.""

France has scrambled to offer concessions with new Prime Minister Gabriel Attal saying on Tuesday that he was ready to solve the crisis.

But despite officials meeting with farmers, protests are spreading across Europe.

Prime Minister Attal told lawmakers at France's National Assembly on Tuesday that he was ready to resolve the crisis, adding that ""there is and there must be a French agricultural exception"".

He said he would put in place controls on imported food that would ensure ""fair competition"". Especially, he added, when it comes to regulations being applied equally to both French farmers and imported products.

One of the farmers' key grievances has been a trade deal between the EU and Mercosur - a South American bloc which is made up of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay. They worry that they won't be able to compete with cheap imports of agricultural goods that don't have to conform to the same regulatory standards.

The trade deal has been in talks for more than two decades and an agreement was announced in 2019. But it was never implemented due to new environmental demands from the EU including assurances on deforestation and climate change.

France has long been opposed to the deal with President Emmanuel Macron saying in the past that he can't impose environmental regulations on farmers within France while imports of agricultural goods from elsewhere don't have to uphold the same standards.

Environmental groups too have opposed the deal calling into question the climate impact of importing more products like beef from the Mercosur bloc.

The French government said on Tuesday that EU talks with Mercosur have now stopped after President Emmanuel Macron convinced them to bury the deal. It claims that the Commission recognised that it was impossible to conclude them in current circumstances.

The Commission, however, says that negotiations are still in progress.

Prime Minister Attal addressed concerns about fair pay too, saying a law meant to ensure farmers receive their fair share of profits from retailers will be better enforced. Checks are now being carried out and retailers who aren't following the rules will be fined, starting immediately. The Prime Minister also promised emergency aid for struggling wine producers.

A cut in taxes on agricultural fuel used in tractors and other farm machinery and pledges to cut environmental red tape were already offered last week to appease France's farmers.

Despite this, protesters continue to move closer to major cities like Paris and Lyon, blocking roads and causing heavy traffic jams. Many, including FNSEA, remain sceptical about the government's ability to address their demands.

Farmers have just won their first concession from the EU as rules on setting aside land to restore soil and increase biodiversity are set to be delayed.

These rules mean farmers would have to leave between 4 and 7 per cent of land unused or fallow so that nature can recover as a requirement for receiving EU subsidies.

A new proposal from the European Commission on Wednesday has now recommended a delay in introducing these rules on fallow land until 2025.

""The commission's proposal, sent today to member states who will vote on it in a committee meeting, provides a first concrete policy response to address farmers' income concerns,"" it said in a statement.

""It also follows requests outlined by several member states in agriculture council meetings.""

Maroš Šefčovič, European Commission executive vice president responsible for the European Green Deal, said the decision to delay the rules was taken as farmers had had an exceptionally hard year due to climate change and extreme weather.

""I met with the president of Andalusia, he was telling me that the water reservoirs are at 20 per cent level or in some parts of Andalusia 4 per cent,"" he told a press briefing.

""What kind of dramatic changes does that require to sustain the agriculture and economic model? What kind of percentages are lost in the GDP?""

Farmers in Greece, he said, had lost more than 20 per cent of their annual revenue due to fires and floods.","Farmers are protesting over unfair competition from imports and fair pay.

2024-01-31,Novartis doctor on Big Pharma's battle against climate change,"If the healthcare industry was a country, it would be the fifth largest polluter on Earth.

""Hospitals are very significant polluters, despite the great benefits that we all enjoy when we fall sick,"" says Novartis President.

By 2050, 70% of the world's population is expected to live in cities - that equates to 2.5 billion more than today.

By then, the global temperature is likely to be at least 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer, with some sources suggesting it could be 3 degrees, depending on how drastically the world reacts.

Rising temperatures cause additional stress to the human body, but that's not the only risk to our health.

As the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries battle to stay on top of the problem - are the emissions they produce just perpetuating the problem?

In the latest episode of The Big Question, Hannah Brown spoke to Dr Lutz Hegemann, the President of Global Health and Sustainability at Novartis.

""Global warming predominantly will manifest itself with the rise and spread of vector-borne diseases that will attack patient populations that for many, many years have not lived with a disease like that,"" says Dr Hegemann.

Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) refers to a group of around 20 diseases, including dengue fever and leprosy, which put a strain on global health but do not receive the funding or research needed to help tackle them - often because they're no longer a problem in developed countries.

However, as the earth gets warmer and extreme weather events become more prevalent, the conditions for the vectors that carry these diseases, such as mosquitoes, are becoming more favourable.

""Flooding, for instance - stagnant water is an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes,"" Dr Hegemann offers as an example.

Without funding and medical intervention, Dr Hegemann fears these NTDs could become commonplace in all corners of the world and put a much greater strain on our healthcare infrastructure.

""We have to stop the neglect of neglected tropical diseases because they will rise in importance.""

According to Dr Hegemann, the healthcare industry contributes about 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. That includes hospitals which, despite their importance, are huge polluters.

Some 5% of global emissions is the equivalent of 514 coal-fired power plants. If the healthcare industry was a country, it would be the fifth largest polluter on Earth.

According to a study by theconversation.com in 2019, for every $1 million (€0.92 million) it generated, the pharmaceutical industry produced 48.55 tonnes of CO2 equivalent. That's 55% more than the automotive industry, which emitted 31.4 tonnes per $1m generated in the same year.

The pharmaceutical industry also relies heavily on water.

""Water quality matters a lot because we need pure water to manufacture high quality medicines,"" Dr Hegemann explains.

However, there is some concern over pharmaceutical chemicals making their way into our water sources, either through the improper disposal of medicines and chemicals, through poor municipal sewage management (entering the system through patient excrement) or from manufacturing waste water.

Many of us, when we think of ""Big Pharma"", picture evil men in suits rolling in money trying to monopolise the market while the poorest in society struggle to gain access to the treatment they need. It's not exactly a complementary image.

But is that a true and accurate depiction of the industry?

""The industry has not always acted in a way that would foster trust with the larger communities, but I think that has, to a large extent, changed,"" says Dr Hegemann, a former public health physician.

At the Kigali Commonwealth Conference in 2022, Novartis, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical corporations, made a commitment to invest $250 million (€230.7 million) over a five-year period into researching and developing medicines for diseases where absolutely no market exists.

""I still believe that, as a responsible company, we have to do it because it's part of our mandate,"" Lutz adds.

""We've taken the decision to take this whole region out of our core business, and have a business that's almost run like a social business where we reinvest all the profits that we made into health system strengthening.""

That doesn't mean the industry is perfect by any means.

In October 2023, the European Commission fined Alkaloids of Australia, Alkaloids Corporation, Boehringer, Linnea and Transo-Pharm €13.4 million (€12.4 million) for working together as a cartel to fix the minimum sales price of an pharmaceutical ingredient called SNBB.

In March 2023, Europe's largest company, Novo Nordisk was suspended from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry for two years for violating rules and sponsoring a ""disguised"" large-scale promotional campaign.

In 2020, the US state of Washington sued Johnson & Johnson for its role in making the prescription of opioids more widespread, and for deceiving doctors and the public about the risk of addiction.

In late 2017, Novartis was under investigation in Greece for bribing state officials and doctors to gain preferential treatment in the market.

So, while in some areas, the pharmaceutical industry is making great strides, there's still some room for improvement when it comes to business ethics.

Dr Hegemann notes that it's important not to forget the ""tremendous strides"" that have been made in containing disease over the past 20 years.

""We halved childhood mortality in sub Saharan Africa.

""HIV, Aids, when I was still practising as a physician was a death sentence, has become now a well manageable almost chronic disease,"" he adds.

""But then those are being threatened now by the climate change and the consequences that it has, particularly on the infectious disease.""

However, Lutz insists climate change isn't the only threat and says that geopolitical activity can also have a huge effect on disease and access to healthcare.

""I think what's critically important is that we build resilient health systems, and that's predominantly investing into the primary health care, bringing the health care to the patient rather than the patient to the healthcare system.""

But it's also not just down to the private sector. Dr Hegemann believes public and private partnerships are the key to improving global health and that more effort needs to be made to help people get diagnoses because, without that, what is the point in increasing efficacy and access to medicine?

Dr Hegemann also stresses the importance of changing the way we address healthcare.

""The health care system in many parts of the world, has been set up so you essentially care for those who have fallen sick.

""And I think we need to change that to look much more into measures to prevent disease from happening in the first place.

""That shift is not easy because, very often, the money is found by looking after the sick [...] but I believe that's the shift that, ultimately, you need to make and if we can deploy our resources in the most efficient way then, of course, that's going to help make that change.""

2024-01-31,Commission lowers green sights for agriculture amid farmers' protests,"The EU executive assists French President Emmanuel Macron proposing a partial derogation to the green architecture for farming subsidies - a key demand of farmers causing unrest in France.

The European Commission today (31 January) proposed loosening green farming requirements under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) while maintaining the full level of payments for farmers, answering French farmers' concerns that the rules lead to income losses.

""By taking this stabilising action, we can help alleviate the pressure that we know our farmers are feeling to ensure that they can stay economically viable during these times of high uncertainty,"" said Commission Executive Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič presenting the initiative.

Since 2023, EU farmers have been required to devote 4% of their land to biodiversity and landscape protection such as hedgerows and fallow meadows if they want to access EU farming subsidies.

The commission already fully suspended the implementation of the fallow land requirement in 2023 in the wake of market disruptions caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

This new exemption will be limited to this year and partial, since it would allow farmers to grow nitrogen-fixing crops such as lentils and peas in areas that should remain fallow while remaining eligible for direct payments.

Farmers could also decide to plant other fast-growing crops between successive plantings - which are known as catch crops - so long as these are grown without the use of pesticides in a bid to maintain the environmental ambition of the CAP.

""We remain committed to improving biodiversity and investing in soil health because nature is a buffer against natural disasters and because nature matters to health, jobs and the entire economy,"" said Šefčovič.

The proposed derogation needs now to be discussed by member states and, once approved, could be applied retroactively as of January 2024.

Why now?

Since August, the bloc's agriculture ministers have discussed the possibility of extending last year's exemption to 2024, but the EU executive has resisted these efforts, arguing that further derogation would be legally impracticable.

The sudden change of mind at the commission followed farmers' protests across Europe. ""We, in this building have the highest respect for everybody who puts forward an argument on policy,"" said Commission Vice-President Margaritis Schinas, noting that the lion's share of the EU budget goes to agriculture.

""Farmers have no better ally in safeguarding their income than the European Commission,"" he added.

A key trigger for the development was recent data showing average values for cereal production and farmers' income decreasing in 2023 compared to 2022, according to an EU official.

No stakeholders were consulted before the commission presented the proposal, the official said, adding that ""this is something that has been strongly supported"".

The commission expected the exemption to relieve pressure on the farmers' income rather than increase agricultural output, the EU official continued.

The proposed exemption swiftly garnered positive feedback including from Belgium's Prime Minister Alexander De Croo who dubbed the postponement of the fallow land requirement ""a first important step for our farmers"", calling on fewer administrative burdens imposed by Europe.

For the EU farmers lobby Copa-Cogeca, the decision came late in the agricultural calendar and remains limited. ""We hope that Member States will further strengthen this proposal to have a more global approach, especially in countries that have been particularly impacted by extreme climate events, during the European Council meeting tomorrow (1 February),"" a Copa-Cogeca spokesperson said in a statement.

Ariel Brunner from the NGO Birdlife Europe labelled the decision ""shameful"", and said it served the interests of the chemical industry and anti-environment ideology.

""Allowing ecological destruction to try and squeeze a bit of extra production from dying land is ecologically irresponsible,"" he told Euronews.

According to Brunner, last year's measure failed to have any positive impact, as farmers' production is heavily impacted by climate disruption and land dedicated to biodiversity remains marginal.","French President Emmanuel Macron proposes a partial derogation to the green architecture for farming subsidies.

2024-01-31,Cooling inflation in France and Germany raises hopes for ECB cuts,"Europe's two biggest economies seem to be winning the battle against the inflationary beast, but is it still too early for rate cuts?

France and Germany have published their latest consumer price index (CPI) data and the results are promising.

CPI is a measure of inflation which looks at how much money consumers are paying for particular goods and services over time.

France was the first to share the news, with national statistics agency INSEE reporting a 0.2% drop in prices month-to-month, and a 3.1% annual rise in inflation for January.

This is down from a 3.7% year-on-year jump seen in December, meaning that while prices are still climbing, they are doing so at a slower pace.

The annual cool-down can be explained by looking at the easing costs of food, energy, and manufactured goods, while monthly changes were strongly driven by falling costs of manufactured products such as clothing and footwear.

Turning to German data, January's CPI came in at 2.9%, compared with the same month a year earlier.

This is the lowest point this figure has reached since June 2021, a sliver of good news for Germany, described by some as the current ""sick man of Europe"".

To break this down, January's energy prices fell 2.8% year-on-year, while food prices rose 3.8% compared with the same period last year.

Both countries also reported a harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP), which is an adjusted measure of inflation that can be compared across countries.

Germany's HICP was up 3.1% year-on-year and showed a 0.2% monthly fall.

France's harmonised figure showed a 3.4% yearly increase and a 0.2% decline over the month.

Andrew Kenningham, Chief Economist at Capital Economics, said there ""were no major surprises in the national data published for France"", but added that German data surpassed expectations.

""Germany's headline HICP inflation rate dropped from 3.8% in December to 3.1% in January which was well below the consensus and our own forecasts (3.4% and 3.6% respectively).""

He went on: ""There's still one more inflation release to take into account before the ECB's March meeting, but the numbers for January make us more confident in our forecast that the first rate cut will be in April.""

Recent comments made by European financiers are also spurring on markets eager for a cut to borrowing costs.

ECB President Christine Lagarde said last week that ""the disinflation process is at work"", and Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel remarked on Tuesday of this week that the ECB had ""tamed the greedy beast"" of inflation.

The comments came as gross domestic product (GDP) data for the eurozone was released on Tuesday, showing that the area is stagnating under high interest rates.

If the ECB moves to cut borrowing costs, this could provide a much needed boost to euro nations, although the fear of rekindling inflationary fires hangs over policy makers.

The bank will be closely monitoring wider eurozone inflation data, due to be published on Thursday, as analysts now predict rate cuts in April.","France and Germany have published their latest consumer price index (CPI) data.

2024-01-31,Ukraine moves on Hungarian minority rights to placate Viktor Orbán,"Viktor Orbán remains lukewarm about improved legal protections for Hungarians in Ukraine, and is still citing the issue as a pretext for holding up military aid.

Under the watchful eye of their teacher, a group of students in western Ukraine used a scalpel and forceps to dissect a pig's heart during a weekend biology class.

The lesson was taking place in Hungarian, and the students, members of a sizeable ethnic Hungarian minority, have become a bone of contention in relations between Hungary and Ukraine - one that threatens to thwart key financial support for Kyiv as it fights to defeat Russia's invasion.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has long alleged that Ukraine's government is infringing upon the rights of those students, and of the roughly 75,000 ethnic Hungarians residing in the Ukrainian region of Zakarpattia, to speak their native language in education and public administration.

His government has blocked crucial European Union funding for Ukraine and threatened to impede the war-ravaged country's efforts toward eventually joining the bloc, bringing diplomatic ties to new lows.

The dispute over language is rooted in Ukraine's efforts to bolster its national identity after Russia-backed rebels took control of two regions in the country's east in 2014 and Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula.

Aimed at combating Russian influence, but ultimately affecting other minority languages, a law was passed in 2017 that made Ukrainian the required language of study past the fifth grade, angering Romanian, Bulgarian and Hungarian minorities.

In December, though, Ukraine amended its education and language laws to comply with the EU's membership requirements, and restored many of the language rights demanded by Budapest - prompting a sigh of relief from the region's Hungarian community.

The legislative changes ""essentially gave the Hungarian community of Zakarpattia the opportunity to ensure its own existence for another 30 years,"" said László Zubánics, head of the Hungarian Democratic Alliance of Ukraine, a Hungarian interest group.

Yet Hungary's government has indicated it is not fully satisfied with the changes - a potentially crucial sticking point as EU leaders meet on Thursday to try to break Orbán's veto of a €50 billion aid package earmarked for Kyiv.

""The law adopted at the end of last year in Ukraine undoubtedly deserves respect. It stopped a negative spiral,"" said Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó on Monday, following a bilateral meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart in western Ukraine.

He added, ""We don't see at all that the issue of national minorities has reached resolution... We still have a long way to go.""

Since Russia's invasion, Orbán, widely considered to be Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest EU ally, has emerged as a consistent opponent of military and financial aid to Kyiv and sanctions against Moscow, often using the Hungarian minority to justify his lukewarm support for Ukraine.

Hungarians in Zakarpattia are largely supportive of Orbán, but also back Kyiv's ambitions to join the EU. Yet Orbán has expressed skepticism, commenting in November that EU admission was ""light years away"" and signalling that full language rights for Ukraine's Hungarians are a prerequisite for his support.

Zubánics, who endorsed an open letter to Orbán in December urging him to lift his opposition to Ukraine's EU path, said he is optimistic, despite the tension between Budapest and Kyiv.

""In our mentality and culture, we consider ourselves European citizens,"" he said. ""We are aware that this will not happen immediately, as it will be a long, sometimes instructive and sometimes painful process for everyone.""

Hungary has provided generous financial support for the minority in Ukraine, seeking to bolster its Hungarian identity and connection to Budapest. It has simplified the procedure for acquiring Hungarian citizenship - something Ukraine, which does not recognise dual citizenship, has opposed.

The meeting on Monday between Szijjártó and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba - their first since the war began in February 2022 - as well as plans for Orbán to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, suggest a partial thaw.

But for now, Hungary's government has remained firm that despite improving conditions for the Hungarians of Zakarpattia, it is not yet ready to fully support Ukraine. That, Zubánics said, will require greater efforts from both sides.

""Diplomacy is partly high art, but at times it is more like theatre than real life,"" he said. ""But regardless of this, we have to move along with specifics now, and I think there is much more in common between the parties than what separates them, but this also requires political will.""","Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has alleged that Ukraine's government is infringing on the rights of Hungarians in Ukraine.

2024-01-31,The cruise industry is charting a more sustainable future - here's how,"Cruise companies are pursuing more efficient ships, alternative fuels and digital technologies, as they navigate towards net-zero carbon cruising by 2050.

In this edition of Focus, reporter Damon Embling visits the Italian coastal city of Genoa, to find out how the cruise industry is mapping the sustainability course ahead.

Mario Zanetti, President of Genoa-based Costa Cruises, tells Damon about the challenges facing the industry as it targets net zero, including the role of the sector in helping to scale up alternatives to traditional marine fuels.

Last year, the MSC Euribia cruise ship completed what's described as the industry's first net-zero greenhouse gas emissions voyage. As many as 400 tonnes of bio-liquefied natural gas were bought in for the symbolic journey.

Damon also visits a laboratory run by the technology company Ecospray and the University of Genoa, where researchers are working on industrialising fuel cells, which could capture up to 90% of a cruise ship's carbon emissions.

We hear from Marie-Caroline Laurent, director general in Europe for the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), who highlights the importance of shoreside electricity being installed for cruise ships to plug into. It enables vessels to cut their engines and their emissions while in port.

Dropping into Brussels, we look at the EU's efforts to drive down emissions across the maritime sector. These include an Emissions Trading System (ETS) - a scheme that puts a price on carbon emissions - and the FuelEU maritime initiative, which aims to gradually reduce dependence on traditional fuels from 2025 onwards.",The MSC Euribia completed what's described as the industry's first net-zero greenhouse gas emissions voyage last year.

He took thousands of shots along his travels and today many of them are on show in in a new exhibition at the Robert Capa Centre in Budapest.

Kereki's collection consists of 7,000 exposed negatives. Every photograph on display is intriguing, evokes memories, and in some cases people have recognised themselves or a relative.

Kereki put down his camera in the early eighties and uploaded some 1,800 images to a digital photo archive named Fortepan in 2021. Many visitors will recognise the 6th and 7th districts, where he captured everyday moments.

Describing his work and the situations he encountered, Kereki says, ""the street is the street. You find something interesting, and then you go home and look at it and it turns out it's not that interesting. So there was no plan, the only plan was that I tried not to interfere.""

""I have never done it in such a touching way, I was lucky, the lighting was good, I ran into it and I was lucky to see it, because it happened on the street, but you don't see something like that everywhere.""

2024-01-31,UK homebuying struggle: Deposits hit 105% of average annual income,"The price of an average house in the UK increased further in January, at the swiftest rate since October, according to mortgage provider Nationwide.

British house prices climbed by 0.7% month on month in January, with a yearly decline of just 0.2%, according to the latest figures from mortgage lender Nationwide Building Society.

""UK house prices rose by 0.7% in January, after taking account of seasonal effects. This resulted in an improvement in the annual rate of house price growth from -1.8% in December to -0.2% in January, the strongest out-turn since January 2023,"" Nationwide chief economist Robert Gardner said commenting on the figures.

According to Gardner, the trajectory of mortgage rates is crucial for the housing market, presenting a challenge in 2023 for individuals looking to buy a house.

""If average mortgage rates were to trend down to 4%, this would ease the mortgage payments burden to 34% of take-home pay (assuming house prices and earnings are unchanged),"" he said.

""However, other things equal, mortgage rates of 3% (still well above the lows seen in the wake of the pandemic) would be needed to bring this measure of affordability back towards its long run average.""

The current average house price remains £16,000 (€19,000) below its peak of £273,750 (€320,400) recorded in August 2022, a period marked by the impact of rising interest rates on the property market.

However, prices continue to stand approximately £42,000 (€49,000) higher than those observed in January 2020, mirroring the rapid expansion during the pandemic when record-low interest rates increased demand, as reported by the Financial Times.

Saving for a deposit remains a significant challenge for homebuyers, Nationwide said. It estimates that a 20% deposit for a typical first-time buyer's home now equals approximately 105% of the average annual gross income.

Similarly, people searching for rental properties are facing higher prices because of a high level of competition.

In the last quarter of 2023, the average advertised rents outside London in the UK reached £1,280 (€1,500) per month, marking a 9.2% increase compared with the previous year. This, reported property site Rightmove, represented the lowest annual growth rate observed since 2021.

In England, those with a median household income are spending around 26% on median-priced rented homes. In Wales, it is 23% and, in Northern Ireland, the figure is 25%.

Rightmove's forecasts for next year suggest a 5% increase in average rents outside London and 3% within the capital.","British house prices rise by 0.7% month on month in January, according to mortgage lender Nationwide.

2024-01-31,Lawmakers back fix absent deal to block child sexual abuse material online,"The European Parliament today voted in favour of extending a temporary solution to combat child sexual abuse material online, as a deal on proposed legislation will unlikely be reached before the end of the mandate of this European Commission.

Lawmakers of the parliament's Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Committee, with a majority of 49 of 66 members, agreed to give the greenlight to start discussions with the 27 EU member states in order to keep temporary rules in place.

The committee's position needs to be endorsed by the parliament as a whole before negotiations with EU countries can start, this could happen as early as 12 February.

The vote comes as EU negotiations on rules to combat online child sexual abuse (CSAM), presented in May 2022 by the European Commission, are in deadlock. Under the proposal, online platforms and service providers would face clear obligations to detect, report and remove access to such material. It also includes specific prevention, prosecution and protection responsibilities for national authorities in the member states.

The EU institutions did not manage to agree on a common stance so far; in particular the commission's plan for detection orders that oblige digital messaging services to deploy client-side scanning technology to tap into users' encrypted messages, faces resistance.

The parliament recently adopted its position on CSAM, acknowledging that scanning technologies are not compatible with the aim of having confidential and secure communications.

Lawmakers are supported by most privacy organisations who claim that even if this mechanism is created with the purpose of fighting crime online, it would also quickly be used by criminals themselves, putting citizens and businesses more at risk online by and increasing vulnerabilities for all users.

In a joint call last week, more than 53 signatories, including tech lobby group DOT Europe and child advocacy organisation 5RightsFoundation, backed the commission's proposal to extend the current e-Privacy rules. ""If a permanent solution isn't in place by 2027, we believe extending the temporary framework for at least two more years is crucial,"" the letter said.

The e-Privacy derogations, which currently ensure child safety online and mean that companies can voluntarily scan their services, will expire on 3 August of this year. The parliament calls for a one-off extension until May 2025, whereas the member states want the rules to last another three years.

Birgit Sippel, a German lawmaker in charge of leading the file through the parliament, said that today's vote means ""a vote on measures that should have never been prolonged"" in absence of a CSAM deal. ""We need a short deadline for the council to adopt a position and to avoid a situation where they can take up to three years to take a stance,"" she added.",the European Parliament votes in favour of extending a temporary solution to combat child sexual abuse material online. the vote comes as EU negotiations on rules to combat online child abuse (CSAM) are in deadlock.,"[('parliament', 0.3052), ('abuse', 0.3042), ('csam', 0.2932), ('eu', 0.2811), ('solution', 0.239), ('votes', 0.2356), ('vote', 0.2338), ('child', 0.2329), ('extending', 0.2178), ('temporary', 0.2129)]","parliament, abuse, csam, eu, solution, votes, vote, child, extending, temporary",-1
2024-01-31,What is Biden's 'Taylor Swift Plan' - and why is MAGA on the warpath?,"Are they never, ever, ever getting back together? Or should Republicans be worried?

Whatever Taylor Swift does, be it the success of the Eras Tour, her relationship or her appearances at NFL games, it's headline news. We here at Euronews Culture are guilty like the rest of them (whilst humming 'Cruel Summer' for the 17th time today).

And the discourse is increasingly zeroing in on her politics.

After breaking her years of political silence in 2018 to back Democrat candidates in the US midterm elections and endorsing President Biden in 2020 through a video message on her Instagram, the Biden administration is reportedly seeking another Taylor Swift endorsement - one which could prove crucial.

How has it come to this?

Well, quite aside from being one of the world's biggest superstars and a business savvy artist, when Taylor speaks, her fans listen. And that goes for politics too.

For instance, in September last year, the singer posted a short message on Instagram encouraging her 272 million followers to register to vote. Afterward, the website she directed her fans to - the nonpartisan nonprofit Vote.org - reported a 1,226% jump in participation in the hour after the post. The number of 18-year-olds registered was more than double 2022's figures.

And it's not just the US - this year, Brussels has asked Swift to mobilise young voters ahead of the elections to the European Parliament.

Considering this year's US presidential election is looking like it's going to give everyone a nightmarish case of déjà-vu, with a Biden-Trump face off that will melt our collective faces and tighten quite a few sphincters, the backing of someone like Swift could prove instrumental for Democrats. And when taking into account Biden's approval rating at the moment (54.8 % disapproval as of 30 January, according to American opinion poll, analysis and politics website 538), the current president's second term is far from a done deal.

Could the pop sensation give him the boost he so desperately needs?

California Governor Gavin Newsom certainly thinks so.

Newsom has made public appeals for Swift to promote the Democrats, saying that Swift's influence will have ""a profoundly powerful impact on the 2024 US presidential election.""

""What she was able to accomplish just in getting young people activated to consider that they have a voice and that they should have a choice in the next election, I think, is profoundly powerful,"" he told TMZ.

And Conservatives think so too. Clearly, otherwise they wouldn't be scrambling to discredit, blast, even threaten the pop star.

According to Rolling Stone, Republican and Conservative media figures have discussed the matter of Taylor Swift's likely endorsement of Biden with Donald Trump. The publication reports that behind the scenes, Trump has reacted to the possible scenario ""not with alarm, but with an instant projection of ego"".

How so? Well, Trump has apparently privately claimed that he is ""more popular"" than Swift is and that he has more committed fans than she does.

He's probably still very sore that he was not named TIME magazine's 2023 Person of the Year - an honour that went to... You know or guessed it.

Predictably, Fox News had their say.

Host Jeanine Pirro, who was an informal political adviser to Trump, warned Swift to stay away: ""Don't get involved. Don't get involved in politics; we don't want to see you there.""

""Joe Biden is in a hole with young people, he knows it,"" she added. ""And if he thinks Taylor can get him out of that hole, he's gonna go for it.""

Also on Fox News, sports broadcaster Charly Arnolt begged Swifties to not vote for Biden, refocused the debate on Swift's carbon footprint when touring, and concluded by saying: ""Please don't believe everything Taylor Swift says. We're all begging you.""

Arnolt quoted a recent poll that says that apparently one fifth of Swift fans would back whichever candidate she endorsed, adding: ""Let's be honest, a lot of her fanbase are 15-year-old girls who can't vote anyways.""

Ouch.

But ouch right back at Arnolt, as a 2023 Morning Consult survey found that 45 per cent of Swifties are millennials (between the ages of 27 and 42) and only 21 percent are Gen Z (26 and under).

American entrepreneur and 2024 Republican race drop out Vivek Ramaswamy recently suggested that the National Football League (NFL) will rig the upcoming Super Bowl to increase publicity for Taylor Swift and her partner, Kansas City Chiefs' Travis Kelce.

(In case you haven't been following the latest updates, the Chiefs recently won the AFC championship, which has punched their ticket to the Super Bowl next month.)

""I wonder who's going to win the Super Bowl next month. And I wonder if there's a major presidential endorsement coming from an artificially culturally propped-up couple this fall,"" he posted X - possibly wearing a tin hat and definitely playing footsie with ring-wing conspiracy theorists. ""Just some wild speculation over here, let's see how it ages over the next 8 months.""

Cue: outrageous claims that Swift and Kelce are part of the deep state, plotting to sway this year's election, and that the NFL are in cahoots.

""I have never been more convinced that the Super Bowl is rigged,"" X-posted the right-wing influencer Jack Lombardi, after the Chiefs defeated the Baltimore Ravens 17-10. ""With all the unneeded and unwanted Taylor coverage at the games. KC's journey to the Super Bowl - totally scripted. Next... Travis and Taylor together at the Super Bowl, appearing happy, and in love. Then KC wins. And then later announcing their support for Biden.""

Lombardi's then doubled down: ""This is the ol, cheerleader falling for the football star story. And it has one purpose, to capture and manipulate the feelings of American women. And once Taylor has their attention, she will endorse Joe Biden, which was they goal the whole time. And as a father of little girls, it is my job to project their feelings from manipulation like this. So as a girl dad, I am disgusted.""

For those of you wondering, ""girl dad"" is not just about signalling that you have a daughter, but used as a rather pathetic way of trying to get your point across without being accused of misogyny or chauvinism. Essentially, a pathetic online defence mechanism to claim legitimacy and mask toxicity because you happen to have a female child.

But back to the very hinged pundits.

Podcast host Mike Crispi chipped in, posting that the NFL ""is totally RIGGED for the Kansas City Chiefs, Taylor Swift, Mr. Pfizer (Travis Kelce). All to spread DEMOCRAT PROPAGANDA.""

(""Mr. Pfizer"" is the right-wing nickname for Kelce, who dared to promote the Covid-19 vaccine. Catchy.)

Trump die-hard and ""proud Islamophobe"" Laura Loomer also weighed in when she wrote on X that ""the Democrats' Taylor Swift election interference psyop is happening in the open... It's not a coincidence that current and former Biden admin officials are propping up Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. They are going to use Taylor Swift as the poster child for their pro-abortion GOTV Campaign.""

As you can see, MAGA is in full meltdown mode.

Loomer followed it up by ""shaming"" the New York Post for ""putting a picture of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce making out on the football field above the headline regarding the 3 US Servicemen who were killed in the drone strike in Jordan yesterday This is really vile. Our country has zero priorities.""

As for far-right influencer Rogan O'Handley, he suggested that if the Chiefs won the Super Bowl, there could be more global repercussions...

""You MUST defeat the Chiefs,"" O'Handley wrote in an X post addressed to the San Francisco 49ers. ""If you don't, Mr. Pfizer and his girlfriend are going to tour the country as 'world champions' helping elect Joe Biden WW3 will likely follow in a 2nd Biden term and millions will die. The fate of the free world rests upon your shoulders""

The words 'hinged', 'reasonable' or the phrase 'modicum of sanity' are ones that come to mind when scrolling through hundreds of similar posts that cast Taylor Swift as the future Typhoid Mary and a government weapon ready to be unleashed.

And she hasn't even endorsed Biden yet.

One thing is abundantly clear: Outspoken or not, Swift is getting to the MAGA crowd, and so many of these reactions betray a deep and persistent worry that her endorsement for Biden could have a quantifiable impact.","Taylor Swift's endorsement of Joe Biden could prove crucial for Democrats.

2024-01-16,"Mental strain, deepening risks as Israel's war with Hamas reaches 100 days","JERUSALEM, Jan 14 (Reuters) - One hundred days after Hamas gunmen broke out of Gaza to launch the deadliest attack in Israel's history, tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed, Gaza lies in ruins and the Middle East is sliding towards a wider, more unpredictable conflict.

For both Israelis and Palestinians, the war has been a trauma that looks likely to last for years, deepening the hostility and mistrust that have stood in the way of peace for more than 75 years.

""No one will win,"" said Rebecca Brindza, a spokesperson for families of the 240 Israelis and foreigners seized as hostages during attack on communities around the Gaza Strip that opened the war on Oct. 7.

The assault in the early morning hours caught Israel's vaunted military and security services completely off guard, opening days of fear and uncertainty for the country as the details of the slaughter by the rampaging gunmen emerged.

The attack killed more than 1,200 people, the biggest single day loss of life since the founding of the state of Israel in 1948, and the shock was compounded by the multiple accounts of rape and sexual violence that emerged in the following weeks.

The Israeli response was immediate and unrelenting, beginning with a systematic aerial bombardment and followed by a ground invasion that have together laid waste to Gaza and forced almost 2 million people to flee their homes.

Almost 24,000 Palestinians have been killed and 60,000 wounded in the invasion, according to Gaza health authorities, the largest loss of Palestinian life suffered in the decades of wars and conflict with Israel since 1948.

Three months on, Israeli troops are still battling Hamas Islamist militants in the ruins of Gaza and hunting architects of the October attack, such as Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza and Mohammed Deif, the movement's military leader.

Most of the enclave's hospitals have been destroyed, hunger is a growing threat and a dire humanitarian crisis threatens to end up killing even more Gazans than the Israeli military.

In a statement marking the 100 days, the Palestinian ministry of foreign affairs accused Israel of creating ""a circle of death"" in Gaza.

Israeli officials say they do all they can to avoid civilian casualties and they accuse Hamas of hiding its network of tunnels and military infrastructure among Gaza's civilian population, deliberately putting them at risk.

Yet that offers little comfort to the tens of thousands who have lost relatives to the bombardment.

""I come here everyday, longing for them,"" said Khaled Abu Aweidah, who lost 22 members of his family to an air strike and who still searches the mountains of rubble that was his family home in vain for any sign of three children buried there.

SHOCKED

World opinion has been shocked and the bitterness of the conflict has spilled out into angry demonstrations on the streets of European cities and American college campuses, casting its shadow over the U.S. presidential election.

Across the Arab world, there has been outrage at the killing and destruction and at widely seen images of Palestinian prisoners stripped to their underwear.

Even Washington, Israel's closest ally, has urged restraint and South Africa has brought a case before the International Court of Justice, accusing Israel of genocide, a charge it rejects as a gross and hypocritical distortion of the truth.

Efforts to agree a ceasefire have so far failed and the future of Gaza, which has been under blockade for more than 15 years, remains up in the air, while violence in the volatile cities of the occupied West Bank has spiralled to levels that in other times would cause deep alarm.

The United States and other powers have called for a revival of a process to create an independent Palestinian state after the war but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing government has so far failed to respond.

Israel's main enemy Iran, which backs Hamas, has taunted Israel but has so far refrained from direct action and Hezbollah, its proxy in Lebanon, has taken care to avoid an all-out confrontation.

However, the Houthis in Yemen, another Iran-backed movement, have caused increasing turmoil by attacking shipping in the Red Sea, bringing nearer the threat of a wider conflict that could draw in outside powers and further destabilize the global order.

For their part, Israelis see Hamas as an existential threat to their country and surveys show they support the campaign to destroy the group, even though most blame Netanyahu for the security failures that allowed the Oct. 7 attack to take place.

Posters showing the hostages are plastered on walls and bus stops across Israel and Sunday saw large demonstrations, demanding the return of more than 130 still held in Gaza after a truce in November, during which around half were swapped for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.

""Israel's society is gripped by trauma and we cannot heal without them all coming back,"" said Moran Stella Yanai, a former hostage returned in the swap who was kidnapped during the Nova music festival, where hundreds of party-goers were killed on the morning of Oct. 7.

As the war goes on, it imposes an increasing strain on the economy and the army has begun releasing some of the tens of thousands of reservists called up to fight Hamas and guard the northern border to enable them to return to their jobs.

But Netanyahu, whose political future will depend on the outcome of the war, has shown no sign that he was listening to the growing calls for an end to the fighting.

""We are continuing the war until the end - until total victory,"" he said on Saturday at a news conference to mark the 100 days of the war.","Almost 24,000 Palestinians have been killed and 60,000 wounded in the invasion.

2024-01-16,Morning Bid: Japan's equity juggernaut rolls on,"Jan 16 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets.

Another day, another leap to a fresh 34-year peak. Is there anything that will stop the Japanese equity juggernaut?

There isn't much on the Asian economic and policy calendar to give markets a steer on Tuesday - volume will pick up as U.S. markets reopen after the Monday holiday - but Japanese producer price figures could give Japan bulls pause for thought.

Or the green light for another whoosh higher.

The consensus view in a Reuters poll of economists suggests the year-on-year disinflation in the country's goods-producing sector seen over the last year flipped into outright deflation in December.

The annual rate of goods inflation is expected to fall to -0.3% in December from 0.3% in November, sliding below zero for the first time since February 2021. A year ago in December 2022, prices were rising at a 10.2% annual rate.

These figures will be closely scrutinized. Easing producer price pressures will likely keep consumer inflation on its downward path toward the Bank of Japan's 2% target, relieving the pressure on the central bank to ""normalize"" policy.

The Japanese bond market reflects the extent to which investors are rethinking the BOJ policy path, with the two-year yield on Monday falling below zero for the first time since July.

The Nikkei 225 index registered its sixth consecutive rise on Monday through 36,000 points. The cumulative gain in those six sessions is almost 10%, so perhaps a hotter-than-expected producer price report will be the catalyst for some profit-taking.

On a longer-term horizon, the market may be ripe for a correction too. Otavio Costa at Crescat Capital notes that Japanese stock market cap is around 150% of GDP, which he reckons makes it one of the most overvalued in the world.

In China, meanwhile, the central bank on Monday surprised markets by keeping its medium-term policy rate steady, dashing hopes for a cut to shore up the country's uneven post-pandemic recovery.

The People's Bank of China disappointed market expectations for a cut as it held the rate on almost 1 trillion yuan worth of one-year medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans to some financial institutions unchanged at 2.50%. The MLF was last cut in August 2023, from 2.65%.

The PBOC is in a tight spot. The economy needs stimulus but cutting rates will probably push the already weak yuan even lower, which could risk domestic capital flight and deter investment from overseas.

The onshore yuan weakened anyway on Monday, sliding to a one-month low of 7.1813 per dollar, an indication of just how delicate the PBOC's task is.

Here are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Tuesday:",There isn't much on the Asian economic and policy calendar to give markets a steer on Tuesday.

2024-01-16,Talos Energy to acquire QuarterNorth Energy for $1.29 bln,"Jan 15 (Reuters) - Oil and gas company Talos Energy (TALO.N) said on Monday it will acquire privately held QuarterNorth Energy in a $1.29 billion cash and stock deal to bolster its presence in Mexico.

QuarterNorth is a privately held U.S. Gulf of Mexico exploration and production company with ownership in six major fields. Talos expects the acquisition to improve its base decline rate by approximately 20%.

QuarterNorth Energy will receive about 24.8 million shares of Talos's common stock and about $965 million in cash.

More than a dozen companies including Chevron (CVX.N) and Repsol (REP.MC) had quit offshore oil and gas exploration areas in Mexico last year after disappointing results. Only a handful of companies had made significant finds in the areas which included Talos.

The Houston-based Talos said that the acquisition will add about 30 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboe/d) for the full current year and adds about 69 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe) in proved reserves.

Talos Energy along with Grupo Carso hold 17.4% of Zama, a Mexican oil and gas project in the Gulf of Mexico with gross recoverable resources estimated at 735 million barrels, which can produce up to 190,000 barrels per day (bpd) of medium crude and associated gas.

""The addition of QuarterNorth's overlapping deepwater portfolio with valuable operated infrastructure will increase Talos's operational breadth and production profile while enhancing our margins and cash flow,"" said Talos CEO Timothy S. Duncan.

The company said it expects annual run-rate synergies of approximately $50 million by year-end 2024.

2024-01-15,Switzerland to host Ukraine peace summit at Zelenskiy's request,"Date and venue for summit to be determinedZelenskiy wants China to be involvedRussian invasion enters third year next month

BERN, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Switzerland on Monday agreed to host a global peace summit on Ukraine at the request of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

Neutral Switzerland has previously acted as a broker to resolve conflicts and could now help find a resolution for the war that began when Russia sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.

""At the request of the Ukrainian president, Switzerland has agreed to host a summit on the peace formula,"" the Swiss government said. ""Further details are now being worked out.""

Speaking alongside his Swiss counterpart Viola Amherd at a press conference in Bern, Zelenskiy did not provide an extensive list of the participants of the planned peace summit but hinted about who he wanted to attend.

""We are open to all countries that respect our sovereignty and territorial integrity at the peace summit, so draw conclusions about who we invite,"" Zelenskiy said.

""We would like the Global South to be present ... it is important for us to show that the whole world is against Russia's aggression, and the whole world is for a just peace.""

Neither Zelenskiy nor Amherd provided any details on when or where in Switzerland the summit might take place. They said their teams would begin organising it starting on Tuesday.

Zelenskiy was in Switzerland where he was due to meet other world leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

Among the dignitaries he could meet would be Chinese Premier Li Qiang, who is also in Davos this week.

Ukraine said on Sunday that it was vital that Beijing was involved in talks to end the conflict.

Zelenskiy said on Monday China, one of Russia's key allies, played ""a big role"" in the world, and he wanted Beijing to take part.

""We would very much like China to be involved in our (peace) formula, as well as in the summit,"" he said. ""But not everything depends on our wishes.""

Zelenskiy first announced his peace formula at a November summit of the Group of 20 major economies. His peace formula calls for restoring Ukraine's territorial integrity, withdrawal of Russian troops and cessation of hostilities, as well as the release of all prisoners and detainees, among other things.

2024-01-15,"China's 2023 bank lending at record high, but economy still struggling","C.bank keeps policy accommodative to support shaky recovery

BEIJING, Jan 12 (Reuters) - New bank lending in China rose less than expected in December, but 2023 lending hit a new record as the central bank kept policy accommodative to support an unexpectedly shaky economic recovery.

Chinese banks extended 1.17 trillion yuan ($163.31 billion) in new yuan loans in December, up from November but falling short of analysts' expectations, according to data released by the People's Bank of China on Friday.

Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted new yuan loans would rise to 1.40 trillion yuan in December from 1.09 trillion yuan the previous month, and comparable with 1.4 trillion yuan a year earlier.

For the year, new bank lending hit a record 22.75 trillion yuan -- roughly equivalent to the gross domestic product of the UK and up 6.8% from 21.31 trillion yuan in 2022 -- the previous record.

Still, the world's second-largest economy has struggled to regain traction, with a disappointing and short-lived post-COVID pandemic bounce. Consumer and business confidence remain weak, local governments are struggling under huge debts, and a protracted property crisis is weighing heavily on construction and investment.

With demand weak, the economy is also facing persistent deflationary pressures heading into 2024, keeping alive expectations for more policy easing measures to shore up growth.

""Monetary policy will be loosened as we face deflationary pressures,"" said Zong Liang, chief of research at state-owned Bank of China.

""Interest rates should be appropriately lowered given that real interest rates are relatively high.""

Other data released by China on Friday reinforced views of a highly uneven economic recovery, with exports edging up but deflationary pressures persisting amid weak domestic demand.

Next week, China will release data for December industrial output, investment and retail sales, along with fourth-quarter gross domestic product, which will give investors clues on whether the economy was able to regain some momentum heading into 2024 or will need further support.

China's economic growth is seen hitting the official target of around 5% in 2023, and the government is expected to stick with that target this year.

Analysts expect the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to unveil fresh easing steps soon to support the economy, amid concerns over deflationary pressures and questions over how long it will take the housing slump to bottom out.

The central bank is expected to ramp up liquidity injections and cut a key interest rate when it rolls over maturing medium-term policy loans on Monday, as authorities try to get the shaky economy back on more solid footing.

But the central bank faces a dilemma as more credit is flowing to productive forces than into consumption, which could add to deflationary pressures and reduce the effectiveness of its monetary policy tools.

In 2023, household loans totalled 4.33 trillion yuan, or nearly 20% of the total new loans, while corporate loans amounted to 17.91 trillion yuan.

Broad M2 money supply grew 9.7% from a year earlier - the lowest since March 2022, central bank data showed, well below estimates of 10.1% forecast in the Reuters poll. M2 grew 10.0% in November from a year earlier.

Outstanding yuan loans grew 10.6% in December from a year earlier - hitting the lowest in over two decades, compared with 10.8% in November. Analysts had expected 10.8% growth.

Growth of outstanding total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, quickened to 9.5% in December from a year earlier and from 9.4% in November.

TSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales.

In December, TSF fell to 1.94 trillion yuan from 2.45 trillion yuan in November. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected December TSF of 2.20 trillion yuan.","New bank lending in China rose less than expected in December, but 2023 lending hit a new record.

2024-01-15,US says it shot down anti-ship cruise missile from Houthi-controlled areas,"WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - U.S. fighter aircraft shot down an anti-ship cruise missile fired from Houthi militant areas of Yemen toward a U.S. destroyer operating in the Southern Red Sea, the U.S. military said on Sunday.

The midair interception is the latest incident in the Red Sea where the Houthis have been attacking international shipping in what they say is a campaign to support Palestinians under seige from Israeli forces in Gaza.

It follows a series of American and British airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen that have drawn threats of a ""strong"" response from the Iranian-backed militia.

There were no injuries or damage reported in the latest incident, according to the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), which released the news in a statement posted on the social media platform X.

CENTCOM said the missile was shot down near Yemen's port city of Hodeidah.

Earlier on Sunday, the Houthis complained that U.S. aircraft were observed flying close to Yemeni airspace and coastal areas.

Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam described the activity by ""enemy"" aircraft as a blatant violation of national sovereignty.

Reuters could not immediately determine whether the incidents were one and the same. CENTCOM did not immediately respond to an email seeking further details about the interception.

The Red Sea crisis has added to anxieties over a wider conflict in the Middle East beyond Gaza, which Israel is reducing to rubble in what it says is a campaign to annihilate the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which rules the strip and, like the Houthis, is backed by Tehran.

Also on Sunday, pro-Palestinian activists protested at the gates of RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, angry that the British base was used as a launch pad for strikes against the Houthis.

""We are here because we condemn the complicity of the UK government and using Cypriot land for their agenda to support Israel in their onslaught of Gaza,"" said Natalia Olivia of the Cyprus-based United for Palestine organisation.",U.

2024-01-15,Disappointed Osaka falls at first hurdle on Grand Slam return,"MELBOURNE, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Naomi Osaka was disappointed to bow out of the Australian Open in the first round on her Grand Slam return on Monday but thought she was making rapid progress in her comeback after 15 months out of the game.

The Japanese former world number one, who took time out to have daughter Shai, went down 6-4 7-6(2) to French 16th seed Caroline Garcia on the Rod Laver Arena court where she won two of her four Grand Slam titles.

""I thought it was a really good match. For me, I felt like I did the best that I could possibly do,"" she told reporters.

""I think I still feel like a bit disappointed ... I did feel nervous, but I felt like I kept telling myself to be positive. I thought I kept doing better as the match went on.

""So, yeah, I'm not too happy right now, but I think I can learn from the progress.""

Taking on the experienced Garcia was always going to be a big challenge for Osaka, who had played only two matches in Brisbane two weeks ago since her return to tournament tennis.

A double fault gave Garcia the first break point of the match in the fifth game and the former world number four converted it to edge ahead.

Osaka had a sniff of a break back at deuce in the eighth game but dumped a routine backhand into the net and Garcia held with back-to-back aces before going on to take the set.

BACK FOOT

Twice U.S. Open champion Osaka won her first three service games of the second set to love, but Garcia was serving so well that Osaka was unable to build any pressure with her returns.

""I felt like I was constantly on my back foot and really hesitant,"" Osaka added.

""I was a little bit overthinking in my head where to go. I think that's something that will come in time, but right now it kind of sucks a little.""

Garcia, who raced through the second-set tiebreak to clinch her place in round two, said she was sure it would not be too long before Osaka was back at the top of the game.

""She has had an amazing career, she has been away for 15 months and been through a lot,"" the 30-year-old said.

""Six months after giving birth and she's playing amazing, so we have to watch out.""

It was Osaka's earliest exit in eight visits to the Australian Open and her third successive loss in the opening round of a Grand Slam after she fell at the first hurdle at the French and U.S. Opens in 2022.

The 26-year-old was clearly struggling to reconcile her disappointment at the loss with the fact that she was so competitive after such a long period on the sidelines.

""Of course, there's a voice in my head that is, 'Who are you to think you can come back and immediately start winning matches?',"" Osaka said.

""I don't know. I kind of always expect myself to stand a chance anyways.""",Naomi Osaka bows out of the Australian Open in the first round on her return.

2024-01-15,China urges larger-scale Gaza peace conference as conflict escalates,"BEIJING, Jan 15 (Reuters) - China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi called for a larger, more authoritative Israeli-Palestinian peace conference and a timetable to implement a two-state solution as the Gaza conflict escalated and the Red Sea became a new flash point.

Speaking to reporters after talks with Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry in Cairo over the weekend, Wang said the international community should ""listen"" carefully to the legitimate concerns in the Middle East.

His remarks were reported by state news agency Xinhua on Monday.

""China calls for the convening of a larger-scale, more authoritative and more effective international peace conference, the formulation of a specific timetable and road map for the implementation of the 'two-state solution', and support for the prompt resumption of Israel-Palestinian peace talks,"" Wang said.

Last week, the United States and Britain launched strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen after the group attacked ships in the Red Sea. The Houthis said their attacks are a show of support for Palestinians and Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza.

The Red Sea attacks have forced commercial ships to take a longer, costlier route around Africa, stoking concern about inflation and supply chain disruptions. They are also bringing the Gaza crisis much closer to China's investments in the Suez Canal east of Cairo.

China avoids being a direct party in any military conflicts, but says it is keen to raise its ""international influence, appeal and power"" to shape events through diplomacy.

Last week, Wang said President Xi Jinping had ""in-depth communication"" with the leaders of Saudi Arabia and Iran to persuade the Middle East powers to let go of past grievances.

Wang is currently travelling through Egypt, Tunisia, Togo and the Ivory Coast until Thursday.

China's top diplomat has also held talks with the Secretary-General of the Arab League on the Gaza conflict and expressed concerns over the Red Sea, Xinhua reported.

Equatorial maintained its top position for a second consecutive year, while Trafigura's TFG Marine rose one spot to become the second largest supplier, data from Singapore's Maritime and Port Authority showed.

Sinopec Fuel Oil Singapore jumped 16 spots to become the third largest supplier, the data showed. The company ramped up bunker sales volumes significantly in 2023 following its bunker supplier licence award in 2022, said industry sources.

Sinopec has bumped up its market share particularly for the high-sulphur market, rivalling PetroChina to become a dominant player in that category. The company has also expanded its storage capacity regionally.

PetroChina International Singapore dipped two spots to the fourth position in 2023, while Vitol Bunkers dipped one spot to rank fifth.

Meanwhile, Maersk Oil Trading, Chevron Singapore and BP Singapore were the top three marine biofuel suppliers in 2023.

Singapore marine fuel sales hit an all-time high of 51.82 million metric tons last year, driven by record container throughput and increased demand by shippers to trial alternative bunker fuels.

2024-01-15,Safe-haven gold gains on renewed Fed cut bets,"Spot gold may rise into $2,071-$2,079 range - technicalsMarket bets for 166 bps of U.S. rate cuts in 2024 -

Jan 15 (Reuters) - Gold prices edged up on Monday, holding above the $2,050 level on safe-haven appeal from elevated tensions in the Middle East and on renewed bets for an early rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve.

Spot gold was up 0.2% at $2,053.69 per ounce, as of 0435 GMT, after marking its biggest daily gain since Dec. 12 on Friday.

""Gold is just trading as a proxy for front end yields, which itself is a proxy for amped up expectations of rate cuts in the U.S.,"" with the market now looking past the higher-than-expected CPI figures, said Kyle Rodda, a financial market analyst at Capital.com.

Data on Friday showed U.S. producer prices unexpectedly fell in December, sending 10-year Treasury yields sliding in response.

Overall, traders are betting on 166 basis points (bps) of Fed rate cuts this year, higher than Friday morning's bets of 150 bps.

Traders are pricing in a 79% chance that they could begin as soon as March, according to LSEG's interest rate probability app, IRPR.

In the run up to the Fed's Jan. 30-31 meeting, things look reasonably constructive for gold, provided an absence of anything that proves that the U.S. economy is doing better than everyone's expecting, said Rodda.

According to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao, spot gold may break resistance at $2,060 per ounce and rise into the $2,071-$2,079 range.

2024-01-15,"China's record crude, coal, iron ore imports don't tell the whole story: Russell","LAUNCESTON, Australia, Jan 15 (Reuters) - China's imports of crude oil, coal and iron ore all soared to record highs in 2023, but this seemingly strong performance by the world's top commodity buyer comes with a few caveats.

Crude oil imports rose 11% in 2023 from the prior year to 11.28 million barrels per day (bpd), according to customs data released on Jan. 12.

This eclipsed the prior record of 10.81 million bpd from 2020, and came as China re-opened its economy after ending its strict zero-COVID policy at the end of 2022.

But is the gain in crude oil imports as impressive as it first appears?

In volume terms, 2023's arrivals were 1.11 million bpd higher than those in 2022.

However, this is well below the forecast for a 1.8 million bpd increase in China's oil demand from the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Of course, imports and total demand aren't the same thing, but looking at the other factors at work in China's crude oil market doesn't offer much support to the bullish view.

China's domestic oil production was only slightly higher, rising 1.8% in the first 11 months of 2023 compared to the same period a year earlier.

China is also continuing to add crude to either commercial or strategic inventories, with an estimated 670,000 bpd flowing to storage tanks in the first 11 months of the year.

China doesn't disclose the volumes of crude flowing into or out of strategic and commercial stockpiles, but an estimate can be made by deducting the amount of crude processed from the total of crude available from imports and domestic output.

In the first 11 months, the total available crude was 15.45 million bpd, while refinery throughput was 14.78 million bpd.

The volume being stored is slightly down on the 740,000 bpd added to inventories in 2022, but it still shows that China's refineries were building stockpiles, especially in the first half of 2023, rather than buying crude because domestic consumption was strong.

The last factor is China's exports of refined products, which jumped 16.7% in 2023 from the prior year to 62.69 million metric tons, which works out to about 1.37 million bpd, using the BP Plc standard conversion of 8 barrels of products per ton of crude.

This was the highest refined product exports since 2019, and was also about 190,000 bpd higher than the level recorded in 2022.

Putting all the factors together shows that while China imported record crude oil volumes, it also boosted fuel exports, kept crude flowing into inventories and fell well short of the optimistic forecasts for a surge in demand in 2023.

COAL DEMAND

China's imports of coal surged in 2023, jumping 61.8% from the prior year to reach 474.42 million tons.

While China's electricity demand did increase, the strong gain in coal imports was more related to factors that may prove to be temporary in nature.

Thermal power generation rose as hydropower struggled, with output dropping 7.1% in the first 10 months of the year.

The price of seaborne thermal coal also retreated sharply in 2023, making it more competitive against domestic production, which also struggled to rise fast enough to meet the increased electricity demand.

For 2024, it is likely that hydropower generation will increase, as will other renewables such as wind and solar, which may limit the increase in demand for thermal coal.

Iron ore was the surprise packet of China's commodity imports in 2023, with arrivals rising 6.6% from 2022 to reach an all-time high of 1.18 billion tons.

The increase was in spite of the well-publicised struggles of the key residential property sector, which in turn contributed to the modest - by China's standards - economic growth of around 5.4%.

But steel output is likely to hit a record high in 2023, as other sectors performed well, including vehicle manufacturing, infrastructure and exports of steel products.

The question for 2024 is whether China will continue to produce high volumes of steel, and the answer is that the economy is likely to grow sufficiently to use more steel, but not by enough to spark a surge in production.

This means that iron ore is likely to see modest increases in imports, but even that will result in another record year.

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.","Crude oil imports rose 11% in 2023 from the prior year to 11.28 million bpd.

2024-01-15,"'It's going to happen', organisers defend late Melbourne finishes","MELBOURNE, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Tournament director Craig Tiley said on Monday that late finishes are inevitable at the Australian Open despite the introduction of an extra day this year to help with fixture congestion.

The year's first Grand Slam is notorious for its late finishes and in 2008 a match between Lleyton Hewitt and Marcos Baghdatis famously concluded at 4:33 a.m.

The final match of the first day of the 15-day Australian Open on Sunday started at 11:41 p.m. (1241 GMT) after Novak Djokovic had taken four hours to win his first-round match against qualifier Dino Prizmic.

Mercifully, women's defending champion Aryna Sabalenka raced through her tournament opener in less than an hour but Tiley said players had to expect to play into the early hours at Melbourne Park on occasion.

""We finished at 12:35 a.m. and we have taken the edge off having the possibility of late finishes,"" Tiley told Australia's Channel Nine on Monday.

""Nobody could predict that Novak would have gone over four hours to play a qualifier. No one would have predicted that putting a schedule on.

""It's going to happen and it will happen again, it could happen tonight or tomorrow night.""

The WTA and ATP Tours made a joint announcement this month limiting the number of matches that can be scheduled on a court in an evening session and banning contests beginning after 11 p.m. in the interests of player welfare.

The four Grand Slams are not, however, bound by the rules of the tours.

While Tennis Australia said the addition of the extra day was made with player welfare in mind, former world number one John McEnroe described it as a ""money grab"".

Players, including Djokovic, backed the extension of the tournament if it resulted in fewer late finishes.

2024-02-01,Disillusioned  --  why are American suburbs failing?,"Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

The US is fundamentally a country of suburbs. More than 55 per cent of Americans live in the communities that surround the nation's major cities in ever-widening concentric rings.

Starting in the 1940s with Long Island's Levittown, new developments offered GIs returning from the second world war and their families the promise of a fresh start with thousands of cookie-cutter homes and state-of-the-art parks, recreation centres and above all schools, all at affordable prices. While some larger cities built rail networks, most relied on the burgeoning highway system to open up new land for development and get people to and from work.

The rituals of American suburban life, from country club tennis tournaments to carpools and high school proms, went on to permeate global culture for decades through movies and television shows from Sixteen Candles to Desperate Housewives. US presidential elections have often been won or lost in the suburbs as independent voters once stereotyped as ""soccer moms"" shifted between the Republican and Democratic parties depending on the issues of the day. This year's likely rematch between Joe Biden and Donald Trump is no different: the winner's path to the White House lies through swing state suburbs outside Pittsburgh and Atlanta, rather than the already deeply blue cities of New York or the bright red rural counties in Iowa.

But all is not well with this slice of Americana, as Benjamin Herold reports in a deeply researched new book, Disillusioned. He argues that decades of short-sighted planning decisions, which produced ""slash and burn"" development, have left many communities struggling to fulfil their promises, even as a wider range of Americans moved in.

""In every corner of the country, the ensuing disillusionment was forcing families to reckon with an unsettling new question: what if the American dreams suburbia was built on weren't enough to lead us out of the enormous problems that nearly a century of mass suburbanisation had created,"" writes Herold.

Outside dozens of US cities, a pattern set in the late 1940s has repeated itself, with devastating results: newly built infrastructure and government levies on new construction helped many suburban communities offer residents both a panoply of services and low taxes. But by the time the bills for maintaining and updating the infrastructure came due, the original beneficiaries had raised their children and moved on. Most communities had also largely run out of open land for new development, providing a double hit to tax returns.

The politically popular decisions to rely on developer levies rather then setting higher education taxes and to invest more in highways to far-flung new suburbs than in mass transit in older ones, ""encouraged us to cycle through a series of disposable communities with shelf lives just long enough to extract a little more opportunity before we moved out [and] stuck someone else with the bill,"" Herold writes.

Disillusioned follows five very different families as they cope with the wreckage created by this outward spiral of development. Each one chases the American dream to new communities but the parents then find themselves having to fight to get their children the opportunities and support they were seeking.

Because this is America, there is also a toxic racial angle to this tale. Discriminatory covenants and biased lending practices initially kept many suburbs exclusively white, so the benefits of new construction went to them. Herold describes how black and brown families including the Adesinas outside Chicago and the Smiths outside Pittsburgh are empowered to move in by the civil rights movement and rising incomes, while many whites, like the Becker family outside Dallas, are moving out to the next ring of suburbs in search of newer homes.

These days all American racial groups are more likely to live in the suburbs than in centre cities, and 45 per cent of suburbanites are nonwhite, a larger proportion than the 41 per cent share in the country as a whole.

Herold's stories zigzag across the country. He visits older ""inner ring"" communities near Pittsburgh and Los Angeles now saddled with a shrinking tax base. In Evanston, a Chicago suburb, he explores a liberal, largely middle class community as it seeks to defy the odds and create a truly integrated schools system.

The author delves into challenges of the farther flung suburbs outside Atlanta and Dallas that have been siphoning off those who can afford to dream of new homes -- or fear the growing numbers of less affluent black and brown families who are replacing white retirees in older communities. More than 15mn American suburbanites now live below the poverty line, a larger number than in all its big cities combined.

The book's structure is in some ways reminiscent of Common Ground, J Anthony Lukas' groundbreaking tale of the Boston busing crisis of the 1970s. Individual stories are woven together with demographic and historical research to build a compelling portrait of just what is going wrong. The rapid switches from place to place can be disorienting, but the individual struggles Herold describes help bring to life what could otherwise be bloodless discussions of planning and education policy.

Each family is taken on its own terms without judging, although Herold clearly recognises that the burdens are not being spread evenly. He describes the aspirations and fears that prompt the white, Trump-supporting Becker family to flee their diversifying Dallas neighbourhood for a snazzy new school district that is deliberately zoned to prevent the construction of apartments. Meanwhile outside Atlanta, the black Robinson family also moves further out in search of better schools, only to find themselves battling the education system over racial stereotyping and harsh discipline of non-white children.

Herold's personal anguish about the troubles he spotlights gives the book extra power. He grew up and thrived in an inner ring Pittsburgh neighbourhood, but his peers have moved on, leaving black newcomers like the Smith family to shoulder the gigantic bills coming due for decades of delayed maintenance to schools and the water system.

He does find some room for hope in Compton, a Los Angeles suburb that was home to a young George HW Bush in the 1940s but became an impoverished ghetto that would later feature in rap songs as a signifier of both black pride and rage at persistent racism. The site of notorious riots in the 1990s, by the time Herold visits, Compton's black families are also starting to move out and it is increasingly home to first generation immigrants seeking new life, like the Hernandez family. As the community tries to rebuild, Herold finds much to admire in its dedicated educators and innovative efforts to boost test scores. ""It's kind of like when you have a burnt forest and you start to see the flowers poke through,"" he quotes one teacher saying.

The book's final section traces the ravages of Covid, which end up crystallising many of suburbia's issues for the families who suffered through it. In Compton, the Hernandez family become so disheartened that we leave them considering a return to Mexico. The Dallas-based Becker family pull their children out of public schools in favour of Christian home-schooling, and the families outside Chicago and Atlanta also share their disappointment with Herold. ""The illusion that suburbia remains somehow separate from America's problems is no longer viable,"" he writes.

Disillusioned also benefits from an unusual epilogue that helps it rise above a standard journalistic tale. One of the parents Herold followed, Bethany Smith, a black mother from his old Pittsburgh neighbourhood, grew uncomfortable with letting a white man tell her story and bend it to his narrative arc of how the suburbs failed.

After she confronted him about it, he agreed to give her the last word by writing a chapter of her own. In it she refuses to give up on the dreams that continue to drive millions of Americans to the suburbs while remaining clear eyed about the challenges ahead: ""We want to build good lives for ourselves . . . to raise our children in safe environments . . . the same deal that the suburbs gave white families like Ben's. This time though, we want it to last.""

2024-02-01,Tech bros want to live forever. They should be studying human ovaries,"Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

In the spring of 2017, celebrities and scientists gathered at the Los Angeles home of legendary television producer Norman Lear and his wife Lynn. The Hollywood power couple, outspoken supporters of myriad liberal causes, were also interested in the burgeoning field of longevity science. Among the speakers invited to update attendees on the latest advancements was Nicole Shanahan, the CEO of an intellectual property software company in Silicon Valley. Shanahan, a slight woman, with long, highlighted hair, told the audience about the relatively mundane but valuable process of tracking new research through the patent system.

She was followed on stage by Victor Dzau, a veteran doctor in his seventies and president of the US National Academy of Medicine. Dzau evangelised the importance of tackling ageing and announced a scientific competition seeking new ways to extend human lifespan. But Shanahan couldn't concentrate. Her body grew hot and her face flushed, as her public role collided with her private hopes.

She and her partner, Google co-founder Sergey Brin, had been trying and failing to harvest eggs for a future conception. Despite being just 31, Shanahan was haunted by the fear that her life was being shaped by an organ that had been ageing since before she was born. Early in a female foetus's development, she has about six million eggs. Only a couple of million make it to birth. By the time she hits puberty, she has 300,000 to 400,000 and then begins losing 1,000 immature eggs a month. By the time she's 40, she may have fewer than 10 per cent left.

Shanahan flicked open the Flo app that tracked her fertility. ""As I was watching another ovulation cycle go by, Victor was on stage saying, 'We have to change the narrative on longevity. Ageing is a disease. It's tractable. We have to treat this as a moonshot,'"" she recalls. ""And each one of those things went through my head as I was thinking about my own ovulation. It was a moment of powerful insight.""

At the cocktail hour after the presentations, Shanahan peppered every expert she could find with the same set of questions: ""Have you heard about reproductive longevity? Who is working on this?"" Shanahan had been closely watching Silicon Valley's growing obsession with longevity. Between 2013 and 2022, funding for companies working in the field soared from $600mn to $4.6bn, according to PitchBook data. But she eventually found that, while men were funding myriad ways to lengthen their own lives, barely anyone was researching how to slow ageing ovaries and help women have children for longer.

When Shanahan scoured the patent corpus for advances on women's reproductive longevity, she found ""virtually nothing"". The only research was responding to the age-old pressure for women to look young. ""It was mostly shiny hair and soft skin. It was very superficial, and none of it was about the core functions of being biologically woman,"" she says.

In fact, science had neglected women's health in general for decades, often seeing the differences in female bodies as confounding factors to be stripped out, rather than studied to improve the lives of more than half of the population. In the US, clinical trials were not obliged to include women until 1993. In the UK today, only about 2 per cent of medical research funding is spent on pregnancy, childbirth and fertility.

This lack of money for basic research means, from a scientific perspective, that ovaries -- the glands which produce the eggs that guarantee the continuation of the human species -- are essentially a mystery. Fundamental questions remain unanswered: why are the ovaries one of the first organs to age? Why does the quantity and quality of eggs fall so dramatically? Why do humans go through menopause when most animals do not? And why does the age of menopause vary wildly between individual women?

Shanahan has been on a quest for answers ever since. In the process, the 38-year-old became the most influential individual funder of reproductive longevity research. If she is successful, this new knowledge may have the kind of profound consequences that came with the arrival of the contraceptive pill. Advancements that could give women more control over their bodies and power a new era of equality. They could offer women more freedom to pursue careers and the right relationships, and help countries facing declining birth rates. And the ovaries, it turns out, could offer clues to extending the lifespan of all humans.

About a decade ago, Silicon Valley's billionaires turned their attention to defeating death. They wanted to spend some of the proceeds of building world-changing technologies on clearing the final hurdle for humanity. A 2013 Time magazine cover breaking the news that the search company founded by Brin and Larry Page was funding a major new life-extension division, asked: ""Can Google solve death?""

The idea seemed radical, even ridiculous, but there had been some recent breakthroughs to build on. In the previous two decades, researchers discovered more about genes and the metabolic pathways that dictate the pace of ageing and had even shown that extending lifespan was possible. At least, in worms and mice. Doing the same for human beings was merely another moonshot, like developing self-driving cars or landing on Mars.

But, in practice, Silicon Valley's ""move fast"" ethos sometimes collided with the glacial pace of medical development. Some entrepreneurs experimented on themselves, engaging in so-called biohacking. When experiments showed that blood transfusions from younger to older mice could rejuvenate their brains, some biohackers began to seek young plasma. The practice was skewered on HBO's Silicon Valley in the form of ghoulish tech billionaire Gavin Belson conducting pitch meetings with his ""blood boy"" in tow. Other techies obtained off-label prescriptions for drugs such as metformin, the diabetes medicine that researchers hypothesise could slow ageing, but have not yet definitively proven.

Then there were the extreme personal regimes. Ray Kurzweil, the famed inventor and a Google executive, consumed a daily diet of a hundred pills, as part of a plan to be frozen after death and resurrected by future technology. More recently, the entrepreneur Bryan Johnson, who has spent millions on trying to reverse his body's ageing, has become a reliable generator of bizarre headlines. (He stopped infusing blood from his 17-year old son, though, deeming it ineffective.)

Shanahan had a front-row seat as Brin launched Calico, Google's ambitious life-extension moonshot. She was generally critical of the ""longevity bros"", the cadre of men in Silicon Valley who cannot accept their impotence in the face of death. ""The primary male-tech-founder attraction to longevity comes from a fear of death. A real fear of death, the afterlife, spirituality and justice,"" Shanahan says. ""My experience with these individuals is that it is very much self-motivated.""

Shanahan grew up in a Bay Area, far removed from Silicon Valley's power elite. Until she was 17, she lived in Oakland. Her family was on government assistance, and Shanahan craved a ""very stable middle-class American life, with a dad and a mom and children and a dog"". She went to university at Puget Sound in Washington State, later becoming a lawyer and an entrepreneur. She met Brin in 2014 at a yoga festival in Tahoe, California; they were married four years later.

A craze for egg-freezing had swept through Silicon Valley before the couple started trying to get pregnant. Large tech companies such as Apple and Facebook added costly oocyte cryopreservation -- freezing a woman's younger, healthier eggs in order to postpone pregnancy -- to the long list of employee benefits, alongside free meals and laundry. At the time, Shanahan believed that ""was the ultimate new tool for extending female reproductive years"". But she quickly discovered it was not a simple process, repeatedly going to clinics to find that she couldn't have the procedure that month because of cysts on her ovaries. She recalls being offered little information or advice beyond to try again the following month. ""This was very disruptive to my life,"" she says. ""I was a CEO of a start-up. I was beginning my philanthropic career. And I was running a household with Sergey, who was still very active at Google, and I had stepkids.""

By the fifth time she was turned away, she was emotionally exhausted and exasperated with a system that seemed at best a ""Band-Aid"". ""You begin to question your entire existence,"" she says, pausing to remember how she felt at the time. ""You begin to think of what a life is like [if you] never have children. And that is painful. It's scary. It's saying goodbye to something before you even had a chance at it.""

Shanahan felt IVF was sold as a ""saving grace"" to her and her peers. The statistics show that is far from the case. Each round only works about one-third of the time for a woman under 35, with success rates falling as she ages. Shanahan began to view IVF as a ""commercial endeavour"" rather than a scientific one. ""It became abundantly clear that we just don't have enough science for the things we are telling and selling to women,"" she says. She admits her opinion is unpopular, then adds: ""It's one of the biggest lies that's being told about women's health today.""

The curved white stone building that houses the Buck Institute for Research on Aging rises above the mist on a hill in Marin, over the bay from San Francisco. Inside, experts in white coats study worms, mice and humans to discover more about the basic mechanisms of ageing and age-related diseases, such as neurodegeneration and cancer. The Buck began its pioneering work in the late 1990s, after oil heiress Beryl Hamilton Buck donated part of her estate to help the aged of the county.

In late 2017, Shanahan drove up the winding road to the summit where the institute is located. She was planning to pitch her software, but her mind was still whirring from the event at the Lears'. Shanahan remembers being the only woman in the meeting. ""On a whim,"" she decided to pitch research on reproductive ageing. Though she was essentially offering to fund the work, her suggestion was met by a ""respectful ambivalence"" in the room.

But when the idea was floated internally, it generated considerable excitement, particularly from the women. The biggest cheerleader was Jennifer Garrison, a fast-talking neuroscientist in her forties, who started her career at Nasa. When they first met, Garrison was surprised by Shanahan's youth and her casual demeanour. Shanahan was somewhat suspicious that Garrison was a neuroscientist, with no history of working on women's reproductive health. ""I was like, 'Well, this is a big jump isn't it?' And she said, 'No, I think reproduction starts in the brain,'"" Shanahan recalls. (Garrison is interested in how the brain's control centre, the hypothalamus, sends signals about ageing around the body, including to the ovaries.) ""And I was like, 'Well, who am I to say otherwise? Let's do it.'""

The result was the Center for Reproductive Longevity and Equality and a consortium that makes philanthropic investments in reproductive longevity research. Garrison is the centre's director, helping decide where bets are placed. Scientists at the Buck began to work on reproductive ageing projects, looking at how a key coenzyme that influences metabolism, by helping enzymes, can affect ovarian reserve and reproductive lifespan, and studying how the conversation between the brain and the ovaries changes as we age.

Shanahan wasn't simply funding a field but creating one, pulling together expertise from across the sciences. Just three of the original 23 grantees had any background in the area. To help scientists enter the field, the centre plans to run ""ovary bootcamps"", where researchers can learn to experiment on animal ovaries, as well as a biobank for human tissue, which is hard to obtain because few women donate their ovaries to research. Garrison draws a clear link between the lack of funding and the lack of knowledge about how women's reproductive systems age. ""There's not enough data for doctors to treat their patients,"" she says. ""There's not enough data for us to understand literally how the female body works, so that we can think about menus of treatments . . . rather than Band-Aids.""

Garrison is not inspired by a sci-fi vision of elderly women having babies, a generation of female Mick Jaggers. She says she doesn't have a ""strong opinion"" on whether women should have children at 70, but that's not the aim of the work. The aim is to slow down the process and improve the symptoms of the menopause. ""The fact that we go through menopause right in the middle of our lives really has a strong effect on everything we do as adults. Every choice we make has to be somehow informed by that knowledge,"" she says. Moreover, it affects health in almost every way, from cognitive function to bone strength. ""Going through menopause is the worst thing that can happen to a woman in terms of her health,"" Garrison says. ""It's not like a gradual decline. It's like falling off a cliff.""

In 2018, Shanahan got pregnant ""magically"", without intervention, and gave birth to a daughter. It was a happy turn of events that she says highlighted how little the fertility clinics had really known about her body. ""I'm learning now that it wasn't magic at all. I was actually very healthy. And it turns out many women have these moments of surprise conception when they least expect it.""

By then, Shanahan was well on her way to widely funding reproductive longevity research. In 2019, she travelled to Washington, DC, to announce a $10mn donation at the National Academy of Medicine. Before she went on stage, she discussed the plan with the men at her table, directors of health agencies from around the world. ""I gave them my pitch on women's reproductive longevity as a field of science,"" she recalls. ""And I thought that I was making such incredible headway because everyone was nodding. I was like, this is fantastic. They really understand. And then once I finished my pitch, the first question asked was: 'Well, what about sperm?'""

When her name was called, Shanahan headed to the stage, feeling outraged that supposed leaders in the field couldn't manage to focus on the need to fund women's health. So she upped the ante, surprising many in attendance by announcing a far-larger commitment of $100mn.

The money should help scientists fill the gaps in our understanding of women's health. One place to start is by investigating why human women are so different from many female animals. The consortium is funding researchers who study ants. Some species can oscillate between fertile and infertile periods; some have fertile queens that can live for up to 30 years. Other scientists backed by Shanahan are examining naked mole rats, which make eggs as adults and have exceptionally large ovarian reserves that help keep them fertile their entire lives.

Deena Emera, an evolutionary geneticist affiliated with the Buck and the author of A Brief History of the Female Body, says the animal kingdom could hold the key to problems humans are trying to solve. She is fascinated by the bowhead whale, a species that reproduces until it is 100 years old, at least. ""At some point, their ancestors didn't live as long,"" says Emera, ""and their maximum lifespan got longer. My hypothesis is that their reproductive lifespan also got longer. That was something that evolved.""

Emera is using her grant to compare the genomes of these giant mammals with other species, hoping to identify telling differences. If she can obtain whale ovaries, she wants to examine how the genes are expressed in the tissue. ""If there are really high levels in the bowhead whale ovary, what is that gene? And is it expressed in high levels in the human ovary or in the beluga whale ovary, which experiences menopause?"" she asks. Emera's work is in the very early stages. But if she does land on a key gene, she could attempt to manipulate it in mice and create a model for further experiments. Eventually, that could guide scientists to develop treatments that make humans a little more like those forever-fertile whales.

In 2019, Shanahan started discussions with the National University of Singapore about creating another research centre. Zhongwei Huang, an obstetrician and professor at the university, was already lobbying for more funding. ""I tell the women in front of me, 'I'm sorry, you are so-and-so old. And, unfortunately, your egg quality is so bad because of your age,'"" he says. He felt he was being disingenuous since some women are able to have children at older ages than others. ""I realised, 'Oh my god, this is the research that I should be doing: to find reasons why is this woman different from that woman.'""

Huang is collaborating with fertility centres to discover more biological signs that indicate ovarian conditions, so that doctors get better at predicting women's individual reproductive lifespans. Like some other researchers, Huang is intrigued by the potential of existing commercial drugs to extend overall lifespan. One example is rapamycin, originally developed as an immunosuppressant for organ transplant patients. It is now tested as a potential anti-ageing drug because it targets the mTor pathway, which regulates cellular growth and longevity. Scientists at Columbia University, who had their initial work funded by Shanahan's consortium, are now running a larger trial looking at whether rapamycin could delay the start of the menopause.

Francesca Duncan, who runs labs at Northwestern University and the Buck, was one of the few scientists working on reproductive ageing before Shanahan arrived. She says she was seen as an ""oddball"" in the longevity field, with many peers refusing to see what happened to women in their thirties as ""ageing"". When Duncan was at the University of Kansas, technicians in her lab noticed that the older the ovary, the harder it was to physically extract the eggs. Down the hall in the toxicology department, researchers were studying liver fibrosis, when the tissue becomes rigid with age. Duncan realised ovaries were suffering from the same problem.

Now, she is working to develop ways to measure this stiffness to track ovarian ageing using ultrasound techniques. ""I really liked this concept of explaining the nest, or the environment of the egg,"" Duncan says. ""Because if you can fix that nest, that's going to help that egg stay there for longer and be better quality.""

The consortium is not currently funding work on one area that has given some scientists' hope: in vitro gametogenesis. Researchers are experimenting with using stem cells to create new eggs and sperm from any cell in the human body. So far, this has only been achieved in mice, but advocates hope it could solve fertility problems in people and even enable same-sex couples to have children who combine their genes. Such an advance would have enormous commercial potential. Garrison says this would be ""very challenging"" to replicate in humans and doesn't believe it will ever be possible.

If successful, extending the age at which women can have children significantly would raise big questions. Would it end the ""motherhood penalty"" on women's salaries and career progression? What would the impact of having older mothers (and fathers) be on children? And, does it risk being a societal sticking plaster, where a drug is used to change women's biology, instead of reforming the worlds of work, childcare and relationships to suit women's needs?

Giacomo Vagni, a sociologist at the University of Essex who studies gender inequality, says there is evidence that women who have children later in life do not have as large a hit to their potential earnings, because they are more established in their careers. ""If a woman could have kids in her fifties, I think the penalty would definitely be much smaller,"" he says, adding that it also might stop companies from stigmatising women in their thirties who are viewed by some employers as more likely to take maternity leave.

Bioethicists are divided on how to think about the welfare of offspring born to older mothers, who will probably lose their parents earlier in their lifetimes, according to Glenn Cohen, a professor at Harvard Law School. ""Some say given the alternative is that no child exists, losing a parent early is not good but it is better than not existing at all,"" he explains. Others are inclined to prioritise what is ""species typical"": treating a woman whose fertility lags behind the average, rather than extending it beyond the norm, he adds.

In theory, medical progress should not prevent policies to achieve broader gender-equality goals. But it can be easier to sell a drug than to shift society. Just as the new generation of obesity medicines risks letting governments off the hook for ensuring universal access to healthy food, a breakthrough in female reproductive longevity could make it easier to ignore the challenges to earlier parenthood.

Shanahan recently rewatched a video of the first time she mentioned that longevity science could be important for women's equality. She was still giving presentations about patents but, this time, she noted it was her ""deeply held belief"" that progress in longevity research would track with social progress. ""We live in a time where most of us believe that we are created equal,"" she said, being interrupted by audience laughter at the clipart of gender symbols balancing on a see-saw on the screen above her. ""But in reality, half of us, meaning half of humankind, lose access to a fundamental part of themselves at the age of 30.""

Looking back, she says her early attempt to make this connection was ""awkward and I didn't get it all right, but it was a first step"". She explains that she felt at the time that framing women's health as part of longevity medicine was the ""richest opportunity"" to progress the women's movement. Seven years later, as more and more funds invest in longevity companies, she still faces a ""deafening silence"" when she asks if they would be interested in funding reproductive longevity research.

Unlike many of her male peers, Shanahan did not jump to start a company to tackle the problem, distrusting the commercial interests that were fiddling with women's fertility. Speaking at a National Academy of Medicine event last year, she explained that she's unusual in not having a commercial motive and then added, laughing: ""I got a divorce so I have less conflicts now. So yay for me."" (She and Brin separated in 2022.)

Instead, she is funding academic scientists who are working on the most fundamental problems. Because she is not seeking profit, she can also fund clinical trials for interventions that do not make money, such as whether exposure to sunlight could impact reproductive health. ""The world of funders is really divided into those with commercial interests and those without, and it's a lonely space in the field of medical science for those who have no commercial interest,"" she says.

Her work raising the profile of the problem has drawn in more government funding -- from Singapore and the US National Institutes on Aging -- but it is nowhere near enough. To create drugs that could really change women's (and men's) lives, scientists will need more than Shanahan's $100mn. She believes a ""nice lofty goal"" would be to raise $500mn, which would have a ""massive impact on the field"". Shanahan hasn't given up on recruiting men to the cause, urging them to see that this longevity problem is shaping billions of women's lives right now, as well as possibly helping with their ambitious plans to extend lives like their own.

There are even questions that longevity bros might want answered. One population study showed men whose sisters who had children after 45 were likely to live longer. One hypothesis is women who go through menopause later are better at repairing damage to their DNA -- and their brothers also have this trait. Finding out whether the ovaries offer clues about extending all human lifespan will require more funding, more research. But ""a lot of the male philanthropic funders might feel that it's out of their league,"" Shanahan says. ""I've heard one man tell me, 'That's above my paygrade.' I would love to put the message out that they have everything they need to know, they are fully qualified to fund this space, and we would welcome it.""","FT's Roula Khalaf is the Editor of the FT.

2024-02-01,Transcript: Viktor Orbán  --  the EU's chief disrupter,"Marc Filippino

Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Thursday, February 1st, and this is your FT News Briefing.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

The Federal Reserve is, once again, keeping interest rates on hold. And Boeing's January ended the same way it started, with some not-so-good news. Plus, the bad blood between the European Union and Viktor Orbán is nothing new, but now things are getting serious.

Ben Hall

I think he sees himself as the vanguard of a movement for a very different kind of EU.

Marc Filippino

I'm Marc Filippino, and here's the news you need to start your day.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

US interest rates seem to be on cruise control right now. Yesterday, the Federal Reserve decided to keep its benchmark rate right where it was at between 5 and 5.25 per cent, and Fed chair Jay Powell had some bad news for investors, chomping at the bit for rate cuts. They're probably not coming at the next meeting.

Jay Powell voice clip

I don't think it's likely that the committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify March as the time to do that.

Marc Filippino

Powell reminded everyone that the Fed's inflation target hasn't changed. It's still at 2 per cent. The last reading had inflation clocking in at 3.4 per cent. So the Fed still has some work to do.

Jay Powell voice clip

We just need to see more evidence that sort of confirms what we think we're seeing and that tells us that we are on a path to, a sustainable path down to 2 per cent inflation.

Marc Filippino

Markets weren't super happy with the news. Treasuries rallied and the S&P 500 fell 1.6 per cent.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

The European Union is locked in a battle with Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orbán. For months now, he's refused to back a plan that would send aid to Ukraine. And in response, the EU is looking for ways to bring him in line. And it really all comes to a head today at an emergency summit in Brussels. Ben Hall is the FT's Europe editor, and he joins me now to discuss. Hey, Ben.

Ben Hall

Hi, Marc.

Marc Filippino

OK, so this summit, Ben, what exactly is the EU hoping to accomplish here today?

Ben Hall

So what the EU wants to do is persuade Orbán to agree to, or at least not to veto, its proposed €50bn, four-year economic aid plan for Ukraine. This plan is essentially an add-on to the EU budget, and such matters are decided in the EU by unanimity. But it may well be that Orbán once again vetoes this fund, in which case the remaining 26 countries will have to come up with their own solution, which could be problematic.

Marc Filippino

OK, so Orbán's blocking this issue, and it's obviously causing a lot of headaches for the EU. Is it just the aid for Ukraine where he's creating problems for the bloc, or are there other things too?

Ben Hall

He has been a thorn in the side of the bloc for many years on many, many fronts. First of all, for what he's done domestically in terms of exerting tight political control over institutions and essentially turning Hungary into what he calls an illiberal democracy. That's a major problem. But he's also blocked routinely EU decisions on things he doesn't like. And then he has played the sort of renegade, if you like, in terms of courting powers that the EU might regard as rivals or even adversaries. So he's cosied up to Vladimir Putin. He's also dependent on Russia, for example, for nuclear power in Hungary.

Marc Filippino

So he's certainly not shy about voicing his concern in the European Union and throwing his weight around, basically. Why do you think he's doing that, Ben?

Ben Hall

I think EU officials and European diplomats think he's looking to extract concessions from Brussels, whether it's over money or whether it's to sort of weaken controls over what he does at home. I think Orbán himself presents it in more ideological terms. He sees himself as the sort of champion of a different kind of Europe that is true to more conservative Christian values, but also is a Europe of nation-states that is less integrated, where the EU institutions have less authority and interfere less in the lives of Hungarians or Poles or whatever. So I think he sees himself the vanguard of a movement for a very different kind of EU.

Marc Filippino

So going back to today's emergency EU summit, Ben, what happens if they can't get Orbán to agree to sign off on aid to Ukraine?

Ben Hall

Well, this is a long-standing question in the EU, which is how does it deal with countries that don't respect kind of fundamental values and the rule of law? He seemed to be doing Russia's bidding, frankly, in blocking aid to Ukraine. And they really don't have many levers to pull him into line beyond the sort of ultimate punishment, which is what the EU calls their Article 7 procedure, which can lead to Hungary losing its voting rights. That's the sort of maximum punishment that's allowed. Many consider it a kind of nuclear option, a drastic step. There are, though, people who say it's necessary now to send a message to Orbán that his behaviour is not acceptable.

Marc Filippino

All right, we'll keep an eye out for what's going to happen in today's summit and what will happen with Orbán in the EU. Ben Hall is the FT's Europe editor. Thanks, Ben.

Boeing was pretty tight-lipped yesterday about how a mid-flight incident in January will impact the company's finances. The aircraft manufacturer did not issue a financial forecast for this year. Instead, Boeing said it needs to focus on safety after a door plug came off one of its planes. I'm joined now by the FT's Steff Chavez. She covers Boeing. Hey, Steff.

Steff Chavez

Hi, Marc.

Marc Filippino

All right, so how significant is it that Boeing decided not to release its financial forecast for the year?

Steff Chavez

It's ultimately not surprising given the chaos that's been going on with the company. But it is significant. Boeing is a publicly traded company, and those companies tend to provide an annual forecast at the start of each year. So when a company pulls its guidance, or in this case, delays it, clearly something is up. It has to be very significant for a company to do that.

Marc Filippino

Yeah. And companies usually give financial guidance for the year when they report their fourth-quarter earnings like Boeing did yesterday. Steff, when you listened in on the earnings call, were you able to glean anything regarding Boeing's current financial situation?

Steff Chavez

Boeing did not give any sense on its call yesterday about how much the Max 9 incident will cost. Now that the FAA has limited the number of Maxes it can produce per month, the Max production is really key for Boeing to hit its longer-term financial and delivery targets. The biggest takeaway was that Boeing was trying to project that safety is their absolute priority right now. CEO Dave Calhoun struck an apologetic tone during the earnings call.

Dave Calhoun voice clip

I know that these moments that impact delivery schedules can frustrate our customers and our investors. But quality and safety must come above all else.

Steff Chavez

You know, he said, that Boeing caused the issue and that Boeing needs to restore confidence.

Dave Calhoun voice clip

We will simply focus on every next aeroplane and ensure we meet all the standards that we have, all the standards that our regulator has and that our customers demand.

Steff Chavez

And the other thing that I think they're trying to do is the company, since 2018 and 2019 when there were two fatal crashes, like that was an absolute catastrophe. You know, at the time, they initially tried to blame the pilots of their, of the planes that crashed, for example, and that CEO was eventually booted out of the company. So I think that Boeing and Dave Calhoun are trying to stand in contrast to that response.

Marc Filippino

So the other thing I found really interesting was Boeing's share price. I mean, it was up nearly 6 per cent at one point yesterday. Why were investors so enthusiastic, considering all the bad stuff that's happening at the aircraft maker right now?

Steff Chavez

I mean, it seems like they were receptive to Calhoun's messaging, ultimately, and, you know, the company is messaging. I think investors are just also betting, in the long run, that Boeing will come through. It's going to take a lot of time. If you think about it, they still weren't fully recovered from the 2018, 2019 crash crisis, and now they have this next crisis. So it does take a long time, but they're probably betting that in the end, Boeing will pull through.

Marc Filippino

What comes next for Boeing? Anything that you're keeping an eye out for?

Steff Chavez

The next big thing is the report from the National Transportation Safety Board that could come any day now. That should detail what exactly caused that door plug to blow out of the plane while it was at 16,000ft. It should be able to tell us where the production mistake happened: under Boeing's direct watch or whether it happened under the watch of Spirit AeroSystems, which is the Boeing supplier that makes the fuselage for the Max planes?

2024-02-01,Bill Ready: why social media turned toxic and how we can fix it,"Bill Ready is the chief executive of Pinterest, the image-sharing platform known for its creative and quirky user base, whose photos of home decor, food, weddings and more comprise what the company calls the ""best ideas . . . for all of life's moments"".

When Ready took the role in June 2022, he walked into a period of upheaval for tech stocks: an advertising slump, macroeconomic turmoil, and sector job cuts. At the same time, social media companies were battling a wave of criticism from politicians and the public, who felt that they prioritised profit over safety, hooking users with algorithmically curated content curation and online popularity contests -- all while harvesting their data.

Today, those fears have only intensified as platforms such as Elon Musk's X have cut back on their moderation policies and resources, citing the imperative of free speech.

But Ready -- previously an entrepreneur, PayPal's chief operating officer and president of commerce at Google -- claims social media can be a kinder place. In conversation with the FT's technology correspondent, Hannah Murphy, he talks about his vision for a less toxic platform that can use artificial intelligence (AI) for good, but still grow, make money, and satisfy activist investors.

Hannah Murphy: When Pinterest first went public, I described it in the FT as the world's most wholesome social media platform. Do you think that's accurate? Does Pinterest still intend to be this wholesome place?

Bill Ready: Absolutely, yes. In fact, that's one of the biggest things that attracted me to Pinterest when I joined. One of the things that I really want to do here is to prove a different business model for social media, one built on positivity.

While that was an attribute of the platform previously, we're really doubling down on that, because we want to give consumers a real choice in where they spend their time. Social media has been delivering engagement where content that triggers you -- things that will get you to keep watching -- rises to the top. We're taking a very different approach, where we consciously choose to tune our AI for positivity, to show things that will help people feel better, feel more uplifted, take more real-world action in their life.

HM: Is that the answer, the tuning of the AI? How do you rid your platform of toxicity, then?

BR: Yes, it is. This question of tuning AI is central to how social media became so toxic. Think about how your own social media world has evolved over the past decade. When social media started out, it was a chronological view of what your friends posted, right?

HM: Yes.

BR: And, over time, it more and more became a view of what the algorithms thought you should see. The AI was told to maximise your view time, and it figured out that the things that would make you watch the longest were the ones that triggered you the most -- whether it was the politician that really got you fired up, or whether it was things that made you covet somebody else's fake perfect life.

As human beings, we're still wired the same way we were 100,000 years ago, when your brain was given a choice. Which thing should you pay more attention to? The thing that could be a nice lunch, or the thing that could make you [its] lunch? And, obviously, the thing that could make you [its] lunch required more of your attention. Things that drive fear, anger, envy, greed will grab the base of your brainstem, and the AI figured that out.

The way that we're approaching creating a more positive place on the internet is twofold. It's, one, tuning the AI specifically for positivity -- not just for maximising view time, but also for maximising emotional wellbeing, for making people feel better, not worse. And, two, part of what we think is imperative is mixing in more conscious choice from users.

What we found on our platform, when it was starting to incorporate more short-form video, was that [it was] maximising for view time. And what was rising to the top? The same triggering, made-you-look content that you would see on other platforms.

And we said, OK, how do we make sure that we're tuning for positivity? One of the things that we found was that, if we set the AI to tune more for explicit signals -- things like saves, or click to purchase, or what users were actually choosing to go look at -- all of a sudden, users would choose those in terms of outcomes. Instead of triggering content rising to the top, it was self-help and do-it-yourself videos, and things that were related to people's passions and interests -- whether fashion, or beauty, or music.

The metaphor I use for this is that it's like driving down the road and approaching a car crash up ahead. We all know you shouldn't look, right? But everybody peeks. With algorithmically derived feeds, the AI says: ""You looked, [so] I should show you another car crash. And you looked at that one, too. [So] I should show you another car crash. You looked at that one, too . . . "" Until, eventually, your feed is filled with nothing but car crashes. That is what has happened with social media.

But, if you ask somebody after they saw the car crash, ""You want to see another one of those?"" The vast majority of people will say, ""Goodness, no, that was terrible.""

HM: The reason platforms have evolved to encourage toxicity is because it's effective: it delivers more time for showing adverts, and we like these grabby things. So how convincing is a business model based on positivity? Is it that you attract a different audience? Or is it that, if people aren't led down the rabbit hole, they won't choose to go down it, and they'll just generally be happy, and you can lead the way?

BR: Yes, that's it. The great thing is we are already seeing this cut through, with both consumers and advertisers.

Gen Z has become the largest, fastest-growing demographic on our platform, and one of the key reasons Gen Z cites is that it sees Pinterest as an oasis away from the toxicity of the rest of social media.

And advertisers are becoming more aware that so much of what's driving the view time on a lot of social media is negative content, and are increasingly looking for brand-safe environments. The vast majority of brands are built on positivity, and so we're seeing a more positive platform resonate with advertisers.

The last thing I'd say on this is that we are a much more action-oriented platform than others. In most of social media, it's entertainment-based, using a lean-back consumption mode. On Pinterest, people come with intent and purpose, in a lean-forward mode, whether it's to make or to do or to buy.

HM: Obviously, you've had Elon Musk's X going in quite a different direction, with Musk suggesting that free speech and moderation are at odds with one another. Is free speech a consideration that comes into play for you, or not so much because of the format of the platform?

BR: Social media has really started to consume all of media. And a big thing that has shifted is that, even 10 years ago, 15 years ago, consumers made explicit choices in the media they were going to consume. If somebody wanted to turn on a 24-hour news channel and listen to people shout about politics, or wanted to put on family-friendly content, they could make an explicit choice to do that.

If social media becomes the vast majority of your media consumption, you have lost that choice. On most platforms, your only choice is to swipe, to continue scrolling.

In the same way that, in the prior media world, people could choose what channel they tuned into, we want to bring that choice to social media . . . [When they say] I want to go to a place that helps me invest in myself . . . I want to go to a place where I don't have to perform for others and try to show off a fake perfect life, we want them to know that Pinterest is that place.

And, to be that place, it means we consciously don't bring politics into the platform. For example, we don't allow political advertisements. We're making real business choices to say, yes, we don't want that revenue, we think there's different revenue that we'd rather have.

HM: How is that working with advertisers?

BR: Back at Cannes Lions [an annual festival for the advertising and communications industries, held in June], we launched the Inspired Internet Pledge, in which there were two things that we were doing.

One of them was saying that social media has to drive more change. There's been all this talk of tactics -- but, at the end of the day, do people feel better or worse after they spend time on your platform? That's what we called on the social media industry to do, and we said, ""Hey, we will raise our hands and go first -- we are going to measure emotional wellbeing outcomes, and we are committed to better outcomes over time.""

The second thing we did is, we called on the advertisers to vote with their dollars -- and, by the way, not just vote for us. Hold us accountable; hold the whole industry accountable for more positivity. And I think there's good signs of progress: you do see more and more advertisers being quite conscious of where they spend their dollars. Advertisers need to be more accountable than they have been because, if you look at much of the toxicity of social media, advertisers continue to fund a lot of these platforms.

HM: At the moment, there's a lot of bipartisan concern about teen wellbeing and child safety. How are you addressing those fears? Surely the hunt to get young users hooked on a platform as soon as possible, as part of running a profitable business, is at odds with caring for their wellbeing?

BR: Yes, these things are at odds -- until consumers and parents have an alternative. We've seen this play out over and over again. To draw a parallel from another industry, think back to [US consumer advocate] Ralph Nader's Unsafe at Any Speed [a 1965 book accusing carmakers of neglecting safety].

You had most of the auto industry advocating that safety belts were against the business model, right? [But then] not only did you have regulatory and public outcry, you also started to have car companies [taking action]: Volvo comes along and invents the three-point safety belt, then starts to build a brand and differentiation on safety. All of a sudden, consumers had choices and, now, every auto manufacturer competes on safety. I hope that can be a future state for social media.

HM: You want to be the Volvo of socials?

BR: Yes, it only takes one to change an industry, right? I hope not only that we can differentiate ourselves on it, but that safety can start to become an aspect that the industry competes on.

To your point of business model, I do think this is a place where we see platforms making very different choices. If you take teen safety, it's always the case that there's going to be bad actors that try to exploit platforms. Then the question is, what do you do to combat it?

On the teen safety front, earlier this year, we moved to private-by-default for users under 18. For users under 16, it is private-only -- not just private-by-default. Of course, that took away some engagement and revenue in the short term. But we were willing to make that trade because we felt that, in the long term, not only was it morally the right thing to do [but we can] build the business on safety -- it can be a real differentiator for the business.

HM: You mentioned the ecommerce side earlier. Many of your rivals -- Instagram, Snap -- pushed deeper during the pandemic into ecommerce with mixed results, and have pulled back somewhat. It feels like western social media hasn't quite nailed shopping properly -- is it fair to say that?

BR: Yes, I think that's fair to say across social media, broadly. This was one of the things that I found so compelling about the opportunity to join Pinterest.

Part of why social media has really struggled to solve for shopping is that it's exceptionally difficult, darn near impossible, to change the mode that a user's in: to get the user to go from lean-back to lean-forward. One of the things that I found really compelling about Pinterest is that the user is in that lean-forward mode. More than half the people on Pinterest say they are there to shop.

The thing that needed to be solved for Pinterest was that, in a lot of ways, Pinterest had solved digital window shopping, but all the stores were closed: you couldn't take action on the things that you would find. And as we've been bringing that actionability on to the platform, we've been seeing that work really well with users, whether you measure that by clicks or conversions.

HM: Inevitably, I'd like to ask about AI. How have you taken advantage of recent advances?

BR: AI is a core competency for us. We have made phenomenal progress over the past 18 months, leveraging next-gen AI on multiple fronts, including pairing it with the human curation that happens on our platform -- people making product associations and saying this handbag goes with this dress and these shoes. That becomes a really rich signal for the AI to know better and better what's going to be a fashionable outfit for the user.

I'll give you a few tangible examples. When we recommend something and go, 'We think you'd like this, or we think you'd like that', we're now getting a 95 per cent relevancy score with users. That's up a full 10 per cent in the last year, and that's really been based on next-gen AI. Our large language models that we're using, our relevancy models, are now more than 100 times larger than they were just a year ago.

Another place where we've made progress with AI is on our ad platform, where we're getting to the ads being more and more relevant for the users.

And the last example I'd cite, and, in fact, the most important one, is trust and safety. One of the things I'm most proud of is that, over the past 18 months, we've proven that it is possible to tune the AI for positivity, to lead to better emotional wellbeing.

There's a bunch of other elements within that. [On body type] we're helping to show a more representative sample of what the real population actually looks like in our feed, so people don't get so locked into the idea that there's only one ideal of perfection. We've seen that with our skin tone diversity, too.

And we've made tremendous progress over multiple years on using AI to detect harmful content and to remove it. We're also seeing that we can move beyond just the most harmful content, and towards things like depressing content, depressive quotes, things like that.

There, we found that we could use next-gen AI to [identify] things that may be sad or depressing -- and not to prevent people from accessing them, because sometimes that's OK, sometimes a great sad song lets you have a cry and work through emotions. But, when it becomes all you see, and you get taken down a rabbit hole, it can become overwhelming.

People can explore some of these things, but we can also bring in more uplifting content. And, if it's really moving down that path, we can make sure we're providing emotional wellbeing support tools, or the ability for users to find professional help.

HM: You used the phrase ""next-gen AI"". Is that different from generative AI? What do you mean by next-gen AI?

BR: These things get conflated a bit. The core technology is the same, and what gets a lot of attention is the generative part -- where I can ask it to paint a picture for me, or I can have a conversation with it.

But you can also use that same technology [in other ways]. In the first phase of AI, so much of the value accrued to the [large language] model creators. I think, in the next phase, value is going to accrue to others, in the same way it did with cloud computing. Basically, cloud computing made it so that really complicated computing functions became building blocks that were available to anybody and, then, people could assemble those building blocks in different ways.

The first LLMs are going to be made available to everybody and, then, the next wave of value will be less about the model builder, and more about who has a unique signal to feed the AI. We have both our own LLMs that we have created, as well as LLMs that others have built -- and, then, we are using signals that are proprietary to our platform, to create different outcomes: things like better relevancy for shopping recommendations, or more ability to spot depressing content.

HM: Is a Pinterest chatbot on the horizon?

BR: At its core, Pinterest is a visual search and discovery platform, and so we are much more focused on the visual nature of the interaction. Often, people lack the words to describe the thing that they're looking for, right?

Think about the way you'd shop in the real world. If you walked into a boutique, and there was a good associate working there, would you say: ""I'm looking for a dress in exactly this style, with exactly this aesthetic, and then I want a handbag with this aesthetic and shoes with this aesthetic?""

Or would you be more likely to say: ""I'm looking for a great outfit for a holiday party, and I want it to feel like this""? [You would probably use] those general descriptors, and the visual nature of our platform helps people explore what they don't have words for. Therefore, we don't see a chatbot as the right modality.

HM: Looking beyond Pinterest at the social media space more generally, is AI going to make social media better or worse? In five years from now, where do you see us?

BR: As with any technology, AI can be used for good or for bad, and even more often it can lead to unintended consequences, if you aren't thoughtful about it.

So you will see examples of all three of those things. You'll see examples of AI used for good, and we are extremely focused in that category. And you will see, and are already seeing, AI used for nefarious purposes -- all the more reason for tightening up trust and safety.

[More common still will be] people who have not been thoughtful and intentional in using AI, which leaves you exposed to unintended consequences. That's been the story of social media for the last decade.

HM: I'd like to ask about one of your investors, Elliott Investment Management, with which you've had a long-term co-operation agreement since 2022, including a seat on the board. Pinterest may be a very wholesome platform, but Elliott is hardly famous for being soft and fluffy. How is it shaping your strategy?

BR: They've actually been a great partner. One of the things I talked about at the beginning is that I intend to prove that there's a real business model built on positivity in social media, and that we can do well by doing good.

Think about electric vehicles. It's not that long ago that most car companies were funding climate misinformation, or spoofing emissions tests. And, now, every car company is pushing their electric vehicles. What changed? It wasn't a change in morality. It was, all of a sudden, the fact that electric vehicles are more profitable per unit than combustion engine vehicles. There's a good business model in electric vehicles and, now, you have a whole industry moving in that direction. That's what I hope can happen in social media.

We shared this with our investors. Our most recent user cohorts are our most engaged -- in fact, by nearly twofold, which is almost unheard-of in product development. Normally, you start out with your power users and, over the years, each successive cohort's a little less engaged.

So, for our broader investor community, we are showing that positivity for social media doesn't have to just be charitable, it can be a good business model. And that can actually change an industry. I would love that to be the outcome of our work.

HM: I have one final question, just to pick up on that. I hear the pitch. I hear the mission, loud and clear. What's working against you? What are the challenges going forward?

BR: The challenges are that it is a hypercompetitive space and there are plenty of people who're still maximising view time, plenty of people who're going to throw caution to the wind on AI, plenty of people who, when they see bad actors on their platform, are not going to sacrifice some growth to do the right things for users.

Those things can create tough competitive dynamics. But my hope is that the more we show there's a real alternative, the more users and advertisers will make a more conscious choice. By no means can we say mission accomplished yet -- but I think we have proven it's possible. My hope is that we can get an industry rallied behind it, but that's years and years of work ahead.","Pinterest ceo Bill Ready says social media is the world's most wholesome social media platform.

2024-02-01,Viktor Orbán: what is the endgame for Europe's chief disrupter?,"Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

Viktor Orbán was asked on Hungarian TV late last year whether his antagonism towards Brussels and Washington would lead Hungary away from the west and out of the EU.

""Our plan is not to leave the EU,"" he replied. ""Our plan is to conquer it.""

Orbán was speaking shortly after he vetoed an €50bn EU aid package for Ukraine at a summit in December. EU leaders will convene again in Brussels on Thursday to try to persuade him to back down.

The Hungarian premier is more isolated than ever, say EU officials. But Orbán is convinced that politics is shifting to the right on both sides of the Atlantic, favouring his agenda. He told Hungarian TV that the EU would come round to his way of thinking -- that it should be pressing Ukraine to negotiate with Russia, not supporting its resistance -- just as he believes it did on immigration.

Unless he softens his stance, Orbán will face the wrath of European leaders, exasperated by his increasingly obstructionist tactics in both the EU and Nato.

Diplomats say he relishes being centre stage. The shrewd negotiator has a long history of blocking EU decisions to extract concessions. But the greater Orbán's intransigence, the more uncertain European diplomats and officials seem about his objectives -- and his price.

One view is that he is once again trying to force Brussels to release money for Hungary that remains frozen over concerns about the country's rule of law and anti-corruption measures.

""This is primarily about blackmail, leverage and unblocking his money,"" says a senior EU diplomat.

Others suspect Orbán wants to go further and undermine EU institutions that constrain his actions, particularly the European Commission and its president, Ursula von der Leyen.

Not that Orbán appears deterred by EU concerns over the state of Hungarian democracy and the rule of law.

On the same day as EU leaders convene, a new Sovereignty Protection Authority starts work in Budapest, with the aim of rooting out foreign influence in politics, academia and the media. It is the latest step in the Hungarian leader's decade-long project curtailing political freedoms and legal rights.

The body has sweeping investigative powers and no judicial oversight. Its legal basis is ""so vague that the invasive scrutiny of the proposed office could be weaponised against anybody who may be considered an adversary due, for instance, to 'activities aimed at influencing democratic debate'"", the Council of Europe, the continent's rights watchdog, warned in November.

""If anyone is perceived to endanger sovereignty, such as me talking to you right now and saying the EU should send no money [to Hungary], they could become subjects of the deepest investigations without any kind of legal oversight or the ability to complain,"" says Ákos Hadházy, an independent MP and former member of Orbán's Fidesz party turned critic.

""Now . . . it is blatantly clear for everybody why it is a problem to cultivate autocrats inside Europe, why it is a challenge not only for the people of certain countries, but for all people in the European Union,"" says Katalin Cseh, a Hungarian opposition member of the European parliament.

Orbán insists that Hungary's political system is more open than other countries -- he highlights as evidence the legal proceedings that Donald Trump faces in the US and alleged surveillance of the far-right Alternative for Germany party. ""No one can seriously think that the way we lead this country is any worse than [the west],"" he told Hungarian TV.

To his European and US allies, Orban's has crossed a rubicon by blocking EU financial and military aid for Ukraine and for holding back on ratifying Nato membership first for Finland and now Sweden. They accuse him of acting against their fundamental foreign policy interests at a time of war on the continent, and even of doing the Kremlin's bidding.

One EU diplomat says vetoing aid for Ukraine is ""the final straw"". Orbán's past behaviour was ""political posturing . . . This has an impact in the real world.""

In an interview with the Financial Times, the US ambassador to Hungary, David Pressman, is unusually blunt. ""This government is not listening to or engaging with us in a productive dialogue on issues that are core to the US national security interests,"" he says.

The Hungarian premier is friendly towards Moscow and broke ranks last October by becoming the first EU leader to meet Vladimir Putin since the Russian president ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Budapest's relations with Kyiv have been poor for years, partly over the issue of minority rights for ethnic Hungarians living in western Ukraine. It has blocked Nato-Ukraine co-operation since 2017.

Whatever his intentions, Pressman says, Orbán's policy choices are ""helpful to Putin and harmful to careful efforts to keep the alliance and our partners together"".

Such is the exasperation with Orbán's stubbornness that Hungary's partners have sought ways to retaliate.

Officials in Brussels last week drew up a plan to punish his ""unconstructive behaviour"" in which member states would rule out any further EU funding for Hungary with the aim of undermining confidence in the Hungarian economy. Budapest said it was EU ""blackmail"".

Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson hinted that a Hungarian lease of 14 Gripen fighter jets -- which account for the entire fixed-wing combat section of Hungary's air force -- could be at stake if Budapest continued to block Sweden's path into Nato.

European diplomats say there has been discussion in several capitals of triggering the EU's so-called Article 7 sanction, which can ultimately result in the suspension of a member state's voting rights, the heaviest punishment possible. Others have rebuffed such a step, given that it requires unanimous support from its members and many countries are reluctant to deploy such a tool.

Daniel Hegedüs, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund think-tank, says member states should at least initiate the first phase of the procedure, which only requires a fourth-fifths majority ""if the goal is to give the message to the Hungarians that you have to change your behaviour. If nothing else it is naming and shaming.""

The defeat of the Eurosceptic but pro-Ukrainian government in Poland following elections last year has left Orbán more isolated than ever, say officials and diplomats. He has a potential ally in Robert Fico, the populist prime minister of Slovakia who returned to power last year and has voiced pro-Russian leanings. But although the Slovak premier raises rule of law concerns of his own, he appears more flexible than his Hungarian counterpart, and changed his stance on Ukraine following a visit to the war-torn country earlier this month.

Before the EU summit in Brussels in December -- where Orbán took a one-man stand against helping Ukraine -- the Hungarians proposed to Fico that the two leaders arrive together and give a joint statement to the press. Fico refused, according to people briefed on the discussions, and proceeded to contradict Orbán's arguments in the room.

""Orbán came to [the December summit] expecting to find silent allies around the [European Commission] table who would emerge and say, 'Viktor has a point here,'"" says a senior European diplomat. ""But none emerged.""

Orbán's allies brush off his apparent isolation.

""This is not a position that we enjoy,"" says János Bóka, Orbán's EU minister and a former adviser on Europe. However, he says, ""being alone . . . in the European Union is not something that prevents the Hungarian government from pursuing a specific position. In Hungary, our political community expects the Hungarian government to be firm and uncompromising on national interests.""

On the contrary, the Hungarian government sees the balance of power tilting in its favour this year, with the strong possibility of Trump's return to the White House and gains for the populist, nationalist right and far right in European parliamentary elections in June and several other national polls supporting its Eurosceptic positions.

This will be a ""year of political opportunity"" for Hungary, says Bóka.

Orbán will do everything to take it.

Ironically for someone who decries foreign interference in his country's affairs, the Hungarian leader is not afraid to directly intervene in politics elsewhere. France's far-right National Rally party received a loan from a Hungarian bank run by Orbán associates. The Hungarian government is reported to have funded anti-immigration adverts in Polish ahead of last year's election. Protests by farmers against the EU in Brussels last week were organised by a Hungarian think-tank chaired by a close aide to the prime minister.

As the US gears up for elections, Orbán is openly advocating Trump's return to the White House while denigrating the Biden administration, says ambassador Pressman.

""I am sure that if President Trump were president, then today Ukraine and Europe would not be stricken by any kind of war,"" Orbán told a Republican-aligned Conservative Political Action Conference in Hungary last May. ""Come back Mr President, make America great again and bring us peace!""

In Europe, Orbán is a keen student of political developments across the continent, even conducting surveys in all other EU member states to understand political dynamics. According to close allies, the Hungarian leader has watched the slide in support for mainstream parties in Germany and elsewhere in the EU and is betting that voters will end up wanting things such as energy links with Russia restored and better social protections, rather than spending on Ukrainians or immigrants.

Orbán sees ""a very large playground among all the people who have now found themselves outside the old dual order [of established parties]"", says one person with knowledge of the premier's thinking.

The polls in Europe put right-wing parties in a strong position. Surveys suggest the nationalist European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), led by Italy's Giorgia Meloni, and the more radical Identity and Democracy Group (ID), home to the French and German far-right parties, will gain ground in June's European parliament elections at the expense of the greens and liberals.

Their gains would be enough to shift parliament to more conservative positions on environmental legislation and laws on immigration and asylum, according to a study by the European Council on Foreign Relations.

Orbán dreams of uniting ID and ECR into one large Eurosceptic bloc but the two groups remain deeply divided between relative moderates and extremists and over the question of support for Russia. His party, Fidesz, which was forced out of the mainstream conservative family in 2021, is a member of neither but would be a natural fit for the ECR, were it not for its position on Ukraine and Russia.

The Hungarian leader believes the upcoming European parliament elections will signal a new political order in Europe following the far-right's victory in last year's Dutch elections and probably later this year in Austria. His calculation, say allies, is that within a few years he will never be alone again in the European Council.

In the meantime, Hungary will press for a looser, less integrated EU, says Bóka, an objective that unites all Eurosceptic parties in Europe.

""We need a Brussels that stands up for the self-esteem of nations, allows countries to choose their way of life, regulates the market but won't tell a Pole, a Hungarian or a Portuguese how they should live,"" Orbán told Hungarian TV.

Indeed, several EU officials involved in the discussions with Hungary say the aim of Orbán's confrontational tactics has been to erode the commission's standing and its rule of law safeguards.

""This is about a sustained campaign to shift power from Brussels to the member states,"" says one senior EU diplomat involved in the negotiations with Hungary. ""That's his game plan.""

""The commission is a giant compromise machine,"" the diplomat adds. ""And it was designed to work with countries who play by the rules. Hungary does not play by the rules.""

Shortly before he wielded his veto against the Ukraine support package in December, the commission released €10bn in blocked funding following legal changes by Hungary to strengthen judicial independence. The commission said it could have faced legal action if it had not released the money given that Budapest had acquiesced to the concessions Brussels had requested.

But the release of EU funds was hugely contentious with Orbán's domestic opponents and his critics in the European parliament, who are threatening legal action against the commission.

""We cannot expect Hungary to return to the rule of law through narrow and technical changes,"" says Katalin Cseh, an opposition MEP. ""It was very clear that the justice reforms . . . weren't complete, the guarantees were not there.""

Cseh points out that Brussels released the €10bn in frozen funds less than 24 hours after the final judicial reform was passed into law by Hungary's parliament, hardly time for proper scrutiny.

Any further compromise by Brussels could damage the credibility of the conditionality mechanism, a tool used against Hungary in 2022, and the standing of von der Leyen in the eyes of MEPs and national leaders. She requires the backing of both to win a second five-year mandate at the top of the commission this autumn.

Orbán opposes a second term for von der Leyen and has vilified her in campaign posters plastered around Budapest and other cities. Undermining her is a critical part of his anti-Brussels campaign, officials say.

""He is playing a very long game, and has more time than most,"" says a second EU diplomat present during the summit talks. ""Quite honestly, he is better at playing the game than most, too.""

Orbán's opponents reject the idea that there is some higher ideological or even foreign policy purpose to his obstructive behaviour in Brussels. Everything, they say, is about keeping control in Hungary through politicised public institutions and crony capitalism, a system he has dubbed the System of National Cooperation -- one that requires the continued flow of EU funds.

Confrontation with Brussels serves to polarise the electorate, turn the opposition into enemies and deflects attention from real problems, such as Hungary's weak economy, says independent MP Hadházy.

""It is not about conviction or ideology. It is about preservation of power,"" he says.

""If everyone's against him, then back home he's a freedom fighter, at least to his voters,"" says Ágnes Vadai, an opposition MP. ""He's not pro-Russia, he's not pro-Putin; he's pro the Putin system.""",EU leaders will convene again in Brussels on Thursday to try to persuade Viktor Orbán to back down.

2024-02-01,EU leaders gather for showdown with Viktor Orbán on Ukraine,"Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

EU leaders will make a final attempt on Thursday to coerce Viktor Orbán into agreeing vital aid for Kyiv, as ties between Brussels and Budapest are at breaking point and officials fear an irreparable rupture within the bloc if the Hungarian prime minister maintains his veto.

A summit in Brussels will seek to secure €50bn over four years for Ukraine at a crucial moment nearly two years into Russia's full-scale invasion -- funding that cannot be approved unless Orbán agrees to it. The 26 other EU countries could find funding solutions circumventing Hungary, but they are more costly and time-consuming than using the common budget.

Orbán's refusal to budge in recent months has led the bloc to test different approaches, from offering financial incentives to exploring the economic consequences of a complete cut-off from EU funding, and prompted discussions among some member state officials about the possibility of stripping Budapest of its voting rights.

""We are doomed to unanimity,"" said one EU official involved in the negotiations. ""[And] many member states see this question of the war in Ukraine as existential.""

The EU funds for Ukraine, first proposed in June, have risen in importance as the US Congress has failed to pass a $60bn aid package for Kyiv and as Russia has amplified its attacks on Ukrainian cities.

The Hungarian leader's continued resistance to approve the package and his pro-Russia, Eurosceptic policies have exacerbated frustrations among a majority of EU capitals.

""It is not about Ukraine, in my view . . . Orbán is using this opportunity to blackmail the institutions and the rest of the EU,"" said a senior EU diplomat. ""If it might also coincide with his pro-Russia agenda, and further down the road he can derail the whole thing, then even better.""

In negotiations on Wednesday, Hungary's ambassador to the EU rejected a last-minute compromise offered by the bloc, arguing that it fell short of Budapest's demand to be able to continue to wield veto powers each year -- something the other capitals have ruled out.

That olive branch came days after the Financial Times reported about a draft analysis that outlined how the Hungarian economy would be hurt if all EU funds would be cut off in an attempt to strong-arm Orbán. Following the report, Hungary's currency fell in value and its debt prices rose.

An official at the European Council, the institution that produced the document, said it ""does not outline a plan but makes a suggestion"".

But its publication ""was useful to add pressure"" on Orbán, one EU diplomat said, adding that there were hopes European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen ""has something in her pocket"" at the summit.

Diplomats involved in the last-minute negotiations on the eve of the meeting said it was impossible to predict its outcome, given Orbán's history of making deals around the summit table.

Some capitals have also revived discussions about voting rights, which can be stripped based on a process known as article 7 of the EU treaty, but which requires unanimity of the other 26 countries.

Kaja Kallas, Estonia's prime minister, acknowledged ""growing frustration"" with Orbán and that ""there is talk of using article 7"", but not as a ""first option"".

Instead, Hungarians ""have bigger risks that are related to the economy"", she said. ""They need the belief of European investors in Hungary being inside this bigger European market. So the key is somewhere in the economical part.""",EU leaders will try to coerce Viktor Orbán into agreeing vital aid for Kyiv.

2024-02-01,Franklin CEO says ETFs will probably cannibalise some mutual funds,"Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools

Franklin Templeton's exchange traded funds attracted about $1bn in net inflows in the three months to December 31, lifting total ETF assets to $20bn, 40 per cent higher than a year earlier.

""ETFs are incredibly important to us,"" Franklin chief executive officer Jenny Johnson said during a call with analysts to discuss the firm's earnings.

It was the fifth consecutive quarter in which flows to Franklin's ETFs have totalled about $1bn.

The firm's ETFs, the first of which launched in 2013, would ""probably cannibalise some of the mutual funds"", Johnson said, but mutual funds would remain popular in the retirement channel, she added.

""As we grow [retirement sales], we're able to make up for any of that cannibalisation in that retirement channel while also growing our ETFs,"" Johnson said.

Investors pulled $33bn from Franklin's mutual funds in 2023, down from nearly $50bn in 2022, Morningstar Direct data shows.

The firm's mutual funds have experienced net outflows totalling $278bn from 2015 to 2023. Despite market appreciation of the underlying holdings, assets declined by 24 per cent from year-end 2014, to $406bn as of the end of 2023, according to Morningstar Direct.

Franklin gained about $148bn in assets from its January 1 acquisition of Putnam, about 30 per cent of which was retirement related, Adam Spector, the firm's head of global distribution, said during the call.

Putnam had about $18bn in stable value products, as well as target-date products, Spector noted.

""We can now play in that segment where we haven't really been able to play effectively historically,"" he said. ""So, from a product standpoint, we're in a much stronger position.""

Franklin had also added some retirement sales muscle from Putnam, he said. ""[W]hen we took folks in from Putnam, one of the areas where we added most significantly . . . [was] retirement and somewhat in the insurance channel as well,"" Spector said. ""So, we just have a much, much larger field force.""

Franklin expected cost savings from the Putnam acquisition of $85mn to $100mn for the nine-month period ended September 30, according to chief financial officer Matthew Nicholls. The firm expected annual savings from the acquisition to reach $150mn in early 2025, he said.

Franklin reported $417mn in adjusted operating income for the last three months of 2023, down 18.5 per cent from the prior quarter and up 5.5 per cent from the year-earlier quarter.

The firm's adjusted operating expenses were $1.1bn, up 4 per cent from the prior quarter and 6.5 per cent from the year-earlier quarter. The increase was mostly due to higher adjusted pay and benefits, according to the company's earnings commentary.","Franklin Templeton's exchange traded funds attracted about $1bn in net inflows in the three months to December 31.

2024-02-01,Europe's financial sector is a drag,"Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

The writer is a former chief investment strategist at Bridgewater Associates

European equity markets are starting 2024 following a familiar pattern: underperforming US peers in local currency terms. Between 2009 and 2023, such underperformance resulted in cumulative S&P 500 gains that were five times those of Euro Stoxx 50.

Such US equity exceptionalism has not always been the case. In the two decades leading up to 2009, US and European equity returns were much more similar. Investors should look back to understand what changed this relationship and how those factors may evolve in the future.

By now it is well known that advances in technology and big US tech stocks were a key driver in the last decade's outsized US market gains. Investors are also aware of several other factors weighing down relatively more on European economic and market performance. The list includes the Ukraine war, more limited post-pandemic stimulus, slowing trade with China, and going further back, the hit from the European debt crisis and a subsequent recovery constrained by a pact on national spending.

There is yet another structural cause of European underperformance that seems likely to persist: Europe's financial sector. This is not about regional bank stock performance. Rather, Europe's relatively narrow and fragmented financial industry is like a weak financial heart that struggles to pump sufficient capital and liquidity to support healthy European companies and economic growth.

The gap between US and European financial sectors has widened steadily since the 2008-2009 crisis, after which banking regulations were notably tightened. Indeed, the total market capitalisation of European banks (including the UK and Switzerland) fell from $2.7tn in 2007 to $1.4tn by 2021, according to a recent study by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a think-tank. Europe's decline is even more striking when compared with the increase in US bank market capitalisation: from $1.6tn to $2.6tn. Asset management firms saw even greater divergence over the same period, with Europe's asset management sector losing market share, partly to what is now a globally dominant US.

While size does not guarantee relatively stronger market returns or respective economic growth, it definitely helps firms more easily absorb costs tied to changing regulatory requirements and technology needs. The size and breadth of US financial firms also create a positive feedback loop with capital markets that support a more robust ecosystem over the business cycle. Larger, healthy banks can extend more credit, which supports companies and overall economic growth. That economic growth, in turn, creates a positive backdrop for households and businesses to invest, which both benefits the banks but also spurs development of capital markets and non-bank financial firms. Those non-bank options provide more choices of investment and financing -- something particularly helpful when macro conditions or regulations lead banks to moderate lending temporarily, as was seen last year.

Tighter regulations after 2008 are far from alone in holding European finance back. Cultural and political issues have contributed as well. Despite successfully launching a single market and currency, European politicians have so far failed to transform a decade of discussions into effective banking and capital market unions.

Lack of agreement by policymakers has often stemmed from different voter priorities. Indeed, the past year or so has seen a handful of European governments look to banks as a source of fiscal funding for those priorities rather than a key growth driver. For example, Italy, Spain, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Lithuania have put forward new taxes on banks, despite a warning from the European Central Bank that ""the amount of extraordinary tax might not be commensurate with the longer-term profitability of a credit institution and its capital generation capacity"".

The fragmented and more limited nature of Europe's financial sector is only one input that contributes to the short-term performance of European equities. As has been seen historically, Europe can still have months or even a few quarters of outperformance despite this drag.

However, sustained European outperformance will continue to be much more difficult to achieve without a stronger financial heartbeat, which in turn can help create stronger growth. There is ample research to support what the World Bank concluded in 2016: ""Countries with better-developed financial systems tend to grow faster over long periods of time.""","Europe's financial sector is like a weak financial heart that struggles to pump sufficient capital and liquidity.

""I'm obsessed with colour,"" says jewellery designer Solange Azagury-Partridge. Since she launched her eponymous label in 1990, rainbow colours have been her USP. In her west London office, walls range from sugary pink to zingy yellow; a gold-topped dining table sits on a multicoloured carpet; a fireplace glows with neon flames and pendant lights shimmer in grape-like bunches of red and green Swarovski crystals. Across the road, both her fine jewellery shop and its next-door little sister - home to the Hot Lips diffusion line - are fronted with eye-catching stained-glass panels.

""I've always thought that glass is like jewellery - precious, with an edible quality to it,"" says Azagury-Partridge. She has just released a series of Murano-glass table lights with Green Wolf Lighting. The collection of five designs - each produced in a limited edition of 1,000, and priced from £550 (abask.com) - is a new take on the brand's candle-like cordless design, first released in 2022. To the portable, USB-charged cylinders of handblown glass, Azagury-Partridge has added miniature lamp-worked sculptures. ""They're motifs that are always present in my work,"" she says of the intricately wrought Rainbow, Sun, Cloud, Home and Eden designs - the last of these a symbolic diorama of the Garden of Eden, with a central tree accompanied by an apple and a snake.

""I'm interested in how lighting can set a mood and ambience,"" says Green Wolf Lighting founder and creative director Rebecca Marks, a former film producer. The two women have known each other since the 1990s; together, they worked with four different Venetian workshops, because ""the cloud guy doesn't make the rainbow; that's a totally different technique"", says Marks.

Murano's glassmakers have long lent their skills and proprietary hues - secret formulations passed down from one generation to the next - to showstopping lighting. For designers today, the alchemy of light and coloured glass continues to enchant; in Venice and beyond.

Sophie Lou Jacobsen's Flora collection, in collaboration with design studio In Common With, was created with Brooklyn glassblower Adam Holtzinger using the centuries-old Italian fazzoletto technique; elegantly arching and undulating forms come in shades of lilac, pistachio, poppy and tobacco. In Brussels, Maarten De Ceulaer's multicoloured Stained Glass Lights are formed from swirling sheets of mouthblown glass. In Mexico City, Fabien Cappello has been combining geometric stained-glass-style construction with a vibrant palette, while Camilla Moberg works with Finnish glassblowers on her glowing strings and stacks of pebble-inspired shapes.

New York-based Dana Arbib worked with Murano specialists on her statement Rami Chandelier ($17,250) - a sprawling sea-creature-like lamp, its lurid yellow tentacles holding up ""bubbled"" sea-green shades. Drawing inspiration from Gio Ponti, it is the focal point of a lighting collection first shown at New York gallery Tiwa Select last September, which also includes the two-tone Suolo table lamp and the plant-like Fiorire Sconce - Arbib's favourite. ""Personally, I'm more attracted to neutral earth tones, but I'm trying to push myself towards brighter, more saturated colours,"" she says. ""And with a chandelier you do want to make a statement.""

""Glass comes alive when you put light in it,"" says London-based Italian designer Paola Petrobelli, a former molecular biologist who has worked with the same glassblowers in Murano since 1998. For the past 10 years, she has been creating striking lights from stackable moulded-glass elements, in a sweet-shop spectrum of transparent and opaque shades. ""I like thinking about how the different colours and shapes talk to each other,"" she says, citing inspirations from vintage Venini glassware to the designs of Ettore Sottsass and Carlo Scarpa. Last year, she featured in an exhibition with artist and designer Richard Woods, showing her modular forms alongside his graphic, handpainted ""tree stumps"": the collection swiftly sold out at a pop-up show at Siegfried Contemporary, Saanen. Most recently, her work has reached new heights, combining up to 12 individual pieces in totemic sculptures.

Many glass pieces function as artwork by day and light source by night. De Ceulaer refers to his lamps as ""radiating three-dimensional abstract paintings"". Brooklyn-based Jamie Harris calls himself an artist who makes ""painterly glass objects and sculptural lighting"". And while French artist Diane Benoit du Rey is best known for her luminous abstract oil paintings, her work shone in lamp form at Design Miami in December. The Lumèn columns, each 1.6m high, softly merge coloured lacquers to ""reflect Diane's painting research in sculpture"", says Galerie Scene Ouverte founder Laurence Bonnel.

Taiwan wants to be a frontrunner in offshore wind power, making the most of its high wind speeds. Clean energy is vital to the country's world-leading semiconductor industry, but developing new energy from scratch isn't easy. And in Taiwan geopolitical risks also loom.

Taiwan Strait has some of the best wind speeds in the world, helping attract international developers to put their wind turbines here. But developing offshore wind is also complicated and expensive, while in Taiwan the supply chains are underdeveloped. I've come here to the Taiwan Strait to find out can Taiwan get its offshore wind industry off the ground?

Taiwan currently relies on oil, coal, and gas for its energy, almost all of which is imported. The government wants to change that with ambitious goals to cut the country's carbon dioxide emissions to net zero by 2050. By 2030, it wants 27 per cent to 30 per cent of its electricity to come from renewable sources. It's also about protecting Taiwan's export-driven economy, as key markets start to impose carbon import taxes.

If I am the leader of a country, I will think about the survival of this economy. If we don't follow the net-zero policy or carbon neutrality, there will be a lot of impact on domestic industries. Taiwan is an export oriented economy. We rely on exports to make our living. And so we have to follow the international protocol, the carbon adjustment mechanism by the European Union just announced. And that's a very big impact to the society here.

By the end of 2023, Taiwan had installed just over 2 gigawatts of offshore wind power. It's the leading offshore wind market in Asia-Pacific outside of China, driven by interest from developers around the world. They include Jera, the Japanese energy company which along with partners is behind two of the first wind farms in Taiwan.

If you look at the natural resources in Taiwan, the wind, which everybody can see it's up to more than 11 metres per second here in the Taiwan Strait. So from a wind perspective Taiwan is a very interesting place to be. But also I think the Taiwanese government has set a very good regulatory framework to build out a vast and significant number of megawatts in offshore wind here in the next years to come.

The government has set a target of having up to 13 gigawatts of offshore wind installed by the end of the decade, and up to 55 gigawatts by the end of 2050. But requirements for many turbine parts to be domestically made have raised questions in Taiwan and around the world. Governments want the new energy industry to lead to new domestic jobs. But developers warn requirements can push up costs if the supply chain isn't ready.

Wind giant Orsted, a major player in Taiwan, decided not to bid for new projects in a recent auction round.

I think Orsted was pretty vocal when we saw the framework for that particular round, round 3.1. We could see that there were some challenges that we did not experience in the first two rounds. We called it the trilemma at that time. It was the combination of the local content rules and also the pricing mechanism. And then it was the size of the projects. So all of these have to be in place in order to make a viable business case.

Siemens Gamesa, the European wind turbine maker, is expanding its nacelle factory in the port of Taichung, western Taiwan. But it also warns that local content requirements can be challenging.

From a localisation standpoint, the advantage of building a nacelle factory is obviously that we assemble more than 8,000 components inside that factory, and put them together into the nacelle. And that is in principle 8,000 localisation opportunities. However, that only works if there is a path towards ideally reduced cost because you don't have to ship them from anywhere. You can buy them locally.

If the result of those 8,000 components being localised is an increase in cost, then we are back to the question of do we have an off-take that supports that cost level.

All eyes are now on a new auction round for offshore wind projects. Orsted, which has several other projects in Taiwan, says the government has been listening.

We are happy to see that with a good dialogue we have with the government we have seen improvements. And in the upcoming round I will say we are very hopeful with what we have seen that we will be able to do it. But we cannot say it for sure yet.

Jera will not be among those bidding, having sold its stake in its Formosa 3 project in 2023.

We are not looking to develop a new wind farm in the next round here in Taiwan. It was very important for us to diversify our portfolio from a regional perspective. So we did some acquisitions in Europe. So we have five wind farms in Europe, one under development in Japan, and then Formosa 1 and Formosa 2 here in Taiwan.

Even if Taiwan gets the balance right the country's experience holds lessons for other markets, Siemens Gamesa argues.

So Taiwan got a lot of benefits in terms of localisation, simply because they were first. But we cannot as an industry repeat this in every country in the world that wants to buy an offshore wind turbine.

You can't go through the difficult starting phase, and then the cost curve, and you can't do that everywhere?

And we will not have enough volume. We will end up with small, small factories that produce very few turbines at a very, very high cost in every country. Why is offshore wind so successful in Europe? The key to that is competition. It is volume and competition that has brought the cost of offshore wind down.

As Taiwan's offshore wind industry progresses industrial users of energy are starting to play a greater role. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company signed a deal in 2020 to buy electricity from two major wind farms Orsted is now developing. These long-term deals can help get offshore wind projects off the ground. It also allows TSMC's customers like Apple to say they're using green energy.

Taiwan was known for the global semiconductor in the electronic, microelectronic supply chain. According to my observation, from the global big brands, for example, Apple, Amazon, or Facebook, Google, the other big brands. Of course, they will first commit themselves like how they want to achieve. And also they have their timeline in the roadmap. So based on the timeline and the roadmap, they will invite their supply chain to participate.

How you can help me to, collective effort, to achieve the goal?

It is hoped such deals will become more common in Taiwan and around the world. However, they are complicated to strike and manage, putting smaller companies at a potential disadvantage.

People or the company or manufacturing facility are quite familiar with receiving utility bills and pay the bill afterwards. So when you started to consider like corporate PPAs, and you need to start coming back to your production team, like what is our demand profile throughout the day, the month, and the year, and to understanding what kind of renewable sources we can use from solar PV, offshore wind. And that required a bit of technical assessment which maybe all these manufacturing facilities doesn't really have these in-house in the past.

Sure, yeah.

That's one thing. And then second is used to be paying the utility bill from the finance department. Now the procurement department has to step in creating contracts, negotiating with international developers or utilities. Those require some new skills from local companies. So these are starting a bit of a challenging and complicated task for companies to study negotiating with the developer.

How you actually put together bankable corporate PPAs, that is also a challenge for both the developers and off-takers.

In Taiwan, the government is stepping in to help, potentially providing a model for others around the world.

The other companies, they want to buy. But the lender, they are worried about the other company's credit. Because they think even if you signed a contract with the other buyer, the lender don't have much confidence about the buyer, because they think maybe their financial system is not so good, maybe the company will unstable. So right now we develop a new system or new mechanism to deal with these issues. That is the credit guarantee system.

The government will set a fund to guarantee the buyer. So if the lender, they worry about the buyer's credit, they can get the guarantee from the guarantee government guarantee fund to support the buyer. And we will use this mechanism to deal with these credit issues.

Critics are not convinced it is enough, however.

I think that's a great start. But the problem is, it's not fast enough and the rules are actually being drafted and released as we speak. If you're a business owner and you've got immediate pressures for export and a strong need for green energy, this is just not good enough.

In the 2021 Chamber of Commerce white paper, the top concern is around the lack of assistance for business to purchase green energy. This dissatisfaction rate is as high as 62 per cent. Whether it's working with communities, local fisheries for offshore wind, or it's discussing with the population, educating them on the pros and cons of restarting our nuclear power plants, there could be a lot more that could be done to facilitate dialogue and understanding around this area.

Taiwan is trying to get its industry off the ground against a fraught geopolitical backdrop. Across the Taiwan Strait sits China, which refuses to renounce the threat of force to bring Taiwan under its control. For now, developers are making reassuring noises about how this affects their appetite.

I think it is on everybody's minds and I think in every boardroom questions are asked about this subject. I do think that there is still a stable climate here. And we are still here as a long-term investor.

Based on our evaluation and following it closely, obviously also being here in the Taiwan Strait, we feel confident that we will be able to continue to work successfully in this region, and not least also in Taiwan in the coming years.

I think we have some geopolitical advantages and disadvantages when it comes to offshore wind. Geopolitically speaking, dangerous because of China, advantageous because we have very nice wind conditions. What I'm also hearing from foreign players based locally is that it's actually the war of Ukraine that is shifting a lot of the projects back to Europe right now.

Despite the complications, Taiwan prefers to stick to its ambitious goals.

The target of net zero is ambitious. But we need ambitious. We need the target to be ambitious. If we put a target very low, so we cannot achieve anything or we can achieve even lower. And so we have to set up our standard high and go for it even though we cannot achieve that in the target years.

Taiwan's goals are indeed high, and it comes as countries around the world are increasingly competing for offshore wind investment. Meanwhile, developers are under pressure from rising costs. With such a challenging path ahead, there is little room for setbacks.","Taiwan wants to be a frontrunner in offshore wind power, making the most of its high wind speeds. Taiwan currently relies on oil, coal, and gas for its energy, almost all of which is imported. By 2030, Taiwan wants 27 per cent of its electricity to come from renewable sources.","[('taiwan', 0.4528), ('renewable', 0.3589), ('electricity', 0.271), ('wind', 0.2667), ('energy', 0.2559), ('coal', 0.2532), ('power', 0.2467), ('offshore', 0.1973), ('oil', 0.1699), ('gas', 0.1672)]","taiwan, renewable, electricity, wind, energy, coal, power, offshore, oil, gas",73

2024-01-31,Chef Albert Adrià's guide to Barcelona,"Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

Until I was 15, Barcelona was my home. Then I went to work with my brother Ferran at El Bulli up the coast and didn't come back to the city until I was 29. One of the special things about Barcelona is that it's bounded by rivers to the north and south, there are mountains to the west and sea to the east, so it can't really grow. To anyone that comes here I just recommend they walk - walk all over the place. I don't use a car. I walk all the time. You can really see the different aesthetics of neighbourhoods.

We have amazing architecture, and a crazy number of music festivals, such as Cruïlla, Primavera, Sónar and Festival de Jazz de Barcelona. So many world‑famous artists come throughout the year, and our museums are always packed with tourists. I'm a pizza lover, and in recent years Barcelona has become a world capital for pizzerias. The award for the best pizza restaurant in Europe was given to Sartoria Panatieri last year. Other favourites are Parking Pizza, La Balmesina and Frankie Gallo Cha Cha Cha.

Downtown, I recommend Bismillah Kebabish. It's very casual and in one of the most beautiful streets, Joaquín Costa. They make the softest shawarma bread while you wait. Near here is Granja Viader, which is famous for chocolate and churros and Cacaolat, a Catalan chocolate milk. It's packed at breakfast time. Nearby you'll find Xarcutería La Pineda, where they have four different hams available at the same time. Normally in a store you'll just find one.

Another place that's very special to me is Dos Palillos, the restaurant of a chef from El Bulli; his wife is Japanese and the food is a beautiful combination of Spanish and Japanese. For Mexican, go to Michelin-starred Come and order suckling-pig tacos. I don't often go out to eat pasta in Barcelona - I make it at home - but there are some very good Italian restaurants, including the Venetian Bacaro and Xemei, where I think the Rolling Stones went when they last visited.

My little secret is Bodega del Vermut. I go there and have my vermouth ritual, which is not just a drink but the very Barcelonian tradition of eating cured anchovies, stuffed olives, potato crisps, canned mussels and, on special occasions, an expensive can of clams. They de-salt and clean the anchovies daily, and it's very difficult to find them with this quality. The interior is one of the most beautiful and authentic corners in Barcelona. Historically there hasn't been much of a culture of going to cocktail bars here. But this is changing; in 2022 Paradiso was voted the number one in the world, followed last year by Sips. It's almost impossible to get in.

If you want to shop for big brands, there's the Passeig de Gràcia. But personally I prefer El Born, a smaller, older neighbourhood that has a New York SoHo vibe, with alternative brands and little shops. The Gothic Quarter is a beautiful neighbourhood to walk around, and there's Bar Brutal for natural and local wines and Ganivetería Roca for beautiful kitchen knives and wares.

Head to Carrer de l'Argenteria for provisions: Sans & Sans sells teas, and Casa Gispert, a beautiful shop from 1851, roasts all sorts of nuts over wood. There's also Vila Viniteca, which is the most important wine shop in the city. Barcelona's most famous market is the Boqueria but the quality has been going downhill in recent years. It's so full of tourists that it's lost the sense of a market. Head instead to the less touristy Mercat de Santa Caterina and Mercat de Sant Antoni, around the corner from my restaurant Enigma.

For hotels, I recommend La Florida in the mountains or the Miramar on a hill overlooking the sea. Both have great views. In the centre of town there's Alma and El Palace, in which Amar, a great seafood restaurant, opened in 2022. When Barack Obama, Bruce Springsteen and Steven Spielberg were last in Barcelona they went there. The next day it was the most famous restaurant in the city.","Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Until she was 15, Barcelona was my home.

2024-01-31,"AfD 'Dexit' move would destroy Germany's wealth, says chancellor","Simply sign up to the German politics myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.

German chancellor Olaf Scholz slammed the far-right Alternative for Germany's plans for ""Dexit"", saying any move to leave the EU would be catastrophic for the bloc's largest economy.

""That would be the biggest destroyer of wealth that could ever happen to Europe and Germany,"" he told the Bundestag. ""Our country has profited more than any other from the EU and [European] co-operation.""

In a combative speech in the German parliament on Wednesday, Scholz said Britain's exit from the EU four years ago had ""plunged the UK into economic disaster"".

His comments, during a debate on the 2024 budget, came just over a week after AfD party leader Alice Weidel told the Financial Times that Brexit was a ""model"" for Germany.

Weidel said an AfD government would seek to reform the EU and remove its ""democratic deficit"". If that didn't work, she said, then ""we should let the people decide, just as Britain did"". ""And we could have a referendum on 'Dexit' -- a German exit from the EU.""

Scholz's view is widely shared by German business leaders. ""When I speak to my colleagues in the UK, they say they were never in favour of Brexit and are still against it,"" said Siegfried Russwurm, head of the BDI, Germany's main business lobby.

In an interview with the Financial Times, Russwurm said Germany had ""been one of the biggest beneficiaries"" of the European single market and the single currency.

He warned against the AfD's Dexit plans. ""As an exporting nation, Germany profits from its openness to the world more than almost any other country,"" he said. ""We must have open borders.""

Scholz told MPs that Germany's history meant it had an obligation to become a bulwark against far-right forces such as the AfD.

""With rightwing populism gaining so much support in the US, with Brexit plunging the UK into economic disaster, with so many governments in Europe being backed by rightwing populists -- and sometimes they're even in the government -- then we in Germany have a role, arising from our history, to stop this trend, and to do it together,"" he said.

Scholz was speaking amid mounting concern among mainstream parties about the strengthening of the AfD, which is currently polling at about 20 per cent -- ahead of all three parties in Scholz's coalition.

The party has profited from rising dissatisfaction with the government, an alliance of Social Democrats, Greens and liberals. That found its most visible expression in recent protests by farmers over a cut to agricultural subsidies, which saw hundreds of tractors converging on Berlin's Brandenburg Gate.

But some recent polls suggest the AfD may be suffering a backlash after reports earlier this month that some of the party's functionaries had met far-right radicals to discuss plans for the mass deportation of people with immigrant roots -- including those with German citizenship.

The reports triggered mass demonstrations across Germany against the rise of the AfD and the extreme right. The party finished second in a district election that it was expected to win in the eastern state of Thuringia at the weekend.","German chancellor Olaf Scholz slams the Alternative for Germany's plans for ""Dexit"" he says any move to leave the EU would be catastrophic for the bloc's largest economy.

2024-01-31,Stock markets are in a sweet spot,"Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

The writer is global head of investment strategy for JPMorgan Private Bank

After a powerful fourth quarter rally, equity investors were a bit skittish at the start of 2024. But they have since driven the US S&P 500 index to new highs. More gains lie ahead.

Stock markets are in a very sweet spot and we expect they will make more new highs in 2024. This can be chalked up to moderating but continued economic growth, cooling inflation and upcoming central bank cuts to interest rates. But we also point to these key reasons:

The positive earnings outlook. With US earnings season under way, companies look well-positioned to increase their profits in a slowing (though still resilient) growth environment in 2024.

US large cap corporates have already gone through an earnings recession. Nine of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 reported negative earnings growth for three consecutive quarters in 2022-2023.

Companies have emerged with leaner cost structures and stronger balance sheets. When rates were low, companies sensibly extended the maturities on their debt. And today 70 per cent of the debt of S&P 500 companies is at fixed rates, compared with less than 50 per cent in 2007.

More gains tend to come after markets hit new all-time highs. Investing at all-time highs has traditionally signalled further gains ahead. Here's what we find when we examine data back to 1970: on average, one year after investing at a new record, the S&P 500 was up more than 70 per cent of the time, with a median return of 12.1 per cent. That return is higher than the overall median of 10.5 per cent returns over one year from investing at any one point. Indeed, the S&P 500 rarely makes a new high and then fails to make another.

Strong gains can come even the year after strong rallies. Last year, the S&P 500 delivered a 26 per cent total return. We looked at what happens after calendar years with rallies of 20 per cent or more. Out of the 14 other instances since 1970, 11 of them (nearly 80 per cent) ended the next year higher. What's more, the median return the following year was 13.7 per cent. Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future results. But if we map that trend on to 2023's year-end close of 4,769, it puts the S&P 500 north of 5,400 in December.

Federal Reserve cutting cycles that coincide with soft landings are usually a good time to get invested. Going back to 1970, the S&P 500 typically rallies by roughly 16 per cent on average in the 12 months after the first Fed rate cut when a recession is avoided over that period. What's more, five of the 10 best years of the past 40 for the S&P 500 have occurred when the Fed was cutting rates without a recession: 1985 (32 per cent), 1989 (32 per cent), 1995 (38 per cent), 1998 (29 per cent), 2019 (31 per cent).

Admittedly, stocks are not cheap. US equity valuations trade at the high end of the range for the market cap-weighted S&P 500 over the last 20 years and closer to the median for the equivalent index where constituents are all equal weighted rather than weighted to their relative size.

At first glance, the Magnificent Seven -- the megacap tech stocks that accounted for more than 60 per cent of the S&P 500 return last year -- seem quite expensive relative to the broader market. But Magnificent Seven valuations seem less excessive considering their distinctive strengths: strong free cash flow growth (14.5 per cent compound annual growth rate versus 7 per cent for the rest of the index since 2018), superior profit margins (19 per cent versus 9 per cent for the rest of the index) and higher earnings growth expectations.

In our equity portfolios, we like a blend of quality growth (technology), quality cyclicals (industrials) and quality defensives (healthcare). On a regional basis, the US is our preferred market. Anticipating a soft landing for the US economy, we estimate 8 per cent S&P 500 profit growth in 2024 and 2025.

We acknowledge two main risks to our outlook. If inflation were to accelerate (if, say, escalating geopolitical conflict leads to a commodity price shock or wage growth proves sticky), the Fed could be forced to postpone rate cuts or even raise rates. In such a scenario, both stocks and bonds would struggle.

Alternatively, economic growth data could disappoint. That might reflect geopolitical tensions or the lagged effects of higher rates and tighter financial conditions on corporate profits.

But neither scenario is our base case. So to those who look at last year's market rally and the new January high and conclude they missed their moment, we say -- don't worry. Historical data and current fundamentals tell us that equity markets can hit new highs over the coming year.","Investors were a bit skittish at the start of 2024, but they have since driven the US S&P 500 to new highs.

2024-01-31,Chinese investors buy gold as property and stock markets fall,"Simply sign up to the Chinese economy myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.

Chinese investors and households have been buying gold as a refuge from local property and stock market mayhem, helping to support record prices for the haven asset.

China was the principal bright spot globally for gold jewellery and investment flows in 2023, according to industry group the World Gold Council's quarterly report, as local property, equity and currency markets disappointed following the country's exit from Covid-19 lockdowns.

Together with ""blistering"" demand from central banks, according to the WGC, Chinese demand helped push the gold price to record highs last month and keep it above $2,000 per troy ounce this year.

Chinese investment demand for gold -- spanning bars, coins and exchange traded funds -- grew 28 per cent to 280 tonnes, largely offsetting a steep drop in Europe. The country's jewellery consumption rose 10 per cent to 630 tonnes last year, even as global demand remained flat.

""China was key to a lot of what was happening last year,"" said Louise Street, senior markets analyst at WGC. ""When you look at the consumer sector, China is not the price-setting factor but it is providing a floor.""

The country's CSI 300 equity index has fallen by more than a fifth in the last year, while the value of new home sales among the country's biggest developers in December was down 35 per cent from a year earlier.

Chinese investors face an ""ugliness contest"" over where to put the huge level of savings they have accumulated during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to BMO analyst Colin Hamilton. ""Gold exposure has become a necessity for Chinese portfolios as they continue to expect disinflation and income uncertainty,"" he said.

Analysts at UBS said that Chinese demand has been ""under-appreciated"" as a factor driving gold prices.

Overall, gold demand slipped 5 per cent to 4,448 tonnes last year, cooling off from a strong 2022, according to the WGC report. However, after incorporating over-the-counter and stock flows -- which capture an opaque source of buying by wealthy individuals, sovereign wealth funds and futures market speculators, as well as changes in exchanges' inventories -- annual demand was at its highest on record at 4,899 tonnes.

The record demand levels and soaring prices for gold have come despite interest rate rises last year, which increased the attractiveness of bonds relative to the non-yielding asset. That helped push investment demand for gold to a 10-year low of 945 tonnes.

But offsetting that weakness in investment demand was central bank buying led by China, Poland and Singapore, which helped keep net purchases above 1,000 tonnes.

However, more than half of the central bank buying was attributed to mystery buyers, as official financial institutions conceal the true volume of purchases from the IMF or use other sovereign vehicles to acquire the gold.

BMO's Hamilton said gold was in a ""new era"", having broken its correlation with real rates and instead being driven by central banks and Chinese household asset allocation.

""Surging demand in gold's number one consumer nation shows no sign of letting up,"" said Adrian Ash, director of research at BullionVault, an online precious metals investment service.","Chinese investors and households have been buying gold as a refuge from local property and stock market mayhem.

2024-01-31,Transcript: Is this nuclear power's moment?,"Michela Tindera

In March 2011, the largest earthquake ever recorded in Japan shocked the country's northeastern region. Massive tsunami waves followed. Those waves flooded the reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant and led to a leak of radioactive materials. It was the world's worst nuclear disaster in a quarter of a century. And afterward, it's no surprise the demand for nuclear power collapsed.

Jamie Smyth

After Fukushima, there was just this huge downward turn across the whole sector. There wasn't enough demand, so it really dented the industry.

Michela Tindera

That's FT's US energy editor Jamie Smyth.

Jamie Smyth

Japan immediately shut down its reactor fleet. Germany shut down some reactors and pledged to leave the industry entirely. Other nuclear plants were put on ice. And, of course, because a lot of the US companies were privately owned, depending on investment, it left them weakened and vulnerable.

Michela Tindera

After facing major controversies and tragedies around the world, from Three Mile Island to Chernobyl to Fukushima, the nuclear power industry is one that's become known for its boom-and-bust cycles that have left anyone wanting to invest in nuclear power feeling quite skittish. But lately, nuclear power has been experiencing yet another revival, in part due to climate change.

Jamie Smyth

One of the big benefits with nuclear power is it doesn't generate the type of greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide, that you get from burning oil and gas. So this means climate advocates in particular have really begun to sort of push ahead with this idea that nuclear can be part of the solution to climate change. Also, while there's a lot of excitement for other renewable sources of energy, they're not quite as reliable as nuclear. So if you think about solar or wind, if there's no sun or wind, they end up not being as dependable as a source of electricity. Nuclear really provides a stable, steady source of energy that is not interrupted by weather events.

Michela Tindera

Jamie tells me that a new crop of start-ups in the US have been trying to seize on this moment. Thanks to recent technological and scientific advancements, a group of companies has been developing what advocates say are safer and cheaper ways to generate nuclear power.

Jamie Smyth

One of the really interesting things about the nuclear industry at the minute is that you literally have dozens of start-ups getting funding from venture capital groups, getting funding from rich tech gurus and the like. This is many more than we've traditionally seen in the past.

Michela Tindera

Established companies like Rolls-Royce, General Electric and Hitachi have poured money into the space. And even tech founders like Microsoft's Bill Gates and OpenAI's Sam Altman are involved. Here's Altman touting nuclear's benefits in a video published last year.

Sam Altman voice clip

Energy is so important in so many things that we all do every day, and if we can bring the amount of cheap, clean, safe energy that the world has access to to new heights, that'll be a wonderful thing.

Michela Tindera

Some advocates of nuclear energy are calling this the dawn of a new nuclear renaissance. But at the same time, these companies are facing big challenges both domestic and abroad. And these challenges are threatening to yet again spoil nuclear power's big moment.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

I'm Michela Tindera from the Financial Times. Today on Behind the Money: is the US on the precipice of a nuclear power renaissance? Or will it stall out before it even gets started?

Michela Tindera

Can you give me the lay of the land of nuclear power in the US as it exists right now?

Jamie Smyth

Well, I think it's important to say that the US does have the largest nuclear power supply in the world. There are 93 reactors, and 20 per cent of US electric energy comes from nuclear power. But many of these reactors were built decades ago. There's been a big slowdown in production of new facilities recently.

Michela Tindera

And why is that?

Jamie Smyth

Well, there are big hindrances to this industry, basically because they're huge, complex megaprojects, these nuclear power plants. So they cost a lot of money. There's a lot of specialised equipment that goes into them, and that makes it difficult for investors, you know, who have to raise the capital upfront to pay for a facility which will take years before it actually starts generating cash.

Michela Tindera

In the US, like in many other countries, the nuclear industry, while it's been subsidised by the government at times, it's a private industry. So of course, market forces are at play. Now, Jamie, after the Fukushima disaster in 2011, demand for nuclear power just disintegrated. But more recently, we've seen this upswing in interest, and that's in part due to climate change. But there's also been these new technological advancements. So can you tell me more about them? Right now, I have to say the image in my head of what a nuclear power plant looks like is pretty much where Homer works on The Simpsons.

Jamie Smyth

So one of the main types of new technology that people think could really change the game for nuclear energy is what's called SMRs -- small modular reactors. So, like they sound, they are a lot smaller than your standard nuclear reactor. They're typically around a third of the size. Also, the smaller nature of these SMRs means that the components that go into them and the materials that you're using to build them can often be made in factories. So rather than the custom-made style components that go into the larger nuclear power plants, these can be made much more cheaply and efficiently. And they can be moved then to the site where you're gonna assemble your SMR.

Michela Tindera

Oh, interesting. Now this is where start-ups like Sam Altman's come in. Since 2015, Altman has been the chairman of a company that's developing this SMR technology. It's called Oklo. And last year, Oklo announced that it was gonna go public via special purpose acquisition company, or Spac, to raise more money to put towards developing this technology.

Jamie Smyth

The merger was proposed at a valuation of $850mn, and it would provide Oklo with about $500mn to develop and commercialise its reactor design. So it says its designs are gonna be much more highly efficient and safer than standard reactors. And, it is confident that its Spac deal is gonna go live in the first quarter of 2024.

Michela Tindera

So they haven't built any SMRs yet. And I should note that generally speaking, this technology is still quite unproven. The only SMRs that have been built and are operating today are in Russia and China, and they only opened quite recently. But as it turns out, even though things sound promising in a lot of ways, developing a new type of nuclear power plant isn't so simple.

Jamie Smyth

So some of these new nuclear start-ups have really hit the skids over the past 12 to 18 months.

Michela Tindera

So, Jamie, you said that some of these start-ups we were talking about have faced some issues more recently too. Why is that?

Jamie Smyth

We've seen these inflationary pressures, higher interest rates really hit home on more speculative investments, you know, more risky investments. And the nuclear sector has fallen victim to that. You've also seen some delays to big projects. And that has also dented investors' confidence in the industry.

Michela Tindera

So like many of the slowdowns we've talked about recently on the show, it often goes back to interest rates. Jamie says that in this particular sector of start-ups, this has led to a few situations where major contracts have been cancelled and plans to go public have fallen through. But, you know, nuclear power is, to put it lightly, much more complicated than developing, say, a new social media app or ecommerce company. And there are much more complex problems at hand that go beyond the current interest rate environment. So what are some of the other challenges for these companies?

Jamie Smyth

One of the big issues facing the new generation of nuclear start-ups in the US is that SMRs rely on something called Haleu. This is a very powerful type of nuclear fuel. The uranium is enriched to a much higher level than the fuel used for standard nuclear reactors. And crucially, there's only one supplier of this fuel in the whole world, and that is Tenex, a state-owned company in Russia.

Michela Tindera

And it goes beyond the SMRs too. Jamie tells me that more than a fifth of the fuel used by the US's existing nuclear reactors is supplied through contracts with Russian suppliers. And since Russia invaded Ukraine, this part of the country's supply chain has become a national security issue.

Jamie Smyth

So one of the interesting things about the energy sector is that when we had Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the US immediately slapped sanctions on the oil and gas sector, but it didn't touch the nuclear sector. And that's because the US utilities and power companies are really reliant on Russian nuclear fuel. And so the Biden administration felt it couldn't actually slap sanctions on Russian nuclear fuel at the time.

Michela Tindera

So this is a really tricky situation. How is the US planning to handle this? I mean, thinking about both the country's existing fleet of reactors and then also these new SMRs that are in development.

Jamie Smyth

The US is doing a few things. First of all, it's investing billions of dollars to help rebuild its own nuclear fuel supply chain, which fell apart after Fukushima. That means building up the section of the supply chain that's in between mining the uranium ore and using the fuel in the plant. So it's got grant programs out at the minute. It's offering money to these SMR developers and also in the Inflation Reduction Act, offering incentives for nuclear energy companies. It's also teaming up with other western nations as part of what people are calling a friendshoring strategy on nuclear fuel. The US, the UK, France, Canada and Japan agreed last year to invest almost $5bn to add new capacity to enrich uranium.

Michela Tindera

OK. Got it. So what's the other part of this then?

Jamie Smyth

So the Biden administration believes that there's no point in spending billions of dollars of taxpayers money building up its own industry if it doesn't tackle the dominance of Russia's nuclear fuel sector. Russia can provide this fuel cheaper than the US private companies. So the Biden administration is proposing to place a ban and pass legislation to actually stop imports of Russian fuel.

Michela Tindera

What's the status of that right now?

Jamie Smyth

We've already had one bill passed the House of Representatives. That would lead to a ban on imports of Russian nuclear fuel. But it would give a couple of years of waivers and leeway so that utilities that still need some Russian fuel could apply to get it. And in the Senate there's currently legislation being prepared, which most experts think it'll probably get voted on this year unless the presidential election intervenes. And that would lead to a ban as soon as the president sign that order.

Michela Tindera

Is it likely that these plans would continue if Joe Biden is no longer the president?

Jamie Smyth

Experts say they think the bill will pass the Senate this year, because one of the key things about the nuclear sector is it actually retains bipartisan support in Congress. Republicans support boosting nuclear energy as well as the Democrats. So it's one of those few areas in America where we seem to have some political agreement that nuclear is a good thing and a path forward. Now, if the bill doesn't pass before the election and Donald Trump wins the presidency, then of course all bets are off. We're not really sure what way it will go.

Michela Tindera

So what would you say needs to be done to move this SMR sector forward? You know, at this point.

Jamie Smyth

I suppose, you know, when money was cheap, investors were very keen to invest in the nuclear sector. But when money is difficult to come by, when it's more expensive and they look at the risk of nuclear technologies, then it becomes a much tougher sell. To sustain a viable industry, you've got to generate a lot of money. And the nuclear industry hasn't proved to be very profitable in the past. We've seen all these cost blowouts, we've seen all these delays. So for SMRs to take off, you've got to see some deployment and then deployment at scale. They only become profitable if you could actually build, you know, more than five or six of these. You want them to be like a factory production line. That's the sort of business model that will make SMRs work.

Michela Tindera

So this all really comes down to what the government does then, right?

Jamie Smyth

It's gonna depend a lot on, I think, the commitment of governments to really provide funding over the long term and retain political support for nuclear going forward for this strategy to survive. I think one of the key elements for the Biden administration is it sees its rivals, Russia and China, powering ahead. They have already deployed SMR reactors. It's very unusual for America to fall behind in a technological race like this. So that is really providing the incentive to push ahead and give money and try and build up the sector.

2024-01-31,Transcript: Palestinians pay the price for UN allegations,"Marc Filippino

Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Wednesday, January 31st. And this is your FT News Briefing.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Microsoft had a stellar fourth quarter, and the global economy is doing better than expected. Plus, allegations against a UN agency called UNRWA is putting more pressure on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

Mehul Srivastava

Within Gaza itself, what UNRWA is doing is described to me by almost everybody as indispensable. For many people in Gaza, UNRWA food, UNRWA vaccinations and their medicine is pretty much the only way that they've managed to survive.

Marc Filippino

I'm Marc Filipino, and here's the news you need to start your day.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Microsoft reported record quarterly revenues yesterday. That's thanks to strong demand for its cloud computing services and excitement about the company's investment in artificial intelligence. But investors couldn't get excited about the report itself. Shares fell more than 1 per cent in after-hours trading yesterday. Meanwhile, Google's parent company, Alphabet, had more of a meh-day when it reported earnings. Its ad revenue came in just shy of Wall Street's expectations. And just shy is a big deal when the division makes up roughly 80 per cent of Alphabet's top line. The miss sent the company's shares down by as much as 5 per cent in after-hours trading. But it wasn't all bad for Alphabet. The company closed out 2023 with stronger-than-expected growth, thanks in large part to its Google Cloud services business.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

The International Monetary Fund came out with its global economic outlook yesterday, and there were a few surprises. For one, Russia's economy is now expected to grow much faster than the IMF previously thought it would. And the global economy is also expected to do much better. Here to explain is the FT's acting US economics editor Claire Jones. Hi, Claire.

Claire Jones

Hi there, Marc.

Marc Filippino

So let's start with Russia. What is the IMF predicting for its economy this year?

Claire Jones

So its forecast for Russian growth in 2024 has been upgraded in a massive way. It's now expecting the Russian economy to grow by 2.6 per cent in 2024. That's more than double the level it was expecting back in October. However, there's another facet of this. Ukraine's allies have imposed a lot of sanctions on Russia. Now, there will be question marks with these forecasts about the degree to which those sanctions, which were supposed to damage the Russian economy are actually having the desired impact.

Marc Filippino

Well, that's an enormous jump, considering all those sanctions that were supposed to damage Russia's economy. Why is the country doing so well?

Claire Jones

One reason why you're seeing quite quick growth in Russia is because it's a war economy. That means, you know, manufacturing is having to, you know, have a lot of investment made into it by government spending to meet what the defence requirements are so that boost the economy. I would note that we do need to be a little bit cautious with the Russian growth estimates because they're based on Russian statistical data, the accuracy of which is not the best. So it may be the case that things don't turn out quite as well as these forecasts tend to suggest.

Marc Filippino

OK so a little bit of an asterisk there, we're talking about the Russian economy and its potential growth. The global economy though is also expected to grow at a faster rate. What do you make of that?

Claire Jones

Well, I think let's take a step back. This time last year, there was a lot of doom and gloom about inflation was still very high, and the expectation was to get inflation down. We were going to have to see recessions in the US, a big recession in the euro area and quite a steep rise in unemployment rates. You know, the global economy has just done a lot better than expected in 2023. And it's really been led by the US. We found out last week that the US economy grew by 3.1 per cent over the course of 2023. That's massively better than people expected.

Marc Filippino

Yeah, and I think the reason people were expecting a recession is because central banks around the world were raising interest rates to try and combat inflation. Why aren't interest rates slowing down the global economy as much as the IMF and others thought they would?

Claire Jones

I think it's the sort of question that people are still be trying to ask 10 years from now. Clearly, we've had a very unique shock in the shape of the global pandemic. Inflation's come down. That could be due in part to higher interest rates. But we've also had a lot of supply-side effects. So we've seen cheaper energy and commodity prices. And we've also seen a lot more immigration which has helped kind of soothe tensions in the labour market.

Marc Filippino

All right. Given all the potential strength that we're talking about in this IMF outlook, does that mean we might have to wait even longer for central banks to cut interest rates?

Claire Jones

The fact that economies look reasonably strong means that they can afford to take their time. I think interest rate cuts will almost certainly happen over the course of this year in both the US and Europe.

Marc Filippino

Claire Jones is the FT's acting US economics editor. Thanks, Claire.

Claire Jones

Pleasure.

Marc Filippino

Violence in the Red Sea has pushed diesel prices up to a nearly three-month high. Houthi rebels have been attacking ships over the past several months, and the latest caused fuel tanker rates and diesel prices to jump. For context, freight rates are already at levels not seen since the pandemic, but one source said that they've doubled over the past week for the largest tankers. The ongoing attacks mean that even more ships might get rerouted around the Cape of Good Hope, which would in turn continue pushing up prices.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

The UN's long-standing agency for Palestinian refugees called UNRWA is in crisis. Staff members in Gaza are accused of being involved in the October 7th attacks on Israel. The UN has since fired these employees and started an investigation. But the seriousness of the allegations have led major donors to pull funding from the organisation, and the UN is warning that operations at the aid agency could end in a matter of weeks. I'm joined now by Mehul Srivastava. He's covering the Israel-Hamas war for the FT. Hi, Mehul.

Mehul Srivastava

Hi. How are you?

Marc Filippino

I'm doing all right. Mehul, walk us through some of the allegations.

Mehul Srivastava

So the allegations have not been made publicly. There's a dossier that Israeli intelligence created from signal intercepts and other such things within which they claim that they have identified 12 people within Gaza who were employees at UNRWA, who were involved in the October 7th cross-border raid, where about 12 other people inside Israel were killed and 240 people were dragged back as hostages. These are Israeli allegations for which we have not seen any evidence. But on the other hand, the international community has taken these incredibly serious allegations incredibly seriously. The United States, which is the primary funder for UNRWA, said it would pause disbursement of any more aid in the future while this investigation continues. Fourteen other countries have followed. So you now have about a $443mn hole in UNRWA's $1.2bn budget.

Marc Filippino

Now, before we get into what this means on the ground, Mehul, can you tell me a little bit more about UNRWA and its roots?

Mehul Srivastava

I mean, it's a long history. It's been around for about 75 years now. It was set up in 1949 by the United Nations because it had become clear that the outcome of the 1948 war had resulted in the displacement of about 750,000 Palestinians. These people, who needed aid as refugees but also had a special status as Palestinian refugees. So this agency cares only for Palestinian refugees, and over time, as refugee problem has grown because people have children, the number of people that it cares for has gone up to about 5mn or so. (Inaudible) schools, hospitals, runs vaccinations, you know, training programmes, etc. But essentially, the idea is this agency exists to take care of the refugees until the refugee problem has a political solution.

Marc Filippino

What has Israel's relationship or view of UNRWA been?

Mehul Srivastava

Israel had a very combative relationship with UNRWA, especially in the last 20 years, as its governments have grown more rightwing. At the core of its objections to UNRWA is the fact that it entrenches the Palestinian refugees and increases the numbers by allowing the descendants of refugees to be registered. But the other objection they have, to be more specific, is the idea that some of UNRWA schools have used textbooks that valorise armed resistance to Israel's occupation. They have in the past made quite serious allegations about UNRWA facilities being used during combat by Hamas terrorists.

Marc Filippino

Mehul, with that in mind, just how vital has UNRWA been during this current war between Israel and Hamas?

Mehul Srivastava

Within Gaza itself, what UNRWA is doing is described to me by almost everybody as indispensable. A lot of its schools have become shelters, with tens of thousands of people sheltering in as many of them they can. And for many people in Gaza, of whom about 1.8mn have been displaced from their homes, UNRWA food, UNRWA vaccinations and their medicine is pretty much the only way that they've managed to survive.

Marc Filippino

Yeah. So if Israel's accusations proved to be correct, and they eventually lead to UNRWA shutting down completely, what would happen to refugees in Gaza?

Mehul Srivastava

You know, it's a very complicated answer because nobody's expecting that UNRWA would collapse but were it to stop operations for even one week in Gaza, the UN has already warned that Gaza is on the verge of famine. You know, we spoke to two people in Gaza. One of them said that all they have to live on is food coupons from UNRWA. And the other person talked about the blankets and the food and the sugar and the milk and flour that they received. It's not clear how they would get any basic needs, like food or water for the children or for themselves. So I think there are countries that are waiting for the investigation to be completed. But the damage to UNRWA's finances and in many ways to its image have already been done.

The nuclear power industry is receiving a lot of attention recently thanks in part to new technological advancements. That's excited venture capital groups and private investors, such as Bill Gates and OpenAI's Sam Altman. But the industry is also known for its boom-and-bust cycles. The FT's US energy editor Jamie Smyth explains there are many challenges that lie ahead for an industry, which has long been plagued by controversy.

2024-01-31,BondBloxx launches triple B rated corporate bond ETFs,"Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools

BondBloxx has rolled out three ETFs that offer exposure to triple B rated corporate bonds.

The BBB Rated 1-5 Year Corporate Bond ETF, BBB Rated 5-10 Year Corporate Bond ETF and BBB Rated 10+ Year Corporate Bond ETF will target triple B rated corporate bonds within their respective maturity ranges, the company said in an announcement.

""While there are existing funds that target maturity ranges within investment-grade corporate bonds, these funds offer a new level of precision by enabling investors to target BBB-rated corporate bonds within various maturity ranges,"" the company said.

Over the past two decades, triple B rated corporate bonds have historically outperformed the broad investment-grade corporate bond universe by more than 50 basis points per year, ""with no incremental default risk"", the company said, citing Bloomberg data as of December 31.

""Investors who own broad investment-grade ETFs in different maturity categories can now use these new BondBloxx ETFs to target BBB-rated bonds and benefit from the higher coupon of this compelling segment within the investment-grade corporate bond market,"" BondBloxx co-founder Tony Kelly said in the release.

The three ETFs each have expense ratios of 19bp, prospectuses show.

BondBloxx co-founder and chief investment officer Elya Schwartzman is the sole portfolio manager on the ETFs.

He also manages the remaining 20 ETFs in BondBloxx's $2.5bn fixed income ETF suite, according to data from Morningstar Direct.

Investors piled $1.9bn into those ETFs during 2023, according to Morningstar data.

""We've identified BBB-rated corporate bonds as a persistent outperformer within the US investment-grade universe,"" said JoAnne Bianco, investment strategist at BondBloxx. ""That's been driven by their historically higher average coupon income compared to broad US corporates and also to US aggregate indices.""

Although the ETFs track indices, investors can use them as active strategies in terms of weightings, Bianco said.

""So instead of just a broad US corporate index strategy, you can decide where you want to be on the curve, and you can decide to focus on this credit quality in particular,"" she said. ""So, they're passive, but for an active strategy.""

The ETFs represent BondBloxx's foray into the investment-grade corporate bond universe, Bianco said, adding that the fixed-income ETF market has been ""underserved"" relative to equities in terms of choice.

Although BondBloxx is predicting ""another good year"" for fixed-income funds, investors should ""pick their spots,"" she said.

""We still really like high-yield corporates, but we also like BBB corporates,"" Bianco said. ""So, we think that these funds are really well-timed in terms of an area that we think is attractive for investors.""","BondBloxx has rolled out three ETFs that offer exposure to triple B rated corporate bonds.

2024-01-31,How Emily Weiss is fixing Glossier,"Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

In a private dining room of a hotel in Soho, London, Emily Weiss, founder of cult US beauty brand Glossier, is hosting a lunch for a new pop‑up shop. All the cool-girl hallmarks are here: the box-fresh hotel no one's been to before; the sold-out-within-minutes Phoebe Philo gold chain around Weiss's neck; the select guest list of beauty editors and tastemakers. But this time it's not a solo show for Weiss. Today, by her side is Glossier's CEO, Kyle Leahy, less than two years in the role, currently working the room. And while it might be Weiss's finger on the pulse, as Glossier prepares to enter its second decade, it's very much Leahy's finger that's pushing the buttons.

For those yet to slick their brows into place with Boy Brow (£18), who haven't queued around the block to buy a Glossier-emblazoned hoodie (£55), and don't have a 14-year-old to update them on Glossier's latest TikTok exploits (TikTok views of #glossier doubled from 1.2bn to 2.4bn in just nine months last year after it launched in multi-beauty retailer Sephora in February), here's the story. In 2010, a 25-year-old former Condé Nast intern and occasional reality-show star starts a blog in her spare time, Into The Gloss, in which she interviews people (some of them famous) about the top shelf of their bathroom cabinets. On the back of its success, she develops a line of products in cute millennial pink packaging, and calls it Glossier. Launched in 2014, into a world of Kardashian-inspired make-up whose fans were busy contouring their faces as if their life depended on it, Glossier gained popularity as a beauty brand for ""normal"" people. But normal people who were actually quite cool. By 2019 Glossier was valued at $1.2bn.

What could possibly go wrong? A global pandemic for starters. All bricks-and-mortar stores were closed, followed by a first round of redundancies that would eventually (by 2022) see one-third of corporate staff losing their jobs. There were also missteps: Play, the bright, sexy line of colour cosmetics launched in 2019 that quietly closed within a year of launch. An app that never saw the light of day. Then a cultural reckoning following the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, when the brand's retail culture was widely criticised by former employees on an Instagram account, @outtathegloss. Despite a public apology and a Grant Program for Black-owned beauty businesses with investment of $1.4mn, by 2021 Glossier's sales in the US were down 26 per cent. (The whole episode was documented in the much-publicised Glossy: Ambition, Beauty, and the Inside Story of Emily Weiss's Glossier by Marisa Meltzer, to the delight of Weiss's detractors, in September last year.)

Leahy, a Harvard Business graduate with previous roles at Cole Haan and Nike, first joined Glossier as chief commercial officer in 2021, the year after Glossier's image had begun to look tarnished. She stepped up to CEO in May 2022. She recognised that while Glossier's community had grown through the first wave of social media - when algorithms weren't so complex - this wasn't the key to its success. ""Glossier was disruptive; a pioneer. Its integration of social platforms and direct-to-consumer beauty had been so important to the way the brand could connect and foster conversations,"" says Leahy. But, ""we did a lot of soul-searching and it was very clear that our superpower is that we are a beauty brand, not a tech company. Tech might have been the means by which we connected with the community, but it's not the reason people come to us now.

""The reality is that marketplaces evolve, channels evolve,"" she continues. ""And over the past decade the consumer has evolved pretty significantly."" The Glossier consumer, notably, began to come from a much wider age range. ""When I launched the brand I was surrounded by peers,"" says Weiss. ""And now, you know, it's 40-, 50-year-old women and their kids."" But Weiss is not keen to dwell on where they might have gone wrong; her focus is on changes that will securely root the future of Glossier: ""This is my life's work. I still believe that this will be the brand forever...""

Leahy and Weiss made the decision to move away from an exclusively direct-to-consumer, single-channel model that had initially proved to be so distinctive, and disruptive, towards wholesale. In the process, Weiss decided to step back as CEO in order to make way for Leahy, writing a letter to her ""community"" in which she talked about asking herself: ""Am I the best person to lead the company, for where we are and where we're headed? And if not, who is?"" She became executive chairwoman of the brand.

Leahy had to make hard decisions from the get-go. ""We had to do some restructuring. It's something you never take lightly but you do it with the lens of what's best for the long term,"" she says. Evolving the single-channel direct-to-consumer approach also meant pushing to become more global. Glossier now ships to more than 180 countries. ""It's that same bigness and openness that [originally] drew people in, and allows us to tap into the emotional zeitgeist and have a multigenerational appeal,"" says Leahy.

More than 18 months on, retail sales for the brand - which now has 11 bricks-and-mortar stores around the world - are up 50 per cent year on year, with 2023 the second consecutive year of growth. Balm Dotcom tinted lip balm (£14) frequently sells out; the deodorant (£22) was at one time reported to have an 18,000-strong waiting list; while the fragrance Glossier You (£57 for 50ml, and which is designed to smell just like, well, you) is currently (as reported in October) the number-one seller in the US at Sephora. A bottle sells every 40 seconds. On the surface, the move into Sephora looks to have paid off, with sales consistently 50 to 70 per cent above forecast. The goal of surpassing $100mn in a year was reached.

Industry insiders are, for the most part, positive. John Demsey, former Estée Lauder executive, says: ""I believe the positioning work led by the new team, coupled with the expansion to brand equity, building distribution like Sephora, has made the connection with the new emerging beauty generation."" Others point to the opportunity in terms of global sales, where Glossier has barely scratched the surface; the brand's massive social-media following counts 50 per cent outside the US, many in areas that have only recently opened up to shipping.

Glossier's C-Suite is all-female. ""I naively assumed that the beauty industry would be more female-led,"" says Leahy. ""And it was astonishing. Looking at the top 20 beauty companies in Europe, only three of them are led by a woman. The lack of representation [at the top] in a $500bn industry that has been built around women looking and feeling a certain way is shocking.""

The Covent Garden store, in London, next door to Apple, is the brand's most successful. And once you get over the fact that the smiling staff look a bit like your average babysitter (young, cheery, a little bit on the scruffy side), what still impresses is just how many big-hitting products there are. The riot of colour and texture (take the touchy-feeliness of the exfoliating body soap); the quirky yet relatable names; and all its ensuing theatre, such as the conveyor belt that delivers your purchases. (Although, it has to be said, the cardboard handles on the bags are really uncomfortable.)

Is this what happens when a 25-year-old grows up with her ""community""? Now 38, Weiss is still the embodiment of someone doing what she loves. Given that she is the mother of a 19-month-old girl, while Leahy is the mother of a girl and a boy aged five and two, I wonder if the multigenerational direction of Glossier and its goal to be a ""100-year-old brand"" will mean that their children will one day step into the firm, much like the families of Estée Lauder or Clarins? ""I've let her play with the beauty bag and she's putting it all on,"" laughs Weiss. ""And there's been that moment as a parent where I've thought, 'Should I encourage this?' And I've asked myself, 'What would Glossier do?' And I think Glossier would say, 'Have fun. Use as little or as much as you want. Go for it.'"" Leahy nods. ""If our girls grow up feeling more confident about themselves... That's a gift for the next generation. And that is why we do what we do.""","Emily Weiss is the founder of cult beauty brand Glossier. She founded the brand in 2010 and is now CEO. By 2023, Glosier's sales in the US were down 26 per cent.

Dealing with the grief of a bereavement at work can be extremely difficult, both for the person suffering a loss, and for those around them. So how can you make life a little easier for grieving colleagues? How can you best support them while respecting their privacy? And how can you ensure bereavement-related absences don't make life harder for other colleagues? Isabel Berwick speaks to Andy Langford, clinical director of bereavement charity Cruse for some practical tips on dealing with workplace grief. Later, she talks to Gabriella Braun, director of workplace consultancy Working Well. Gabriella explains that grief goes beyond death; we can feel grief in any number of workplace scenarios.

2024-01-30,"I, sommelier","Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

You only need to see the way a wine list gets hot-potatoed around a restaurant table to realise choosing wine still makes most people anxious. And there will never be enough good sommeliers and wine merchants in the world to make that pain go away. Pam Dillon, co-founder and CEO of wine app Preferabli, believes AI could hold the answer. And after more than $22mn of investment and a decade of development, the former investment banker is taking her idea to the world.

Dillon is an energetic New Yorker in jazzy feline glasses; her current drinks of choice are Armagnac Old Fashioneds, peated whisky and orange wine. ""When I was at Goldman Sachs, I was at least as well-known for my ability to choose wine and spirits for the closing dinners as I was for any of the technology transactions I did,"" she says. ""I was always really focused on the preferences of individual clients, because I wanted to stand out in a landscape that was very competitive.""

Dillon had the idea for Preferabli in 2007, ""long before anyone was talking about AI. I couldn't shake the idea that we could bring together supply and demand in the world of wine and spirits in the context of individual preference. How could we codify the whole thing?""

Preferabli's raw material is a proprietary database of more than two million (and counting) wines, spirits and beers, which have been evaluated by a team of real-life Masters of Wine and Master Sommeliers for more than 800 different characteristics. These range from the technical (grape variety, vineyard elevation, alcohol level) to qualitative (balance, finesse) and gustatory (floral, herbal, smoky). This ""algorithm food"", as Dillon terms it, is then overlaid with a whole host of generative AI capabilities, which allow users to rate wines and spirits, and receive ever-more accurate recommendations based on their own personal tastes.

It's access to this database that makes Preferabli superior to other wine apps such as Vivino, says Dillon, which ""makes recommendations for wines based upon what other users think of them. Vivino also has deals with retailers and offers wines for sale based on revenue-sharing arrangements,"" she adds.

I tried the free consumer app (which is still a work-in‑progress) and found it a bit clunky, but the champagne recommendations it gave me after I'd plugged in a few favourites were a good mix of grandes marques and more esoteric growers. When it came to Japanese malts, though, it stuck rather drily to a few big names. A paid-for version of the app, which unlocks the database's full capabilities, will be forthcoming. For now, Preferabli's focus is licensing its software to trade. Dillon envisions a world where ""[hotels, restaurants, etcetera] have a profile of guests or diners when they check in - increasingly many hospitality venues and reservation websites do - which shows what they've ordered in the past and their preferences, based on their Preferabli interaction. So the sommelier can then go to the table with the ability to have a completely different conversation about the wine.

""Alternatively, the guest can use their smartphone to click on a QR code that takes them to a website that has the venue's drinks list pre-loaded with all the Preferabli functionalities built in. This is an increasingly popular option partly because it's very, very hard to get that kind of labour [ie, trained sommeliers] right now."" Preferabli can re-order a restaurant's wine list in line with a guest's own preferences, or take more adventurous drinkers off-piste. Excitingly, it will soon also be able to rate wines according to their environmental impact, using data such as air miles, carbon footprint, viticultural methods and bottle weight. (If a venue has wines not already on the Preferabli database, then the team will track them down and get them tasted - unless, I presume, it's some kind of crazily rare and expensive wine, in which case a wine recommendation app is probably not what's required.)

""We didn't build this platform to replace sommeliers,"" says Dillon, ""but to extend what they do and to eliminate those things they don't want to do. We still expect you to say to the sommelier, 'Preferabli has suggested these three wines, now tell me what you think.'""

Preferabli has already been licensed to retailers and hospitality venues in more than 70 countries, and presented its tech at Harvard, Stanford, Cambridge and Oxford universities. Plans are now underway to roll the software out into other ""sensory product"" markets, including fragrance and cheese.

Personally, I'm a bit depressed by the idea of a dining room full of guests squinting at glowing screens - but it's hard not to be inspired by Preferabli's possibilities. Will it spell the end for the flesh-and-blood sommelier? ""I sincerely hope not,"" says Dillon. ""I don't believe - at least in our lifetime - that AI can ever replace that human ability to deeply connect with a person; to understand how they're feeling and how they want to feel."" I must admit, when I hear this, I feel just a bit relieved.","Pam Dillon, co-founder and CEO of wine app Preferabli, believes AI could hold the answer.

2024-01-30,France turns up heat on Brussels to address farmer protests,"Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

France is increasing pressure on the European Commission to address complaints raised by protesting farmers, including about imports from Ukraine and a trade deal being negotiated with Latin American countries.

As farmers in France continue to blockade highways and disrupt food supplies, President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday pledged to defend their interests ""not by opposing or pointing to Europe as the culprit"" but by asking for EU policy reforms. ""At the European level, we must have a policy that is consistent with the food sovereignty that we defend.""

Macron reiterated France's long-standing concerns that a free trade deal with the Mercosur group of countries -- Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay -- would lead to imports that do not respect European standards, such as on antibiotic usage on chicken farms. ""We ask that the agreement as it is in place not be signed,"" he said.

Macron's comments come as farmers in France protest about rising costs, falling profits and new regulations as Brussels tries to cut carbon emissions and improve biodiversity. Similar protests are also starting in Belgium where farmers on Tuesday moved to block a key port, while German farmers have also blocked motorways and prevented a minister from disembarking a ferry.

Among farmers' grievances are local and EU regulations, while in France, Poland, Slovakia and Romania, they have also objected to cheaper imports from Ukraine flooding their markets. After the Russian invasion in 2022, the EU agreed to lift tariffs on Ukrainian grain and produce, which have lower production costs and do not have to follow EU standards.

On the issue of agricultural imports from Ukraine, another irritant for farmers, Macron said he would raise it at the summit as well because they were ""destabilising the European market"" for chicken and eggs.

Poland and Hungary have for several months imposed unilateral import bans on grain and some other foodstuffs from Ukraine, which can only transit their territory on the way to other markets. The EU countries neighbouring Ukraine are pushing for extra safeguards when the bloc renews its deal with Kyiv for another year from June.

The commission is expected to propose parameters for a renewal of the trade measures on Wednesday and discussions continue on whether to include quotas on eggs, poultry meat and sugar. One EU diplomat said any quotas would cap imports at the average annual level of 2022 and 2023. Poland is expected to lift its embargo if this is agreed.

The farmers' protests, and the desire for EU governments to extract concessions from Brussels required to placate them, were set to gatecrash an EU leaders' summit on Thursday designed to focus on aid to Ukraine. Macron said he would meet the head of the commission, Ursula von der Leyen, to discuss agricultural and trade issues on the sidelines of the summit.

Leaders from countries with farmer protests are co-ordinating ahead of the summit, people briefed on the discussions told the FT, and would bring a united front demanding flexibility from the commission.

Among the concerns raised at protests across the bloc is the rigidity of rules governing what agricultural activities are eligible for EU subsidies. ""Farmers across the EU need support if they are going to be a part of the green transition,"" said one of the people. ""So it's a co-ordinated approach between capitals [ahead of the summit].""

Brussels hands around €60bn annually to farmers through the Common Agricultural Policy, in what is the biggest single chunk of the EU budget, and it has been tightening green standards to qualify for the subsidies.

The commission appeared to cede on one demand made recently by France and a coalition that Paris said included 22 member states: to push back the reintroduction of an EU requirement for farmers to leave 4 to 7 per cent of their land fallow to protect biodiversity. The rule had been suspended since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine to boost farm production, but was supposed take effect this year.

Von der Leyen's spokesman Eric Mamer on Tuesday said the commission would renew the exemption to allow farmers to plant on the land. The exact details might change, he said.

On the Mercosur trade deal, Mamer said talks would continue despite France's renewed push against it, but added that an agreement was not imminent. ""The negotiations are ongoing but we are not there,"" he said.

EU officials suggested the talks could be strung out beyond June elections for the European parliament, and wait for the political heat to die down.

France, the biggest agricultural producer in the EU, has long opposed finalising a deal provisionally agreed in 2019 but Macron has been increasingly vocal about it in recent months, arguing that the pact would be bad for the environment and French farmers. In other EU countries too, agriculture groups have objected to the deal's increased quotas for meat and produce from Latin America.

Trade commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis in December told the FT he could push the deal through without France given that it requires support from a majority of member states, not unanimity.

Other member states including Germany, Spain and Sweden are in favour of the deal. ""We still hope negotiations will continue and French tractors in the street won't stop it,"" said an EU diplomat.

""The vast majority of member states want this deal. We are concerned about these reports,"" said another.",France is increasing pressure on the European Commission to address complaints raised by farmers.

2024-01-30,Volodymyr Zelenskyy prepares to replace Ukraine's top general,"Simply sign up to the War in Ukraine myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is preparing to replace his top general in what would be the biggest shake-up of Ukraine's military command since Russia's full-scale invasion began two years ago.

Zelenskyy on Monday offered Valeriy Zaluzhny, commander-in-chief of the armed forces, a new role as a defence adviser but the general refused, according to four people familiar with the discussions.

Two of them said Zelenskyy had made clear to Zaluzhny that regardless of whether he took the role, he would be removed from his current position.

The four people said that while a decision had been made in Zelenskyy's office to dismiss Zaluzhny, he may not be ousted for some time after reports of the plans appeared in Ukrainian media.

The president's offer of a new role to the general follows months of speculation about his fate, fed by reports of tension between the two men.

Their strained relationship spilled into the open in November after Ukraine's much-hyped counteroffensive failed to achieve its ambitious goals of retaking lost territory and cutting off Russia's land bridge to Crimea.

At the time, Zaluzhny said that the war had reached a ""stalemate"", leading the president's office to castigate him for using the term.

On Monday, Zelenskyy's spokesperson, Serhiy Nykyforov, and the defence ministry denied reports about Zaluzhny's dismissal.

""Dear journalists, we immediately answer everyone: No, this is not true,"" the ministry wrote on its Telegram channel without providing additional context. The president's office declined to comment further on Tuesday.

The removal of Zaluzhny would also cause an uproar within Ukraine's rank-and-file military and civil society, among whom he enjoys huge support.

In a Ukrainian poll released in December, 88 per cent of Ukrainians said they trusted Zaluzhny compared with 62 per cent who said they trusted Zelenskyy.

""This will have a very, very negative impact on the [morale] of the army,"" Ukrainian military historian Mykhailo Zhyrokhov told Kyiv's Radio NV, who added that he believed the rumours to be ""fabrication"".

Replacing Zaluzhny could also unnerve Ukraine's western partners, including military officials who have worked closely with the general over the past two years to devise battlefield strategies.

The war is at a critical juncture as Kyiv waits to see whether it will receive billions of dollars' worth of critical military and financial assistance from the US and the EU.

Zaluzhny has not commented on the reports of his dismissal. On Monday, however, he published an undated selfie with his chief of the general staff Serhiy Shaptala on Facebook in which both were wearing Ukrainian army sweatshirts.

Reports of Zaluzhny's imminent ousting began circulating on Monday evening in local media and on anonymous local Telegram channels. They also appeared in public comments from politicians closely aligned with former president Petro Poroshenko, whom Zelenskyy defeated in the 2019 election.

According to all four people with knowledge of the issue, it is currently unclear who would replace Zaluzhny as commander-in-chief.

Possible candidates are Oleksandr Syrsky, the commander of Ukraine's ground forces, and Kyrylo Budanov, the head of the country's military intelligence directorate. Both men are close to Zelenskyy.

Ukrainian news outlet Mirror of the Week also reported the discussions around Zaluzhny's possible dismissal, citing sources in Zelenskyy's office. Several other media cited sources who said that Zaluzhny had already been dismissed or would be let go imminently.

A four-star career military man dubbed the ""Iron General"" by admirers, Zaluzhny, 50, was appointed by Zelenskyy to the post of commander-in-chief in July 2021. He has overseen Ukraine's military's operations since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.

He is credited with orchestrating several of Ukraine's military successes, including the defence of Kyiv in the first days of Russia's invasion, and the successful counteroffensives in the eastern Kharkiv region and the southern regional capital of Kherson in autumn 2022.

Zelenskyy has reportedly sought to keep Zaluzhny, whom he viewed as a potential competitor, out of the public eye and bypassed him during key moments of the war by communicating orders to the general's subordinates.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is preparing to replace his top general. Zaluzhny, commander-in-chief of the armed forces, was offered a new role. The general refused, according to four people familiar with the discussions.","[('zelenskyy', 0.5884), ('zaluzhny', 0.4985), ('volodymyr', 0.2965), ('replace', 0.2853), ('ukrainian', 0.274), ('general', 0.2694), ('president', 0.2606), ('commander', 0.2301), ('chief', 0.2115), ('refused', 0.162)]","zelenskyy, zaluzhny, volodymyr, replace, ukrainian, general, president, commander, chief, refused",40

If I asked you to think of what an investor might look like, chances are you might conjure up the image of my guest on the podcast today. A man, of course, sharply dressed as befitting a stockbroker in the City of London, with a pair of bright red braces holding up his pinstripe trousers. I am talking, of course, about Justin Urquhart-Stewart known to millions as Mr. Red Braces thanks to his many TV appearances over the years, explaining the ups and downs of the investment world. However, don't let appearances deceive you. Justin might look like a city insider, but he has long argued that investing is something that should matter more to all of us, no matter how much or how little we have to invest. Plus, his views on the investment industry are bound to surprise you. Welcome to Money Clinic, the FT's weekly podcast about personal finance and investing. I'm Claer Barrett, the FT's consumer editor.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

I've often shared a radio or TV studio with my guest today, but this is the first time I've shared the full podcast studio with him, and he's joining us for an investment masterclass. Welcome, Justin.

Justin Urquhart-Stewart

Thank you. This is very exciting. Yeah.

Claer Barrett

It is very exciting. And I mean, you have a long and distinguished City career, which we're going to shortly. But it's the red braces and the red tie that people really remember for you. And I'm glad to see that you're sporting them today. But where did this start?

Justin Urquhart-Stewart

It keeps his trousers up, to start with. So the main thing, of course, is actually making sure it's not actually being cheap and available. For everyone who tries to comment, try and do that. No, it's a part of me, some of the braces of my father's. But then you suddenly realise that you would have got these braces that because they actually buttoned on to the trousers, once they're there, they stay there forever. And so, you know, once you just have more trousers, more red braces turn up. And so it turns almost into a sort of brand. So I suppose don't knock it if people notice these red braces. I've been called a lot worse.

Claer Barrett

Well, more recently, you're known as the finance expert with the cats. Tell us about that one.

Justin Urquhart-Stewart

Well, yes. This is one of the issues that comes about when you start trying to do filming from home and, filming from home with my dear Burmese cats, who for some reason, seem to have an amazing ability to identify when an interview is about to occur, particularly on a Zoom. And so there's no sign of any cat anywhere. But within five minutes of a Zoom starting, I'm aware of some paws trying to go up my trouser leg. Now, either I can try and deal with a cat, in which case I'll get reported to the Cat Defence League, or I have to lift the cat up, and he or she, because there are three of them, will sit on my shoulder and hopefully purr quietly. But, will sit there, and if I'm going on too long, will start putting their claws into me. In which case the answers tend to get shorter, as does my patience with them as well.

Claer Barrett

Well, a fantastic piece of branding, red braces and a Burmese cat. Now let's talk about the career of the person, the cat and the braces who are attached to you. Now, you started off training as a barrister, but you ended up entering the financial world. You spent much of your career at Barclays, where you specialise in personal investing. How did this journey happen?

Justin Urquhart-Stewart

Well, I would have been the world's worst barrister had I actually done it at all. My pupil master when I was doing my training said, Justin, you realise there's more money in crime than defending it? So on that basis, I thought, well, where's the best crime you can go to? Well, quite obviously, financial services, that sort of, you know, polite crime, if nothing else. And also my family was never been known for much of doing to the financial services. So I thought, it's about time I should try and learn something about it. And actually, it's interesting because when you come with it a completely as a novice, a new and objective view of it, you don't come with all the baggage and actually what's happened before, because what you find when you go into the city in those days pre-big bang, you suddenly come across this old history. Oh, this is the way we've always done it, and this is the right way of doing it. It was a cartel, self-serving and, frankly, ripe for revolution.

Claer Barrett

Obviously happened with the Big Bang in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher, I mean, the Big Bang is a phrase that listeners might have heard about. Why was it important? What does it mean?

Justin Urquhart-Stewart

Well, what it did was actually broke apart the old cartel of stockbrokers and jobbers, stockjobbers, we know them as now as market makers and this cosy little world that they had between themselves and started bringing in outside investments. So what does that mean? Well, it meant banks, who else would be stupid enough to invest in these firms, and so primarily the American banks, and they could see, oh, well, here's the London market, very international, much more international than anyone else in the world, we'll invest into this. And then also being able to put together merchant banks or investment banks with these stockjobbers, with broking firms. And so you had all the main banks actually pouring large amounts of money in comparison with today, which sounds relatively small, but in those days there's a lot of money investing in things they didn't really understand. So whether it was Barclays or NatWest or whatever, they spent a fortune buying these broking firms, jobbing firms and putting together with a, with a merchant bank as well, and they nearly all failed. Absolutely dismal. Why? Because the bankers themselves didn't know what was going on. They didn't understand it. And I even know one particular broking firm who, when they sold themselves to, I shouldn't say it but Barclays, didn't actually disclose all their assets, so they hadn't got much in the way of assets because they were all partnerships. In fact, the only asset they had was a very large wine cellar. But because Barclays never asked about it, they never told them about it. So Barclays didn't even get that. So it was a fiasco. It opened up the market, and it became much more international, put more capital into it.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Claer Barrett

Now, you're naturally suited to working in businesses that a client facing with retail investors, but usually love to explain what investing is and why it's important. And you do it in a very witty and amusing way on the television in your red braces. But your career took a bit of a turn just after 2001, where you decided to leave Barclays where you've been there for many years, very successful, and set up with seven others your own firm, 7 Investment Management. Now, tell us a little bit more about that. And also if it's true that to get the money together, you all remortgaged your houses and hoped for the best.

Justin Urquhart-Stewart

Well, I've always had a bit of an interesting history at Barclays over the years. Originally I joined Barclays DCO, Dominion, Colonial and Overseas, so you get sent over to other parts of the world almost carrying a solar topi and a big book on how to run a bank. And I ended up going to Uganda. And you sit there and hang on, there's a war going on and you have to go and see one of these directors of Barclays, they said, exactly. We need more people out there, it's like an edition of Blackadder. Unfortunately, I had a slight technical hitch there, and after a few months, I had to come back because there was a coup. And unfortunately, I got caught up in the coup. So with one leg slightly shorter than the other, I returned back to Britain. It wasn't a very good idea. And then about a couple of years later when they put me back together again, I ended up in Singapore. But that allowed me to understand more about international trade and how that worked. And again, not investment, but really understanding of the importance of how to simplify trade so people understand it. So coming back to Britain, this was then when Big Bang was coming through, it was obvious then to get involved in the retail side of that because we had the privatisations and again with privatisations people didn't really understand what was going on and the government's priced the goods to go. So just about going to make money.

Claer Barrett

This is buying shares in British Telecom.

Justin Urquhart-Stewart

Exactly. And tell Sid to go get some more British Gas shares. And people did it because they made short-term money out of it. Unfortunately, what happened, so they bought and then promptly sold them again and made a quick profit. And they thought, well, maybe that's what a stock exchange, stockbroking is about. Of course, it's not. But you could educate people and say, here's a start. Now, let's take it further. And another good idea was setting up the investment clubs so people would actually save relatively small amounts of money, not because they're going to make a fortune out of it, but if you lose £50, it's fine. If you lose £2,000, that's not fine. But you can understand how shares worked.

Claer Barrett

Learning by doing.

Justin Urquhart-Stewart

Learning by doing . . . and with a group of chums doing it, we started off as chums anyway, and meeting once a month, having a drink, that actually became really quite successful. And, you know, it's gone off out of fashion now. But again, it's one of those things I would always urge people to have a go. Not treating it as a game. You can enjoy it and engage in it without taking a huge amount of risk.

Claer Barrett

Hmmm Workspace, the modern-day equivalent, when some of my younger friends are in WhatsApp groups to talk about investing. And one of them will have an idea and they'll send it to the group and it will either get shot down in flames or people will start doing their own research on it, saying, well, actually, that's not a bad argument for buying this company, but let's look at some of the reasons not to buy it.

Justin Urquhart-Stewart

Exactly. So all of that then meant, you could see we didn't have the technology in those days, so the 2000 to 2001, my business partner, myself, we were running Barclays Stockbrokers, and Barclays Stockbrokers (inaudible) had taken over a business with set up called Broker Services, which was a white-labelled version of people running different stock brokers and didn't know how to run it so we just put our label on their label on the front of it. Barclays then ended up buying it, which was fine, but it meant that was the third time I was working for Barclays. I resigned three times for them, and so unfortunately, they decided they wanted to introduce an inactivity fee, which is quite clever, to get charged for doing something and you get charged for doing nothing. So Tom and I thought, (inaudible). So we sort of say . . .

Claer Barrett

Tom is . . .

Justin Urquhart-Stewart

. . . My business partner who's a very un-American American. And, he, so he's decided that was the wrong thing to do. So yes, we tried to go and set up 7 Investment Management. We all had to, yes, had put mortgages on our house. Luckily, I'd actually bought a flat a few years before as well, so I had to actually sell that. And there you are. You start from scratch, and you have to sit down and have a discussion with the family and say, by the way, chaps, if I don't have a great deal of money for a while because these were difficult times, you didn't pay us a fortune. And it's a very interesting exercise to test people as to how well their understanding and patience and, really, are they willing to be with you to go through those bad times? How do you cope with the other side and you get your money back? And that's fine. And it teaches you about the tough side of capitalism, but how successful it can also be.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Claer Barrett

Now, it's been more than 20 years since you did quit your job at Barclays and set up 7 Investment Management. Of course 7 Investment Management, the firm, carries on although you sold out a couple of years ago, which is one of the reasons why you do have more time to focus on your big passion topic, financial literacy because you love talking about money and investing. That is what makes you a great broadcaster. Then I've seen you at events just talking to people in the room who were investors, asking them questions, finding out what their experiences are and listening to what they want. If you had to go into a school for Flic, that's the FT's financial literacy and inclusion campaign or charity, and deliver a money lesson to a class of indifferent teenagers, shall we say, what would you talk about to them?

Justin Urquhart-Stewart

Two things you can go about, a, just talk about some of the history of financial cock-ups over the years. And these go right the way back to Roman days and things like that, or even the Dutch getting so excited that they actually managed to invest in tulip bulbs and what happened there. And the host went disastrously wrong. So there's nothing new about financial disasters. We're very good at finance disasters. Actually, the Romans were actually much better at managing their banks far more effectively because it's very simple. If you're the person running what their equivalent as a bank was and they weren't doing it very well, you were killed.

Claer Barrett

I can't see the FCA introducing that.

Justin Urquhart-Stewart

Well, no, but it would have meant actually part of the Royal Bank of Scotland would have had that same problem. And probably the chap running it who, you know, probably would be a little more circumspect over what he's going to be doing with the investments. Now, but the point is, I'm afraid investment corruption and theft and such like is not new at all. So go back and teach people actually what happened with that. But then also say, right, let's take our position of your family and you just draw a picture of your family. And what does the average British family consist of. Now, as individuals, you've only got a certain amount of money. Actually, how much is your family worth if you put it together? They may not speak to each other, but OK, let's just imagine what they've, some have got houses, and as a family, you could actually manage your debt far more easily. A lot more people are going to be sitting there saying I can't get a mortgage, I don't qualify, I don't have a deposit for a mortgage. The family does. So actually start saying, right, draw me your family and we'll just actually take your family, take it through this and see actually what your families worth. Then what we'll do is take some of those assets and we'll pretend that we can actually get a return of x per cent, 7 per cent and what that's going to be worth over time. And over time, we're going to get to that figure. And what's that going to give you as a family in terms of your pension for the next 10 years. And so you can make it into something which is fun, interesting, turn into a game, but behind it is something which is logical and sound. And nearly all the times I find myself in schools talking about it, I find myself talking to the parents of the kids because they once told them do that. And then it comes, it comes alive to become something which we've all had to experience. But without the technical language or the patronising get, particularly patronising getting very (inaudible).

Claer Barrett

Well, Justin, I'm just going to play devil's advocate here a bit. I mean, obviously, we all know about how the Bank of Mum and Dad is funding a good number of first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder. I think more and more in the cost of living crisis people are having problems. They are going to their families, to their parents, their grandparents, their siblings and asking to be helped over a financial bump in the road. But then there are some people whose families can't help them, can't afford to. They aren't there. There are a single-parent family, could be somebody who's recently arrived in this country and is having to send money home. I mean, how would you make that kind of lesson relevant for them?

Justin Urquhart-Stewart

Same thing in many ways in terms of that, let's scale it right way down to you as an individual. I'm on my own. I've arrived here all I've got, hopefully I got somewhere to live, but I've got to pay some rent on that, I got a job going. What are the priorities I've got to have? Do I have people to look after here or back in my home country, and do I have to send money back? So what I need to be able to do is just start writing down a little financial plan because what it does is once you've written down in terms, what have I got to achieve, what have I got coming in, what I've got going out, it gives you that one word that runs any economy, whether you're ICI or whether you're just I, that is confidence. And you have that confidence to say, at least I know what I've got.

Claer Barrett

I know where I am.

Justin Urquhart-Stewart

(Inaudible) I know I haven't got. At least I know what have I got. So then you can say, right, OK, so if I start putting that much aside I've got a little bit more money saved. I can actually start doing some more with it. And over actually a few months it starts building up, and it's amazing actually. Oh, just over a few months, suddenly the things begin to change. You suddenly start having a bit more confidence. I'm not wealthy, but I'm a bit stronger than I was before. And it gives them control of it as opposed to the fear of actually say, oh, I've got to pay off the, that other loan coming through, or someone's going to be banging on the door for it and getting people away from that, from the, that financial scum you don't want to be dealing with. But also there are people who could be really helpful, like some of the credit unions, which you barely ever get to hear about. You can provide you with not information, but good access to cheap finance and reasonable saving and savings (inaudible) and you start having a better understanding yourself. Give you some of that confidence. So start building up you as an individual doing it and maybe talk to some friends about it, and you'll find exactly the same position. And very quickly, and it will just take several months, and suddenly you got a few hundred quid building up, and you think, actually, I could start doing this.

Claer Barrett

Now, people who are investing regularly, we know that that's lots of people who listen to this podcast do, even if it is small sums of money. But another problem that I've talked to you a lot about over the years is the advice gap. These people who have some money to invest, but they can't afford the services of a financial adviser or a wealth manager to give them help and advice about what to do. Now, to all of the people listening who are going down the DIY route, what pearls of wisdom would you impart to them?

Justin Urquhart-Stewart

What you need to be able to have, actually, in my view, is actually a financial planner, helps you plan doing things. So not so much in investing, what are the bits you need to have in place, what are the Lego bricks I need to have in order to start growing things, insurance, mortgage protection, all those sort of things as opposed to just straightforward investing. So you can't afford the advice yourself, the wealth manager, so number one, maybe it's the family that could actually do so. Certainly, a family in Scotland, used to be an old, used to be the sort of family lawyer was the, we used to go to who tried, they weren't very good, but at least it co-ordinated some of the legal aspects together. Certainly you could do that with financial planners now to co-ordinate that family, and so the cost is shared across them. Now, if you're an individual, you can't afford that, good news is actually there are a lot of good places you can go to, like the FT to be able to get information which is credible information and directions what to do and advice lines where you can write in or call in and get some views and opinions. So you have to put in some homework. But the good news is never before have you had quite so much information and commentary available. The bad news is you've actually got to go and find it and make sure you're talking to the right people. And again, that's where AI comes in, you're never quite sure are you always talking to the right people? Check it, and you will find out quite quickly.

Claer Barrett

Now, your style of dress, Justin, people might associate you with conventional investments like stocks and shares. But I wondered what you think of bitcoin.

Justin Urquhart-Stewart

Oh, I'm absolutely outrageous. There is something which has been dreamt up as a computer algorithm. Highly expensive to run and develop, takes an enormous amount of electrical power, so environmentally it's dreadful. It's tradable, but it goes up and down like a yo-yo the entire time. The regulators are being sort of forced to try and run it. But unfortunately what's happened is because youngsters have come in and said, look what I could do with this, I could trade this very easily goes up and down. They think this is investing. No, it's punting, and it's punting on something which is potentially very dangerous.

Claer Barrett

But they think it could make them rich.

Justin Urquhart-Stewart

Exactly. So, but I'd regard that as financial version of horseracing without the fun. No, investing does have various disciplines to it, some which may say in comparison sounds quite dull, but it's slow and steady over time. I have no problem at all with some wants to go and have a punt on something, say even bitcoin if they wish, but it's with a tiny amount of money. What's the definition of tiny amount of money amount? Amount they can afford to lose. So we need much more education to people understand what goes on, and the regulators need to be sharp as well. We need regulators to be proactive.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Claer Barrett

In reality, every investor makes mistakes. How can we learn from these?

Justin Urquhart-Stewart

Me too. Do I buy things which have gone wrong from time to time? The answer's yes. And so the answer is from experience, listening to others who asks you what's happened? Also some common sense. Too good to be true and all that usual line. And so it is that, that sort of experience, the more you can learn from others, which is why things like investment clubs can be useful, you can actually learn to steer clear of it. Quite often you see every year there will be another area of the market or geographical area where suddenly everyone's pour money into. Over the past few years. China was a great place to invest in until you actually saw actually how China was running some of their markets.

Claer Barrett

ESG more recent.

Justin Urquhart-Stewart

Oh, ESG, yes. You have the environmental, sustainable and governance. Everyone says that's a great thing to have. Or does it turn into a sort of greenwash? It's just become a fashion fad.

Claer Barrett

These vogue investment. What about AI? It's a more recent buzz word.

Justin Urquhart-Stewart

Yes. And of course so, AI, but what do you actually mean? And I was terrified when I actually looked at some of the school kids, and they had already been using AI for the past year or so, the chatbot and things like that, to be able to actually get their essays written. I thought this was for the future. No, it's already operating now. And so AI takes things into a different dimension where you have to be really careful about what you're reading, where it's from, and who's to say that someone isn't actually going to be using AI to rewrite what you've just been saying? So how do you regulate it? I have to say, I don't have an easy answer to that. You're just going to have to make sure your cynicism levels, antenna, are very, very sharp indeed.

Claer Barrett

And any rules of thumb for investors that you like to highlight?

Justin Urquhart-Stewart

Basic, basic things. I know, first of all, do you understand what's going on? If you don't understand it, don't do it. Some simple, straightforward logic, not as an investment adviser or anything like that, just sit there and say this needs to make sense to me. So you remain such a common sense. Just follow your nose and be surprised what happens. If it doesn't smell right, then also check with other people. There are lots of other people you can check things out with just to say, does this sound right?

Claer Barrett

With more conventional investments, tell me about the rule of 72.

Justin Urquhart-Stewart

There are some basic rules like this that I think are quite fun. The rule of 72 is divide into 72 the sort of percentage return you think you're going to get. So let's assume, we're not going to get this, but let's assume we get 10 per cent return. Fantastic. So 10 into 72 goes roughly 7. What it means is my money's going to double in seven years. So I can actually sit there and say, well, if I got this amount of money, then, so every seven years I've certainly gone for £100 as I got £200, £400. Now, if you're going to use this as a pension scheme, and you're going over 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, 40 years, 50 years. This makes a huge difference. So suppose you're getting, let's say 4, 5, 6, 7 per cent return after charges, which is quite feasible, say about 5 per cent. And if you can get getting 5 per cent, and over those decades, you can see with a rule of 72 how quickly it's growing, that's going to give you the comfort of knowing that by the time you do want to retire or have to retire, to actually say, actually, I got a reasonable sum here, and I can then see how long that's actually going to last me. So a simple little number like that can suddenly take away the horrors of, oh, I was thinking about the calculator. I don't know what I'm doing here. Just some simple maths like that, and actually, life becomes a lot easier.

Claer Barrett

But, I mean, I think even people listening who are investing into stocks and shares ISAs, they're being their own investment manager now in their 20s, 30s, 40s, they're building up this knowledge. It's not going to come the day where they're in the 50s and 60s and starting to access pensions or think about managing them in their retirement, where investment management is going to be a new thing for them. It's something that they're going to feel more comfortable and confident doing.

Justin Urquhart-Stewart

Absolutely. And of course, that they are the first generation who are actually in that position because their parents were never in that position. Now things have changed. Good news. We're loving living longer. Bad news we're living longer because now we've actually got to start actually paying for it. Because someone's changed the pension rules again, and they always do. So those pension responsibilities aren't down to the company, down to you. So you've got to now learn how to try and manage it. So everything that was there for your parents has now changed radically. So you can't blame them for not understanding it because it wasn't the same.

Claer Barrett

They didn't have anything to understand.

Justin Urquhart-Stewart

And it was a nice little world to live in, a little bit shorter lifespan. So now you've actually got to spend a lot more time trying to do it. And the good news is you've got more choice of things to do. But again, more choice means you've got a more understanding of what to do. What you want is something which is a predictable even, dare I say, as boring as possible. What you wanted to be able to do is get whatever pension plan or investment plan you've got trails up to go to ta-da . . . What? Where's it going? So taking the risk and mystery out of it, putting some fun into it, but fun only for a little bit because this is not, as I say, horseracing, but for help learning doing things.

Claer Barrett

Now, we've talked a lot about making financial plans, but of course, if there's one thing we can't plan is the ups and downs of life, and you are, Justin, somebody who really knows what it's like to be hit by a curve ball from accidents that you've had on archaeological digs in Uganda to more recent events, perhaps in your personal life. It's important to plan for the worst happening, but we also need to make sure that we enjoy life while we have it.

Justin Urquhart-Stewart

And this is where your investment is, to me, one of the most important things that liberates you to be able to say, I can have some fun and enjoy myself for this. Doesn't mean you're going to blow the whole lot, but you could then start spending, making sure I can book time aside and money aside to go do the things I want to do. None of us are going to sit there and just turn into some terrible Scrooge sitting there, putting money aside entire time and just hopefully having a pile of coppers actually rising. But you won't be able to use it, have some fun with a family of friends or socially and going out and doing some positive things. It's good for you. It's good for your family. A dare I say, sounds awfully it's a blurry, it's good for society as well.

2024-01-30,Transcript: China's not so Evergrande,"Marc Filippino

Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Tuesday, January 30th and this is your FT News Briefing.

Binance customers are looking for some security. And a major Chinese property developer is going under. Plus, Brazil's president is returning to an old and controversial playbook to get the economy back on track. I'm Marc Filippino and here's the news you need to start the day.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Binance will let some of its customers hold assets with a third party. The cryptocurrency exchange caved to pressure. Its larger customers want to keep holdings at independent banks. The head of a crypto trading firm told the FT that in theory, it's safer to park money in a bank because it has oversight from regulators. The move highlights just how uneasy traders have become about Binance. The US Department of Justice fined the exchange last year and its CEO pleaded guilty to federal crimes.

China's Evergrande is going to be liquidated. It opens a new and unpredictable phase for the world's most indebted property developer. Evergrande's official default two years ago triggered a cash crunch for other developers, and it's still hobbling the world's second-largest economy. I'm joined now by the FT's Shanghai correspondent Tom Hale. So, Tom, just give us the details. What exactly happened on Monday?

Thomas Hale

So a Hong Kong court has ruled that Evergrande, or at least its holding company in Hong Kong, should be liquidated. That comes after just over two years of negotiations with international creditors, which ultimately failed to find any kind of common ground with the company itself. The complication is the extent to which this order will involve the liquidation, not just of the Hong Kong entity of Evergrande but its hundreds of entities across the Chinese mainland that relate to its core homebuilding business.

Marc Filippino

So, Tom, how could that actually play out?

Thomas Hale

Yeah, well, according to the Evergrande operations in mainland China, this ruling is not going to affect what remains of their day-to-day business. But the complication is that the liquidation order in Hong Kong could potentially be submitted to three courts in mainland China. Those are courts in Shenzhen, Xiamen and Shanghai. And if it is accepted by those courts, then the company's entity in Hong Kong may have the capacity to make claims on assets in the Chinese mainland that could not only disrupt the proceedings of the business, but also pave the way for conflicts with mainland creditors who have enormous claims on Evergrande and have sat on those claims for several years now. But there are huge uncertainties right now as to what exactly the Evergrande entity in Hong Kong owns in relation to the many, you know, the hundreds if not thousands of Evergrande projects and project-level companies that exist across China.

Marc Filippino

Wow. So what could be the greater significance here for the Chinese economy?

Thomas Hale

The whole episode, at the very highest level, is a strong evidence that the property boom that sustained a lot of growth in China for several decades has reached a crucial turning point. And the information that comes out of the liquidation process, at least in Hong Kong, is potentially gonna provide more information about the exact nature of these projects that Evergrande has, the extent to which they are abandoned projects in ghost cities, or the extent to which the company's projects were less problematic than its management of its cash flows. So the process of discovery that's gonna take place through the liquidation order in Hong Kong is likely to provide much needed detail and nuance on what exactly has gone wrong with the Chinese property sector.

Marc Filippino

Now, if you're kind of following this from a long way away like I am, and you're not necessarily a creditor either in China or in Hong Kong, what's the real significance of Evergrande's bankruptcy ruling?

Thomas Hale

Well, I would say that for anyone with an international perspective on China, it's going to shed light on the way in which the Chinese legal system and the Chinese bankruptcy system interacts with international claims outside of the country, or truths about the direction in which the country is moving, whether it's becoming more or less open, which is a topic that's widely discussed in post-Covid China. It's also, as has been the case since the default of Evergrande in late 2021, it's going to be a test case of what happens when the kind of legal norms of international finance clash with the highly opaque world of Chinese property.

British businesses are really feeling the pinch from Brexit. The cost of trading with the European Union has soared since the UK left the bloc. A survey found that most UK-based businesses are less profitable as a result of Brexit. Businesses on average have spent nearly £100,000 over the past three years navigating new customs rules. The findings come as the UK government gets ready to phase in new Brexit border checks on most plant and animal products from the EU.

It's been about one year since Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva returned to office. And Lula, as he's called, has big plans to jump-start his country's economy. He's turning back to his old playbook, the one he used when he was in office from 2003 to 2010. And it's all about state capitalism. I'm joined now by Michael Pooler. He covers Brazil for the FT. Hi, Michael.

Michael Pooler

Hi, Marc.

Marc Filippino

So, Michael, tell me a little bit about Lula's playbook and the sort of economic conditions that he's operating in.

Michael Pooler

So Brazil just experienced what some economists call a lost decade. And by that they mean very low growth rates over this period, and living standards that are only where they were about 10 years ago. And so the country has really struggled to drag itself out of a prolonged period of mediocrity. Now, Lula's answer is to use the might of the state to spur growth and spread prosperity. So Lula has increased welfare payments for the poorest. His government has managed to loosen restrictions on the amount of public spending, and they've also laid out some really bold promises to improving infrastructure. This is to be delivered through a major public works program that aims to improve areas like water and sanitation, energy and transport infrastructure.

Marc Filippino

Now, like I mentioned, Michael, Lula's tried this kind of state capitalism model before. How did it play out when he was president from 2003 to 2010?

Michael Pooler

So Lula's first four-year term was viewed as rather fiscally orthodox. Then in his second term, the global financial crisis struck. And in order to counteract the effects of that downturn, he started spending more and there was greater stimulus. But critics say that this opened the door to what happened under his chosen successor, Dilma Rousseff. She was accused of overspending, of interfering in the economy and creating a fiscal imbalance. And the presidency of Dilma Rousseff was also tainted by the revelation of a huge political bribery scheme, which was uncovered by an investigation called Car Wash. And this showed that billions of dollars was sucked out of the state-controlled oil company Petrobras. And Lula himself was even sent to prison on corruption convictions that were later overturned.

Marc Filippino

Yeah, I remember that corruption scandal. It took down quite a few prominent politicians and really hit Lula's party. So how is this time gonna be any different, Michael?

Michael Pooler

So the government says that its big public works program will have greater private sector involvement compared to those that it run in the past. And one of the key focuses is attracting foreign capital for the green transition -- so things like carbon credits, renewable energy and electric car production. However, under previous infrastructure schemes that were launched by Lula's party while in government, a lot of projects went unfinished and there was a lot of criticisms of waste, incompetence. So that's led to a lot of concerns that we could see the mistakes of the past repeating.

Marc Filippino

OK, so then how would we define success for Lula this time around? I mean, what would need to happen in the economy in order for his plan to go smoothly?

Michael Pooler

So the big concern from mainstream economists and investors alike, and what they'll always tell you is about the fiscal question. And one of the big variables in Brazil's economy is the level of interest rates. Its central bank was at the forefront of global moves to jack up interest rates in the fight against inflation. And it has started cutting them. However, the base interest rate is still 11.75 per cent, which is very high. And that's weighing on economic activity. But the worry among a lot of economists and investors is that if there's any perception that public spending is getting out of control and there's fiscal imbalance, then it will make it a lot harder for the central bank to carry on cutting rates, because there could be a knock-on effect in inflation. For Lula's presidency to be judged a success, we'll need to see sustainable foundations laid for long-term growth that can reduce unemployment and create competitive industries in Brazil.

2024-01-30,China Evergrande liquidation to test Hong Kong's legal reach,"Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

When Hong Kong judge Linda Chan ordered China Evergrande into liquidation on Monday, she opened a critical new phase in the slow-motion collapse of the world's most indebted property developer -- and set up a high-profile test of the reach of the former British colony's courts.

How the winding up of the company's Hong Kong entity proceeds, and how much international investors can recover of the tens of billions of dollars they invested in Evergrande, will depend mainly on the attitude of authorities and courts across the border in mainland China.

Almost all of the company's homebuilding activity takes place in the Chinese mainland, where most of its more than $300bn in liabilities are also owed and a property slowdown has become one of the government's most pressing challenges.

Just over two years on from Evergrande's default, the liquidation ruling comes at a time of renewed international scrutiny of legal and political norms within mainland China, where foreign investment has slumped post-Covid pandemic. Beijing's priorities, including the completion of unfinished residential projects, could clash with those of creditors within and outside of the country.

""It definitely won't be straightforward to get money out of mainland China,"" said Nigel Trayers, a restructuring and insolvency specialist at Grant Thornton in Hong Kong. ""It's fairly clear that the priority is delivering properties that have been sold.""

The Hong Kong court's appointment of Eddie Middleton and Tiffany Wong, from the restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsal, as Evergrande's liquidators should at least provide new information about the developer. Throughout the Chinese property crisis sparked by Evergrande's default in late 2021, investors have struggled to get any detailed understanding of developers' woes.

""When you have Hong Kong liquidators in, under Hong Kong law you can require the board to give you the books and records,"" said one specialist in restructurings. ""You can take over the Evergrande Group's operations.""

Those operations are, however, far from straightforward. Like many other Chinese property groups that secured overseas funding, Evergrande is a sprawling collection of companies based onshore and offshore, with total assets of nearly Rmb1.7tn ($240bn) as of September last year. It also has individual project-level units across the mainland, where its main corporate entity is known as Hengda.

""You'd imagine a lot of these subsidiaries on the mainland have their own creditors and bank debt, so a lot of them could themselves be insolvent and not really able to deliver any value up the structure where the liquidators sit,"" Trayers said.

""Are they [the liquidators] going to get the facts on the projects that have value or equity? They will only get a real insight on what those are if the company co-operates.""

China Evergrande Group, the entity that is subject to the winding-up order, is a Hong Kong-based holding company that is one of the wider group's ""main offshore financing platforms"", according to court documents. Since listing in 2006, it has issued $132bn in equity, adding to more than $20bn in offshore bonds the company raised through various subsidiaries.

On five previous occasions, the world's most indebted developer had managed to delay a decision on whether it should be wound up, arguing that it needed more time to restructure the international debts on which it originally defaulted.

But this time, Judge Chan had run out of patience. ""There is no restructuring proposal,"" she wrote in her final comment. ""It seems to me that the interests of the creditors will be better protected if the Company is wound up by the court.""

The holding company has some assets in Hong Kong, such as an electric vehicle company and a property services company, that can now be taken over, although they also in turn hold assets in the mainland. The vast majority of the company's funds are believed to have flowed into real estate projects across the border, where 90 per cent of its assets are based and where liquidations require separate approval from a mainland court. Part of the task for the liquidators in Hong Kong is to establish the scale and nature of such cross-border exposure.

Hong Kong's legal system, which is based on English common law and has for decades smoothed the flow of capital into the mainland, differs markedly from China's socialist system of law, part of the country's political infrastructure where the Communist party has absolute authority.

A 2021 arrangement between Hong Kong and mainland China under which insolvency orders can be mutually recognised is one window of opportunity for creditors. But it requires Hong Kong liquidators to apply for approval to one of three pilot courts in Shanghai, Shenzhen or the south-east city of Xiamen.

""There may be situations where the mainland courts will refuse to recognise Hong Kong winding up orders,"" Hong Kong's Department of Justice said in November in response to a written query from the Financial Times on the arrangement. In 2021 a court in Shenzhen recognised a Hong Kong court-appointed liquidator's authority in the case of Samson Paper. But industry practitioners said there were few instances of successful applications.

""There have only been a couple of actual cases, and they were nothing like the size or scale or substance [of Evergrande],"" Trayers said.

If liquidation orders are granted in the mainland, the process of enforcing them would still require collaboration with other creditors, and equity claims of the kind widely associated with foreign inflows would rank below domestic loans. Enforcement could also be difficult given the fraught political backdrop, which has seen domestic investors in property protest over losses.

In nearby Guangzhou, where Evergrande has relocated its headquarters from Shenzhen and which is not part of any mutual recognition pilot scheme, the company's building was this month surrounded by police and newly erected fencing.

Hui Ka Yan, Evergrande's founder and formerly China's richest man, was placed under ""mandatory measures"" in September for suspicion of unspecified crimes.

Speaking outside court on Monday, Wong, the liquidator, said she wanted ""to see as much of the business as possible retained, restructured or remain operational"".

Shawn Siu, interim chief executive of Hengda, responded to the liquidation order on Monday by emphasising that the subject was listed in Hong Kong and that the domestic subsidiaries remained independent, raising uncertainty over what assets creditors could seize.

Evergrande will continue to build homes, he said. ""The Group will still strive to do everything possible to ensure the stability of domestic business and operations.""",Hong Kong judge Linda Chan has ordered China Evergrande into liquidation.

2024-01-30,Brazil's imports of Russian oil products soar,"Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

Brazilian imports of diesel from Russia last year soared 4,600 per cent while purchases of fuel oil rose by almost 400 per cent, in a $8.6bn boost to the Russian economy as the war in Ukraine enters its third year.

Brasília imported 6.1mn tonnes of diesel from Russia in 2023, a 6,000 per cent increase from the 101,000 tonnes the previous year. The value in dollar terms increased 4,600 per cent from $95mn to $4.5bn, according to official government figures.

The Latin American nation also increased its purchases of fuel oil from Russia, with imports growing to $5.3bn last year from $1.1bn the previous year.

Brazil overtook Turkey in October to become the largest buyer of Russian diesel, according to data from Kpler, while the jump in diesel imports last year means Russia has overtaken the US as Brazil's largest supplier of the fuel.

Government officials say the sharp increase in purchases -- which occurred during leftwing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's first year back in office -- helped to control prices for the consumer.

Asked about the jump in Russian diesel imports, Brazil's development, industry and foreign trade ministry said foreign trade was ""influenced by multiple factors"" and that ""fuel imports are the result of decisions made by private agents and follow the logic of supply and demand"".

Moscow has been selling crude oil and oil products at discounted rates due to sanctions placed on it by western nations as a result of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The purchases by Brazil are allowed under the sanctions regime as long as it complies with a detailed set of regulations on issues such as shipping.

Oliver Stuenkel, professor of international relations at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, said: ""The first thing going on is just realpolitik. Brazil has identified an opportunity to obtain Russian commodities at a discount and it is not only diesel, but also fertiliser. The same goes for countries like India.

""[But] at the same time Brazil is keen to preserve its economic and political ties with Russia. Brazil being willing to help out in the midst of this situation [in Ukraine] is part of an implicit dynamic within the Brics, which is they have an all-weather friendship and help each other out in times of difficulty,"" he said, referring to the group that also includes Russia, India, China and South Africa.

The minister of mines and energy last year said the ministry ""works tirelessly to guarantee the supply of fuel . . . for the country"".

The dramatic rise in imports may fuel accusations that Brazil is sympathetic to Russia in the war.

Although Brasília officially condemned Russia's invasion, Lula last year repeatedly claimed that Kyiv bears equal responsibility with Moscow for the conflict and has accused Washington of ""encouraging"" the violence.

After the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin, accusing him of war crimes in Ukraine, Lula said the Russian leader would be welcome to attend the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro this year without the fear of detention. He later backtracked and said it would be an issue for the courts to decide.

In December, Russia accounted for 85 per cent of Brazil's total diesel imports; the average for 2023 was about 50 per cent.

A top-10 crude producing nation, Brazil relies on diesel imports to fill about 20 per cent of domestic demand. Under Lula, its state-controlled oil major Petrobras is investing to boost refinery capacity.

Felipe Perez, Americas director at S&P Global Commodity Insights, said that, while there might be ""some politics"" at play, price was the crucial factor driving the diesel imports.

""People will try to find the cheapest diesel. Everything in Brazil depends on diesel. It is not just transport, but the agribusiness sector too,"" he said.

The price of diesel has long been a sensitive issue in Brazil, which depends on legions of truckers to keep the economy moving. More than 60 per cent of cargo in the continent-sized nation is transported by truck, compared with 32 per cent in the US.","Brazilian imports of diesel from Russia soared 4,600 per cent last year.

2024-01-29,Could a dance coach boost your career performance?,"Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

Movement director Pat Boguslawski stole the show at Paris Haute Couture Fashion Week with his choreography for Maison Margiela's spring 2024 show. Here we republish our 2020 article in which he discusses his work for the fashion house

Joaquin Phoenix used one to prepare for Joker. The senior team at JP Morgan has several on staff, as does the FBI. John Galliano and Marc Jacobs use them to create global fashion moments. The movement director comes in a variety of guises, including choreographer and coach (or even fashion designer if you're Saul Nash, the young movement coach who radically choreographed his autumn/winter 2020 fashion show for Fashion East last month), but all are employed to finesse our lives, whether that be in preparation for a role or to help project the values of a brand. Increasingly, they're also being used to hone poise at a more personal level, training people how to connect with an audience, TED-talk style; how to establish trust around the table; how to run, dance and even date. From power moves to happy moves, we could all do with a bit of movement direction, it seems.

It's not always easy to stand out at fashion week, especially when you're a male model in a female-led show. But Leon Dame has become a sensation in recent seasons owing to the extraordinary moves he brings to Maison Margiela's shows. Spring/summer 2020 found him strutting in stilettos, lunging at startled members of the front row. In January, he brought an equally compelling extravagance and broody glamour to the house's haute couture.

Dame worked with Pat Boguslawski, a former dancer who started as a movement director while modelling for designer Sarah Burton at Alexander McQueen. ""Sarah said the way I moved expressed the mood of her collection. She asked me to teach the other models."" At Margiela, with Dame, he's found a perfect muse. ""John [Galliano]'s clothes had a really strong look,"" he says. ""I wanted Leon's walk to be just as powerful."" Today, everybody wants a piece of Boguslawski. It's unsurprising. The fashion campaigns he works on are magnetic: Rita Ora sunny and sexy for Escada; Kendall Jenner cartwheeling for Longchamp; Winnie Harlow and Hailey Baldwin crackling with sass as Tommy Hilfiger Icons. He's worked with Vogue, with Victoria Beckham, and on numerous fashion shoots. ""A lot of people don't know what to do in front of a camera. I help them,"" he says.

On film sets, movement directors are increasingly vaulting on from choreographing dance scenes to working with actors to create their characters. For his Oscar-winning performance in Joker, Joaquin Phoenix worked with movement coach Michael Arnold to develop the role's physicality - originally there was to be far less movement, then they started watching videos of dancers and the expression of a whole new dimension to the character emerged. Similarly, when Polly Bennett worked with Rami Malek to shape the role of Safin, the villain in the coming Bond film No Time To Die, they studied the movements of a host of baddies to understand ""what it is that makes them villainous"" and then, through physicality, ""how do we create a new villain?"". The two had worked together on Bohemian Rhapsody, with Bennett spending hours decoding Freddie Mercury's showmanship to help Malek step into the role. ""Your body is made up of the things you've done in your life. I look for clues,"" she says. She unpacked, for example, the fact that Mercury played golf and that the dramatic swing of his half mic was related to that of a driving iron.

It's a similar deal with Elvis, whose physical expression Bennett is currently mining for the Baz Luhrmann musical biopic that stars Tom Hanks and Austin Butler. ""To understand all the things he does on stage, we looked at how he was brought up, who he was around,"" she says. Or with the Queen, whom Bennett studied to help Olivia Colman on The Crown. ""Part of being the Queen is there's always someone to guide you. So you never need to turn your head."" Off-screen, Bennett also helps executives embody their brand and message when communicating to an audience. Often, she says, a client will have a brilliant mind but their physicality lets them down: ""There's a lot of self-criticism and it holds you back. We all have physical tells that give us away. I break clients free of them.""

Much investment has been placed on how to carry yourself in a public arena. Caroline Goyder - a voice specialist who charges up to £1,000 for one-on-one hourly coaching sessions, whose TED talk on overcoming stage paralysis has had 7.5 million views, and who recently published the book Finding Your Voice: Secrets To Speaking With Confidence - says movement should be central to your preparation. ""The heads of corporates often ask me the same thing: how to do a TED-style talk. They know they need to come across as conversational but have no idea how. To appear natural, you need to inhabit a feeling of ease. The audience will read your body at an unconscious level. If you relax, they relax - and they will start to trust what you are saying. The problem, of course, is that you dash to your event juggling calls from four continents; you're holding your breath tight in your chest; your nervous system is locked in flight or fight."" To shortcut yourself out of adrenaline mode, ""movement is really useful. The body responds more readily than the brain, so you can send the brain positive calming signals by taking 10 minutes to do yoga, or even just to shake out your limbs, roll out your shoulders, and - most important - breathe deeply.""

Joe Navarro is a former FBI agent. These days, the bestselling author of What Every BODY Is Saying has regular gigs from multinational financial organisations to Harvard Business School, where he teaches body language in the boardroom. Female executives often gain a huge amount from his direction, he says, especially when it comes to ""owning their space. 'Command presence' is something they teach in the British and the American military - how you hold yourself, how you move. It gives you an edge."" He recalls working with JP Morgan asset and wealth management CEO Mary Erdoes: ""She has a wonderful commanding presence: in her poise, in the way she walks into a room. She exerts influence.""

That said, the days of the stronger handshake or a gusset-wrenching power-stance are over. Today, ""command presence is an attitude of confidence: the confidence to make broad, smooth, wide gestures; to stand without fidgeting; to hold your body upright; and make eye contact,"" says Navarro. The name of the game is building relationships. Navarro talks in terms of fostering harmony or synchronisation - ""If you lean back and relax, it behoves me to do the same,"" he says. ""If I am leaning forward, we are out of sync."" It's the same with speech: ""Are they a fast or slow talker? Should I slow down my conversation?""

""Pause to register your movements and those of the other person,"" advises Anne-Maartje Oud, founder of The Behaviour Company. ""Ask yourself, can I change the tenor of this interaction by adjusting something physical - is the way I'm standing signifying dominance? Would my being further away or sitting down give them comfort and lead to a more productive conversation?"" This kind of deportment advice works with employees. It's also great with children. And romantic partners. At matchmaking agency Drawing Down The Moon, dating coaches advise clients never to sit opposite one another on a first date. ""It feels confrontational, like an interview, which is absolutely not what you want,"" says CEO Gillian McCallum. ""If you can, go for a walk, shoulder to shoulder. Moving together builds a sense of rapport, a dynamic connection.""

This notion is put to good effect in the cult Channel 4 programme Flirty Dancing. In each episode, the leader of Diversity dance troupe Ashley Banjo choreographs a dance for two singletons. They meet in silence, dance and part, later choosing whether to go on a date. Banjo's routines are designed to build physical rapport before the partners speak. It's a potent, feelgood blind date that, at times, can be quite erotic. Last year, a pairing of two men dancing to Paloma Faith's Lullaby went viral: their faces and bodies lit with excitement, nerves, attraction - the energy leaping between them.

Legendary choreographer Twyla Tharp recommends that everyone keep some power music for moments of need. ""On days when you need all the help you can get, nothing promotes the victory rush like [certain pieces of] music,"" she writes in her new book, Keep It Moving. ""As we get older our bodies enjoy less freedom of movement, we tend to take up less space."" Fight it. ""Dancers are taught to move so that every gesture is not only more precise and elegant but bigger. We call it amplitude."" Expansive movement, she holds, fosters expansive thinking.

Even something as straightforward as lengthening our stride brings benefits. ""As we spend time sitting down or staring at a phone, our posture changes,"" says Mike Antonaides, founder of the Running and Movement School in London. ""Everyone who comes here has to relearn how to walk. We re-educate the neural pathways in the brain that activate your muscles, returning people to the natural movement pattern they had as children, including longer stride length with arms swinging cross-laterally [left arm with right foot]."" Sound simple? Absolutely. But it works.

At its heart, movement direction is about how you best use your body; about moving with intention and grace. At times the focus might be embodying the rock-godliness of Elvis or the cool attitude of Margiela. It might be about connecting with your staff or your audience; often it's about connecting with yourself. ""If I work with a movie star or politician or on a hip-hop commercial, I feed in the same information,"" says Bennett. ""Movement unites us on a profound level."" The basics are simple. Breathe deeply. Move with focus and (appropriate) amplitude. ""By my definition, to move is to dance,"" says Tharp. ""Choose to make your life bigger. Shut up and dance.""","Movement director Pat Boguslawski has choreographed Maison Margiela's spring 2024 show. The former FBI agent has worked with John Galliano and Marc Jacobs.

2024-01-29,What's ticking at LVMH Watch Week?,"Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

This year, Miami hosts LVMH Watch Week, the event that gives us the first hint of what to expect from the horological year ahead. To judge from the conversations I had with the bosses of the brands (Hublot, Bulgari, TAG Heuer, Zenith, Genta and Roth), 2024 looks like being a time of ""consolidation"" - which I take as executive speak for caution in the face of what is set to be a challenging year ahead.

All change at the top table

Indeed, the biggest announcement comes not from the watchmaker's bench but the boardroom table. Frédéric Arnault, LVMH scion and quondam CEO of TAG Heuer, has been upgraded to a new role: CEO of the LVMH watch division. This has initiated a game of executive musical chairs that has seen the energetic and dynamic Julien Tornare move across to head up TAG, creating a vacancy at Zenith, which has been filled by Benoit de Clerck, formerly of Panerai. Add the fact that LVMHWW 2024 welcomes Jean Arnault (Frédéric's younger brother) from Louis Vuitton's La Fabrique du Temps, who will be presenting watches from prestige reboots Gérald Genta and Daniel Roth, and there is plenty to mull before looking at a single watch.

Hublot continues to break the mould

Hublot, of course, continues to be led by Ricardo Guadalupe, who believes that he has the highlight of the event with the MP-10. Short for Masterpiece, the MP series has included some of the wildest watchmaking of recent years - and the MP-10 Tourbillon Weight Energy System Titanium is certainly that.

The watch owes an aesthetic debt to the MP-05; the time is read vertically on constantly rotating drums in the centre, while the vertical self-winding system relies on a pair of sliding white-gold weights that flank the movement and time display. The case design defies concise description and needs to be seen. It is entirely coherent with Hublot's rebellious streak and its focus on contemporary art and design: there is a new Orlinski watch, a Daniel Arsham collab is coming up this year, and Samuel Ross is designing the public spaces of the new Hublot Manufacture building.

Any colour, as long as it's green

The extension of the colour palette for Saxem (Hublot's sapphire crystal-like material) to include a lime-coloured Big Bang is on trend, with green watches also being presented by TAG, Bulgari and Zenith, which offers a pine-green dial on its popular Zenith Chronomaster sport.

A similar shade is also an option on a returning Zenith classic, the Triple calendar chronograph with moonphase, which is a most welcome, long overdue reintroduction to the main collection and packs a lot of watch into a sensible 38mm case based on the shape and proportions of the 1969 original.

The Bulgari Bulgari is back

Bulgari is also taking a stroll down memory lane with the reappearance of what for many people is the emblematic timepiece by the Roman jeweller: the Bulgari Bulgari, which appears in a dinky 26mm case and a soi-disant ""gender-neutral"" 38mm. Launched in 1975, its bezel was originally engraved Bulgari Roma with a liquid crystal display and hemp cord strap, which I wouldn't mind seeing revived (the hemp cord strap, not the LCD).

The ubiquitous Serpenti is being given a bit of a well-deserved rest this LVMH Watch Week, allowing attention to fall on the ladies' collection Lucea which celebrates its 10th anniversary with - yes, you guessed it - a touch of green; in this instance the introduction of a malachite mosaic dial, made from the shards of the decorative stone that are usually discarded.

TAG Heuer connects with its past

At TAG Heuer they're turning the dial on the time machine two years further back to 1968 and the Carrera Dato, which shifted the date window from three o'clock to nine o'clock.

The return of the Dato, using the box glass that was such a hit on last year's designs for the 60th anniversary of Carrera, will be something for vintage enthusiasts to pore over - and the use of what the brand calls teal green is certainly eye-catching. There is also a teal dial option on the range-topping Carrera Chronograph Tourbillon. And if you have a TAG Heuer Connected watch, you will be able to download the teal and other dials. There are also additions to the Aquaracer and Carrera Plasma lines.

Roth and Genta roll back the clock

The elite watchmaking brands Roth and Genta play to their strengths as well. The former is showing an exquisite homage to the revived brand's 1988 masterpiece, the Tourbillon Souscription in the double ellipse case.

The latter presents the Mickey Mouse minute repeater that unites a hattrick of the master's horological signatures: octagonal case, minute repeater and Disney dial. It was to have been auctioned at Only Watch - now postponed sine die - but Only Watch's loss is very much LVMH Watch Week's gain. So, if you are a Genta fan you have the perfect reason to make a trip to Miami... well, that and the sun.","Frédéric Arnault, LVMH's scion and quondam CEO of TAG Heuer, has been upgraded to a new role: CEO of the watch division.

2024-01-29,Hungary vows to defy EU 'blackmail' over Ukraine funding,"Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

Hungary has vowed to defy EU pressure to approve a four-year, €50bn aid package to Ukraine, condemning as ""blackmail"" a proposal to undermine its economy if it fails to back down.

Brussels has laid out ways to sabotage Hungary's economy unless it agrees to drop its veto against the Ukraine funding plan at a special summit this week, in a confidential document seen by the Financial Times.

Hungary's currency fell 0.7 per cent to Ft389 per euro and the benchmark 10-year bond yield rose 0.09 percentage points to 6.35 per cent, the highest level since December, in early Monday trading.

""Hungary does not give in to blackmail,"" Hungary's EU minister János Bóka wrote on X on Sunday night. ""The document, drafted by Brussels bureaucrats, only confirms what the Hungarian Government has been saying for a long time: access to EU funds is used for political blackmailing.""

EU leaders will gather on Thursday to discuss a plan to use the bloc's budget to provide Ukraine with crucial financial assistance necessary to continue its war effort against Russia's full-scale invasion.

The emergency summit was called because Hungarian leader Viktor Orbán vetoed the package at a December summit. With US aid also held up in Congress, Ukraine's finances are in a perilous state and it urgently needs the EU infusion.

The Brussels proposal sets out ways to exploit Hungary's economic weaknesses, noting its high inflation and high cost of debt. The plan would rely on other EU leaders pledging to freeze all EU funding to Budapest in the event of Orbán's veto, sparking a possible fall in investor confidence in the country.

Two EU diplomats told the FT that they were not convinced all other EU leaders would agree to do so. However, they said the proposal underscored the depth of anger at Orbán's refusal to assist Ukraine, an EU candidate country, and the nadir of the Brussels-Budapest relationship.

Alongside the Ukraine funding stand-off, Hungary is also under intense pressure from its western allies in Nato to approve Sweden's accession to the alliance. Budapest is the last member still blocking that process, despite promises to the contrary.

Last week the US accused Orbán of pursuing a ""fantasy foreign policy"" on the issues, saying Hungary was acting in the interests of Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

Orbán has repeatedly said he will not agree to amending the bloc's common budget to allow for more aid to Ukraine, nor will he permit any more joint borrowing to raise the necessary funds.

Instead, he demanded member states finance a separate fund without new borrowing. The other 26 member states have resisted that idea.

Yet in an emergency proposal on Saturday, Budapest appeared to have softened its position, telling the FT it would accept modifying the EU budget and even joint new debt as long as it retained a right to review the package each year and block it if necessary.

However, that idea has already been declared unacceptable by other member states.

""Brussels is using blackmail against Hungary like there's no tomorrow, despite the fact that we have proposed a compromise,"" Balázs Orbán, the premier's political director, wrote on X.

He added that the EU's complaints about democratic backsliding in Hungary, and a resulting freeze on tens of billions of euros' worth of funds, were being used to apply political pressure to force Budapest to comply with the bloc's Ukraine policies.

""Now it's crystal clear: this . . . has nothing to do with the rule of law. And now they're not even trying to hide it,"" Balázs Orbán said. ""Whatever happens, change is needed in Brussels!""

Hungary's foreign minister visited the western Ukrainian region of Zakarpattia on Monday to discuss bilateral ties with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba and Andriy Yermak, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's chief of staff. The goal was, partly, to prepare a meeting between Viktor Orbán and Zelenskyy.

""For a better relationship, a frank dialogue is needed,"" Yermak posted on Twitter. ""We are ready.""","Hungary vows to defy EU pressure to approve a four-year, €50bn aid package to Ukraine.

2024-01-29,Five gadgets with great lenses,"Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

Putting advanced tech into traditional-looking hardware is guaranteed to initiate mild euphoria in people of a certain age - my age, in fact, if we're going to be specific about this. Nikon's latest Z-mount mirrorless camera presents as an old-school F-mount: pseudo-leatherette exterior, buttons and switches inspired by 50-year-old models but given modern functionality, brass dials destined to take on a gentle patina over time, a ker-chunk mechanical shutter. The classic black version is unashamedly retro, but for those who yearn for a more flamboyant collision of classic and modern, it comes in six more colourways including Moss Green and Sunset Orange.

A camera that takes its design cues from the past will inevitably suffer an ergonomic hit; while it's substantially lighter than its professional big sisters the Z8 and Z9, the Z f is not necessarily more comfortable in the hand. But that's a minor negative in a sea of positives. For those (like myself) who experience low-level unease when manually adjusting camera settings, full auto mode does some spectacular heavy lifting and essentially plonks a supercharged compact camera in your hand: very quick start-up time plus brilliant results. If you already speak fluent ISO/aperture/shutter speed, you can assume as much control as you like. But if you want to learn, the Z f acquaints you with the basics and encourages you to think creatively about the images you're making.

It's a well-forged alliance of new and old. On one hand, you've got slots for both SD and microSD cards, a vari-angle monitor for vloggers, super-smooth slo-mo video and automatic subject detection (people, animals, aircraft...) On the other, it has a deep-tone monochrome mode that's capable of stunning black-and-white pictures with barely any effort - the kind of bold shots you'd have worked hard with a red filter to achieve back in the days of film. If you grew up using such cameras, the Z f will prompt a gentle smile of recognition. If you didn't, you'll simply be enjoying semi-pro power in a quite beautiful package. Nikon Z f, from £2,299 body-only

Instant gratification

Polaroid's journey has been extraordinary, from hugely celebrated (both practically and artistically) to almost obsolete and back again. It's faintly preposterous that this new, high-end, three-lens, autofocusing integral film camera even exists, given how easy it is to snap high-quality pictures on our far more portable smartphones. But as soon as you slot in a chunky cartridge of i-type film, those eight shots become rather precious.

The device works seamlessly with the accompanying app (I hardly ever say that) and the resulting pictures are now pinned to my office noticeboard: shimmering colour, sharp detail and a beautiful bokeh blur. Polaroid I-2 Instant Camera, £599.99

A level head

Having experienced the indignity of trying to assemble and align an errant smartphone gimbal in public, I'm thankful for DJI's compact, all-in-one camera-gimbal flagship, which makes such antics look laughably old-fashioned. This package comes with two handles, mic transmitter, wide-angle lens, tripod and other goodies. Three gimbal modes offer flexibility when filming (eg, Follow mode for selfies) and its Active Track feature will doggedly follow whichever subject is in focus. The 2in touchscreen is adequate enough for monitoring, but the true majesty is revealed when playing back on a big screen: smooth 4K footage with vibrant colours. DJI Osmo Pocket 3 Creator Combo, £619

Reach for the stars

Amateur astronomy can involve a steep learning curve. There's plenty of tech out there for urban stargazers, but you have to know where to look, when to look and what for. Unistellar's newest model is designed for those with little knowledge but boundless curiosity; the companion app advises where the most interesting stellar objects currently are and what they're up to on a given night, while high-precision Nikon optics guide you towards them. Multi-depth technology captures low brightness objects (nebulae and galaxies) as well as high (the moon, planets), and does a great job of autofocusing on these small dots despite the expanse of darkness surrounding them. Unistellar Odyssey Pro, from £3,499

Your next project

Large, high-spec TVs come with two annoyances: getting them up a spiral staircase and reflections on the screen. Both these are resolved by short-throw projecting onto an ALR (ambient light rejecting) screen, and the Cine 1 demonstrates this to wonderful effect. It's Leica's tardy follow-up to the world's first mass-produced projector (the Uleja) launched in 1926. That device is now a museum piece, but the Cine 1 is a true living-room statement, a sizeable 15kg unit with 50W Dolby Atmos surround sound. While cheaper short-throws can project at different sizes but suffer an attendant dip in visual quality, the 120in version of the Cine 1 projects at 120in alone, but in breathtaking detail.

2024-01-29,Transcript: The challenges to a ceasefire in Gaza,"Joanna Kao

Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Monday, January 29th and this is your FT News Briefing.

The White House says that Iran-backed militants killed three US service members yesterday. And diplomats from all over the world are working on plans to halt the fighting in Gaza. Plus, carmakers in Germany are under a lot of pressure to adapt to electric vehicles.

Patricia Nilsson

For decades, the German car was the pinnacle of engineering. I mean, that's what the Germans were famous for. And the heart of the car was the engine.

Joanna Kao

I'm Joanna Kao, in for Marc Filippino. And here's the news you need to start your day.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

The White House announced on Sunday that three US service members were killed by a drone attack on a military base near the border of Syria and Jordan. American officials say the attack was carried out by Iran-backed militant groups. The deaths are the first US casualties in the Middle East since the Israel-Hamas war began in Gaza, and President Biden has promised to hold those responsible to account. Fears are growing that the US and its allies could be drawn into a wider regional war.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Staying on the conflict in the Middle East, the United Nations' highest court on Friday ordered Israel to limit harm to Palestinians in Gaza. This was an initial ruling in a case brought by South Africa that accuses Israel of committing genocide. Israel has forcefully denied those accusations. The final ruling could take years, but it comes as leaders and diplomats are racing to put forward plans for a ceasefire. I'm joined now by the FT's Jerusalem correspondent, James Shotter. Hi, James.

James Shotter

Hi.

Joanna Kao

OK, so let's start with the ruling from the International Court of Justice. In what ways, if any, does this initial decision change the situation on the ground inside Gaza?

James Shotter

I think the answer, to be honest, is not very much. The court issued six emergency orders that Israel has to comply with. These included: you prevent and punish incitement to genocide, but allow the provision of more humanitarian aid in Gaza, then take steps to preserve evidence relating to the case. So from a military point of view, I don't think any of those orders is really gonna change the situation on the ground very much. I mean, South Africa in its application had asked for Israel to be ordered to immediately suspend its operation in Gaza. And the court didn't do that. So I think if it does have an impact, it's likely to be quite small.

Joanna Kao

Does the ruling potentially create a sort of breakpoint, or a means from which the international community can push for a more lasting ceasefire?

James Shotter

I mean, maybe it, you know, adds a little bit to the mounting international pressure on Israel to agree to a ceasefire. I think there's also a recognition that some of the other orders are at least politically uncomfortable for Israel. The order to punish and prevent incitements genocide, and the order that Israel has to provide a report to the ICJ on how it's complying with the measures the court has imposed -- both of those could affect the political debate a little bit in Israel and internationally, and also put Israel in a position of having to sort of explain itself on an ongoing basis, which I think, you know, is, I mean, it's obviously not a hugely significant impact, but it's less comfortable than it could have been.

Joanna Kao

So let's talk a little bit about where we stand in an effort to work towards a ceasefire. We've talked on the show before about a plan that Arab countries are working on. It would include the creation of a Palestinian state and the normalisation of diplomatic ties between Israel and its Arab neighbours, most importantly Saudi Arabia. Is it the only plan or are there others also under consideration?

James Shotter

Yeah, I mean, there's lots of initiatives being discussed by diplomats at the moment. I mean, as you say, there's the Arab plan. The EU is pushing for concrete steps towards a two-state solution, which is, as you know, its long-standing position. The UK also has its own, plan, which it's been discussing with other partners that would include temporary ceasefire and an exchange of hostages, and then work towards a permanent ceasefire and some sort of political horizon for a Palestinian state. And then, obviously, the US has been pushing for a two-state solution with the West Bank and Gaza. So I think, you know, there's a lot of plans being discussed at the moment, but the the road that they all face is that Benjamin Netanyahu, who's Israel's prime minister, he's spent his whole career trying to prevent the creation of a Palestinian state. And at the moment, certainly there's not much political appetite in Israel for a two-state solution. I mean, only really on the very left of the political spectrum is there much support for that. So even if Netanyahu were replaced, it doesn't necessarily mean that the Israeli leadership would be much more amenable to a two-state solution.

Joanna Kao

OK, so all these plans you bring up, they're all hinged in some way on a two-state solution. But like you say, that's kind of a non-starter for Israel at this point. So is there a road map for any sort of lasting ceasefire?

James Shotter

I think it's very difficult at the moment to see how we get to that just because the two sides are so entrenched. It's still hard to see how a deal can be reached, you know, at least in the short term. Maybe in the long term with enough external pressure, something is possible, but the politics is incredibly fraught.

Hungary's economy might take a serious hit if its leader blocks funding for Ukraine at a European Union summit later this week. The €50bn aid package for Ukraine has support from all other EU member states. But Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has promised to veto the proposal. In response, Brussels has drafted a strategy to shut down all EU funding to Budapest. The goal is to reduce investor confidence in Hungary's markets and hurt their currency. And the plan seems to have support from other EU members. This stand-off marks a significant escalation in tensions between the EU and Hungary.

Germany's car industry is one of the biggest in Europe, but it's had a few brutal years recently and now the industry is shrinking. Here to talk about some of the headwinds German car companies are facing is the FT's Frankfurt correspondent, Patricia Nilsson. Hey, Patricia.

Patricia Nilsson

Hello.

Joanna Kao

OK, so paint the picture for me. What sort of pressure is Germany's car industry bumping up against these days?

Patricia Nilsson

Well, one of the issues is that fewer cars are being sold in Europe overall. Look at a company like Volkswagen, which is the, you know, second-largest carmaker in the world. In 2019, so before the pandemic, they sold about 11mn cars globally. Last year they sold just over 9mn cars. That's a pretty big drop. And that's an issue to suppliers who rely on volume. But there's another thing happening at the same time, which is this transition towards electric vehicles. And for suppliers, that means they basically have to start making and selling new parts. It's very expensive to invest in this kind of research and development. And there's an additional issue, which is that it appears we just don't need as many people to make an electric car as the car with the combustion engine. And you're seeing that among suppliers now. Quite a lot of them are shedding jobs.

Joanna Kao

So you have a few headwinds there. But a big one seems to be the transition to EVs. What's making it particularly difficult for German companies?

Patricia Nilsson

For decades, the German car was the pinnacle of engineering. I mean, that's what the Germans were famous for. And the heart of the car was the engine. What's happening now is not just the transition to a new type of electric motor. Cars these days are more sold on their software capabilities, and building software is something that Germany has not really caught up with. I mean, it's not their strength. And so you're seeing that there is this race to sort of become better at building software and systems and so on. In the meantime, what's happening is you're seeing this rise of the Chinese carmaker.

Joanna Kao

Yeah. So tell me about the competition here. How is China nipping at Germany's heels in the car industry?

Patricia Nilsson

The world's biggest market for cars is China. And the German carmakers, especially Volkswagen, have a long history of being very strong in this market. What's happening now is that you're seeing all these Chinese start-ups that are starting to sell a lot of cars, but also they're selling only electric vehicles. That's their speciality. So, for example, a lot of these suppliers are in semiconductors or batteries or software. These are also businesses that have higher margins than the sort of traditional suppliers. And the German suppliers are still in many ways playing catch-up.

Joanna Kao

Do you think the German car industry can turn this around? And you know, what happens if they can't?

Patricia Nilsson

The German car industry is hugely important for Germany in terms of jobs, in terms of tax and its sort of reliance on exports. Needless to say, it could have nearly catastrophic consequences if the country would lose its car industry. I'm not saying it will. You've seen BMW and Mercedes-Benz, for example. They're trying to become more and more premium carmakers. So there it's less about volume and it's more about boosting margins on the cars they're actually selling. But for a company like Volkswagen, these are definitely scary times, as we are expecting Chinese carmakers to come in and start selling cheaper EV cars in Europe. And we'll have to see how that develops in the next couple of years. And of course, if these companies can develop models that really appeal to people.

Before we go, more employers are putting their foot down over work-from-home policies. In an effort to get people back at their desks, EY has started keeping track of every time someone swipes a key at their UK office door. Other companies are trying different tactics. Bank of America has sent what it calls letters of education to employees who haven't been showing up in person. And Citigroup has told its staff that it will be keeping an eye on attendance more closely. In the battle between work from home and return to office, it looks like return to office wins this round.

2024-01-29,UK looks increasingly isolated in its anti-crypto ETF stance,"Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools

The UK is becoming increasingly isolated as one of the few major global markets to continue to hold back from approving retail access to cryptocurrency exchange traded products.

Continental Europe has them, as do Australia, Brazil and Canada. The US has followed suit most recently with spot bitcoin ETFs, prompting Hong Kong to say it will also jump on board.

Yet the UK will not even let small investors buy those listed elsewhere even though Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has championed the UK as a crypto hub and has advocated for a regulatory framework that allows the sector to flourish in Britain.

The high-profile launch of 10 spot bitcoin ETFs on Wall Street earlier this month, some managed by household names such as BlackRock, Invesco and Fidelity, has heightened the UK's divergence from most other financial hubs.

The UK's stance was defined by a ruling in 2021, when its regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, banned the sale of cryptocurrency-related ""derivatives"" -- including exchange traded products -- to UK retail investors.

The FCA's ban appeared to be largely motivated by the emergence of leveraged products such as contracts for difference, with some operators offering as much as 100 times leverage on bitcoin, itself a highly volatile token. However, it also swept up unleveraged products such as plain vanilla ETPs and futures.

Some industry figures disagree with where the FCA has chosen to draw the line. It did not intervene, for example, in the trading by retail investors of digital tokens directly via crypto exchanges.

UK retail investors ""can invest in crypto, just not through the regulated products"", said Bradley Duke, chief strategist of London-based ETC Group. Its $1bn Physical Bitcoin exchange traded commodity is listed on Euronext Amsterdam and Paris, Frankfurt's Xetra exchange, the SIX Swiss Exchange and Chicago's CBOE, but cannot be on the London stock exchange because of the retail ban. In aggregate, continental Europe boasts 120 crypto ETPs with €8.4bn of assets, according to TrackInsight.

""A UK retail investor can't invest in a product like ours, a Mifid II [EU regulated] instrument, listed on a regulated exchange and sold through a regulated broker, who would screen you for applicability, depending on your investment objectives and profile,"" Duke said.

""But they can go to a crypto exchange and buy bitcoin without going through any checks and balances, and to me that doesn't really make sense.""

Andrew Prosser, head of investments at InvestEngine, a London-based investment platform whose 34,000 clients hold £320mn across almost 600 ETFs, said UK retail investors had two options if they want crypto exposure.

""They can either buy the coins themselves from digital exchanges. That comes with several problems: the need for digital wallets, private keys, the risk of theft. Or they can buy the shares of companies that track crypto, such as exchanges or miners,"" Prosser said.

He said there were lots of requests on InvestEngine's community forum for ETPs investing directly in crypto. ""So there is demand for it,"" he said.

Hector McNeil, co-founder and co-chief executive of London-based HANetf, which lists six ETC Group cryptocurrency vehicles on its ETF platform, said it was ""getting a lot more calls from advisers and discretionary fund managers"", about crypto since this month's flurry of US launches.

McNeil said that the recent launches in the US with managers such as BlackRock and Invesco getting involved, meant the asset class was now mainstream. ""I think the FCA will have to reassess their position,"" he said.

However, he did not believe the regulator should completely open the floodgates to all of the UK's estimated 9mn self-directed investors.

""I don't agree with general access,"" he said, adding that with any more complex product there should be ""some sort of gating"".

""If it's somebody like me putting 3 per cent of their portfolio in, that should be fine. If it's my mother wanting to put 100 per cent in because her friend down the social club told her she made loads of money, then I don't think that's right,"" McNeil added.

But he also said crypto ETPs were ""no more complex"" than inverse or leveraged products, where ""there is a procedure for brokers to give access"" to investors who pass a suitability test and have an adequate balance sheet.

""You can't tell me it's more risky that trading 30 times leverage on a CFD [contract for difference] or spread bet,"" McNeil added.

All the UK regulator had done, he said, is to ""push people to dodgy crypto exchanges. I don't think they have achieved what they wanted to achieve.""

Small investors ""are going through unregulated or under-regulated exchanges where there is no broker involved and there is no one looking out for the suitability of their investments"", said Duke. ""They have to hold the cryptocurrency themselves, which is risky.""

Despite these arguments, Prosser is not convinced the FCA, which declined to comment for this story, will buckle. When the regulator announced its ban in 2021 it also raised concerns about the ""integrity"" of the underlying crypto market, its volatility and its links to financial crime.

""Unless the case can be made that crypto has meaningfully changed in the last three years, it's hard to see why the FCA would authorise them,"" Prosser said, while the FCA's Consumer Duty rules requiring companies to demonstrate fair value for clients, introduced last year, ""places a lot more duty to assess risk on investment platforms"".

Jason Hollands, managing director of Bestinvest, a DIY investing platform, agreed.

""I am personally doubtful that the FCA will authorise bitcoin or other cryptocurrency ETFs to be made accessible to UK retail investors any time soon,"" he said. ""The FCA has repeatedly flagged concerns about the extreme volatility of cryptoassets, the high risk of losses and the difficulties retail investors face in valuing them.""","The UK is becoming increasingly isolated as one of few major global markets to hold back from approving retail access to cryptocurrency exchange traded products.

The article analyses the nature of voter support for Donald Trump on the basis of his performance in the New Hampshire primary. His victory over his nearest rival, Nikki Haley, both here and in the earlier Iowa caucus, has made it a near-certainty that he will secure the Republican Party nomination for another run at the presidency.

The article suggests that, if trends observed in New Hampshire are extrapolated to national level, Trump will attract the strongest support from lower income and less well-educated voters. It is noteworthy that voting in the New Hampshire primary is open to independents as well as registered Republicans. Trump did less well than his rival among uncommitted voters. Given the importance of swing states in US presidential elections, this could be a problem for him.

2024-02-01,Major Taylor: The first Black American global sports superstar,"Taylor overcame Jim Crow-era racism to become a world champion cyclist (Credit: Jules Beau, Gallica Digital Library & public domain)

Taylor soon caught the attention of Louis ""Birdie"" Munger, a retired penny farthing bicycle racer and entrepreneur. Munger tested how fast Taylor could sprint a single mile and timed him at two minutes and nine seconds - only two seconds behind the world record in 1893. Munger became Taylor's mentor, sponsor and coach. In 1895, Munger invited a young Taylor to live in Worcester, Massachusetts, where Munger had opened a new bicycle factory. Unlike in Indianapolis, Taylor was allowed to join the YMCA in this more-progressive community, and it was here where he began training in earnest.

""Major Taylor lived in Worcester most of his life, from 1895 to 1930,"" said Lynne Tolman, director of the Major Taylor Association non-profit that honours his legacy. ""The newspapers called him 'the Worcester Whirlwind'. There were still obstacles, to be sure, such as white neighbours' objections when Taylor bought a house in Worcester. But ultimately, Taylor made a comfortable home in Worcester, and Worcester remains justifiably proud that a local resident became an international sports superstar.""

As journalist Michael Kranish chronicles in his 2019 biography The World's Fastest Man, Taylor became a legend in his day, winning countless track races and smashing world records. A devout Christian, Taylor cultivated a straight-edge personality, abstaining from alcohol and tobacco and refusing to compete on Sundays. Even by today's modern racing standards, his stats remain astonishing. In 1898, for example, he sprinted 1km in 57.6 seconds - the current record set by Dutch cyclist Jeffrey Hoogland is 55.433 seconds.

Still, Taylor faced unending hostility in his home country. In 1885, the US League of American Wheelmen (now known as the League of American Bicyclists) attempted to ban Black people. Newspapers published mocking caricatures of Taylor, and when he was allowed to compete, brass bands would play ""Dixie"" (which originated with racist minstrel shows in the 1850s and became the de facto anthem of the Confederacy during the US Civil War) when his name was announced. Advertisements framed Taylor's races as a battle between Black and white athletes, and opponents routinely used vicious tactics on the track, attempting to trap him in a group or dangerously upend his bike. During one race in Taunton, Massachusetts, a white racer pulled Taylor from his bike and choked him into unconsciousness.","Taylor became a legend in his day, winning countless track races and smashing world records.

What went wrong at Jamie Oliver's UK restaurant chain, Jamie's Italian?

While Sliced Bread takes a break we serve up... Toast. A study of the spectacular failures of brands which had promised so much to consumers.

In each episode, the presenter and BBC business journalist, Sean Farrington, examines one big idea. What did it promise? Why did it fail? What can we learn from it today?

In this episode, Sean and the serial entrepreneur, Sam White, examine the fortunes of Jamie Oliver's Italian restaurant chain. It was a big hit when it launched so why couldn't it maintain that success?

Expert commentators - and Jamie Oliver himself - reflect on what made his restaurants so special and what led to their demise.

Tracey MacLeod, formerly of The Independent, was one of the first restaurant critics through the door; Emma Lake, Assistant Editor at The Caterer magazine wrote extensively about Jamie's Italian; Peter Harden, the co-founder of Harden's Restaurant Guide, has trawled through reviews of Jamie's Italian to see what changed from the customers' perspective.

Jamie Oliver's perspective comes through an interview he did with Kirsty Young for the Radio 4 series 'Young Again'.

If you have an idea for a topic with a toast moment then you can email the programme at toast@bbc.co.uk

Sliced Bread returns for a new batch of investigations in February. In the new series, Greg Foot will investigate more of the latest so-called wonder products to find out whether they really are the best thing since sliced bread. In the meantime, Toast is available in the Sliced Bread feed on BBC Sounds.

2024-02-01,'Buddies squad looks stronger now than before January': Behind the mic column,"It's 9:40am on 1 February as I sit down to write this. Transfer deadline day. Deadloan day more like (a terrible pun, but you know what I mean).

St Mirren have actually only signed two straight loan deals this window - midfielder Kwon Hyeok-kyu from Celtic and left-back Jaden Brown from Lincoln City.

James Scott is on loan from Exeter City but will sign a long-term deal at the end of the season, while Elvis Bwomono was a free agent before he signed in December.

Four new arrivals is possibly more than most supporters expected, and Stephen Robinson says the squad is stronger now than before the window opened, but is it strong enough for a top-six finish, or to earn a European place?

Sorry but I'm not going to answer my own question. As Paul Gascoigne once supposedly said: ""I don't make predictions and I never will"".

What I will venture is this. With Keanu Baccus coming back from international duty later this month and Ryan Strain, all being well, back from injury in the spring, the squad looks healthy with competition for places all over the park.

Unless of course a deadline day bid comes in for one of this season's standout players, or Aberdeen are tempted to try and lure the manager to Pittodrie.

If that vacancy had arisen at the end of September when the Paisley Saints were seven matches unbeaten in the Premiership, there would be serious grounds for concern. As it is, there's maybe just 'grounds for concern'.

I've just done a quick survey of the odds for the next Aberdeen boss, and Stephen Robinson is on every list as you'd expect, with one bookmakers offering odds as short as 4/1.

I'm trying to convince myself that's down to a couple of gamblers with more money than sense taking a punt on Robinson.

2024-02-01,Who do Aberdeen fans want as manager?,"Such is the turnover at Pittodrie that Aberdeen have had twice as many managers as the Conservatives have had UK Prime Ministers in the last three years.

Now, having sacked the latter for his side sitting in an ""unacceptable"" eighth place currently in the Scottish Premiership, they are seeking another one.

But who would get the vote from the Dons fans? We posed that very question and there's no real consensus, with Neil Warnock, Neil Lennon, Alex Neil, Stephen Robinson and Scott Brown among those mentioned most. And you can add your opinion here.

It would take up most of this article just to name all Warnock's previous clubs, but the possibility of Aberdeen becoming the 18th to be managed by the colourful and outspoken 75-year-old Englishman has captured a few headlines already.

Last in charge of Huddersfield Town in September, Warnock has a home in Scotland and has told BBC Scotland in the past about his desire to manage here, but the possibility of him being wheeled into Pittodrie has been greeted by a mixed response.

Joe: A proper appointment is a must. We have been lazy in our recruitment of managers and papering over cracks for a few years now since Derek McInnes. It has to be someone fired up and passionate about the fans/club. An appointment like Neil Warnock or John Eustace with Championship experience would be a massive step up, one we have needed for a couple seasons.

Gregor: Neil Warnock could be good interim boss - experienced, enthusiastic and disciplined.

Graham: For next manager: 1) Jose Mourhino 2) Andre Villas Boas 3) Neil Warnock 4) Alex McLeish.

Davis: Please, not Neil Warnock. We're already a laughing stock of Scottish football this year. Not ready to be the curtail of Warnock's professional comedy career in some PR stunt.

Ally: Don't want Neil Warnock near Aberdeen.

Karen: Definitely not Neil Warnock. Too defensive and a football dinosaur. Anybody but Neil Warnock!

Neil and Robinson just edge it as the most popular choices. The 42-year-old Neil, sacked by Stoke City in December, last managed in his homeland with Hamilton Academical back in 2015, while Northern Irishman Robinson, who is seven years older, currently leads fifth-top St Mirren.

Derek: I was in the minority against sacking Robson. We've sacked a manager each of the last four seasons and we still haven't improved. But he's gone now. I'd be looking at Alex Neil or Stephen Robinson.

Garry: Alex Neil being mentioned! Is he a winner? Been sacked more times than Lee Johnston has recently. There is a reason he is out of work.

Paddy: Alex Neil was my choice when Derek McIness left years ago. He was free then and is free now. Plenty experience in Scotland and also the Championship, which is as tough a league as any. The job he did at Hamilton before he left for Norwich City speaks for itself.

John: Barry Robson's time was up. He just couldn't see that three at the back never worked. I personally would take Alex Neil.

Stuart: Underwhelming season even after significant investment in summer, including squad building. After a few bad appointments, pressure on chairman Dave Cormack. Suggest Alex Neil.

Allan: I would hope they have someone in mind as new manager. I keep saying we have a decent squad of players but need an experienced manager in place to push them on. Stephen Robinson at St Mirren, or Alex Neil, would be my options, if they are interested.

Evan: Stephen Robinson would be a perfect fit for Aberdeen. He knows Scottish football in and out and has brought success in this league again and again at clubs with far lower budgets. He's a proven winner.

Laurence: Would like the next manager in for the Scottish Cup game. Can't see many potential managers within current league that I would like - perhaps Steve Robinson. Would rather a manager who has not recently retired from playing. Hopefully the successful applicant will bring a bit more fight with a bit more attacking mindset.

Former Celtic and Hibernian manager Lennon has been out of work since being sacked by Omonia Nicosia in October 2022, but in recent days the 52-year-old Northern Irishman has been interviewed for the Republic's vacancy.

Gary: We have a very good squad, but I think Barry Robson didn't know how to play/fit them into a system. I'd like to see Neil Lennon installed. Proven track record and did well with Hibs.

William: Maybe go for Neil Lennon - a proven winner.

Anon: Barry Robson tried to play the same formation/tactics in league all season, reluctant to change things. I would go for Paul Lambert or Neil Lennon.

Brown had a short spell as a player and coach at Pittodrie before the 38-year-old former Scotland and Celtic midfielder's lasted just four months in charge of Fleetwood Town then was appointed Ayr United head coach this month.

Andy: Do you think Scott Brown is kicking himself for going to Ayr?

John: We need a big character for the job and for me the only candidate is Scott Brown. I know he is under contract with Ayr United, but I think he would take the Dons job in a heartbeat. Go and get him Dave Cormack as he will sort out the lethargic performances of late in quick time.

Malky Mackay managed Watford, Cardiff City and Wigan Athletic before the 51-year-old became Scottish FA performance chief and a two-year spell with Ross County that ended in the sack in November.

Stephen: I would like to see Malky Mackay given another chance in the top flight. Aberdeen have a decent squad of players to work with and Malky could get the best out of them.

Meanwhile, some cast doe eyes at the previous management team of Derek McInnes and Tony Docherty - both currently in charge of sides above the Dons in the league table.

Charlie: We've been walking backwards since sacking Derek McInnes, which was a ridiculous decision. My choice now would be Tony Docherty, who is doing a great job at Dundee, knows the place and most of the players. He is a good tactician and would get the best out of the under-performing squad. The talent is there, just needs the right coach to harness it.

Niall: The board really need to focus on a head coach with a track record of success and, in the current climate, it's going to come at a cost. They could do worse than bringing back Derek MacInnes, who has turned Kilmarnock around on a tight budget.

Peter: We need someone with experience whom the players will respect and he'll be able to get the best out of them. This isn't Stephen Robinson or Alex Neil - perhaps not even Neil Lennon. (Same old names mentioned last time).

David: Nigel Clough has done fantastic jobs at Mansfield and Burton. Worth poaching and backing.

Scott: I'd be looking to Scandinavia, or perhaps Austria, or Switzerland for a manager. Someone like former Lillestrom caretaker Eirik Bakke would be ideal.

Daniel: The next appointment needs to break the current trend of managerial mediocrity with the last few being either novice appointments or a manager whose best season was a bottom-half finish with St Mirren. Aside from Alex Neil as a possibility, the Dons need to venture further afield than the Scottish merry-go-round for this one. Kjetil Knutsen (no longer with Bodo/Glimt)!

Sandy: Graham Potter for me - look at what he did with Ostersunds. A smaller team on a lesser budget - he is worth getting an opportunity. Let's have no best pals act from the chairman this time.","Neil Warnock, Neil Lennon, Alex Neil, Stephen Robinson and Scott Brown are all mentioned.

2024-02-01,"Smith '100% ready' for Test rugby, says Kvesic","Coverage: Listen on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, live text on BBC Sport website and app, watch on ITV1.

Uncapped fly-half Fin Smith is ""100% ready"" for international rugby, says his former Worcester Warriors team-mate and ex-England flanker Matt Kvesic.

The Northampton Saints fly-half and George Ford are Steve Borthwick's only two fit fly-halves after Marcus Smith was ruled out because of injury.

""It is just the perfect time to get him game time,"" Kvesic told BBC Sport.

""He is 100% ready for it and someone who I think over the next few years could be a really good player for England and a staple of the team.

""Fin needs the opportunity at international rugby. He is one of those players - and it sounds silly - but international rugby will almost suit him more.""

The 21-year-old made his Premiership debut for Worcester in 2021 as an 18-year-old before becoming a regular starter in the team during the 2021-22 season.

Alongside breaking into the Worcester senior team, Smith played an integral role in England Under-20s' Grand Slam in 2021 - starting four out of their five games.

""He must have been 18 or 19 fresh out of school and on debut even then in quite a mixed and underpowered Worcester team he looked the real deal to be fair,"" added former Warriors player Kvesic, who won four England caps.

""He just bossed the team really well. He was one of those kids that you felt comfortable running a game.

""He never had that arrogant attitude. Like you could tell he was good and he knew he was good, but he was always keen to learn and asked questions from everyone.""

Smith was picked up by Northampton following the demise of Warriors at the end of his first full season. This season he has steered the Saints to the knockout stages of the Champions Cup and top spot in the Premiership.

At only 20, Smith was included in Steve Borthwick's Six Nations squad last season but did not make an appearance.

""The fact he had to leave Worcester and go to a new environment with new players and coaches, maybe his development has accelerated having done that,"" Kvesic said.

""His mentality does not faze him. I would chuck him in at the deep end and I think he will thrive as opposed to survive.

""It is a good opportunity to get him some game time to play him and blood him in. The injury to Marcus Smith forces the hand anyway.""

Ford is likely to start the game against Italy meaning Smith could appear off the bench, in what will be his first appearance since his commanding European performance away against Munster.

The fly-half slotted a long-range drop-goal and helped guide 14-man Saints to an impressive away victory, showing his ability to take control of a game.

""He is a very well-rounded and balanced player. His real USP is how he manages, dictates and leads games. For a 21-year-old that is quite impressive,"" Kvesic explained.

""You pick your players on form and he is one of those players and it is the perfect opportunity to put his best foot forward and hopefully lead England through this Six Nations and maybe further beyond.","Uncapped fly-half Fin Smith is ""100% ready"" for international rugby, says former Worcester Warriors team-mate Matt Kvesic.

They also spoke of continuing problems with the Horizon IT system.

The Post Office said it was doing all it could to help postmasters.

But in an internal staff survey conducted last year, only 28% of those who responded said they thought it had their best interests at heart.

The Post Office was once one of the UK's most trusted brands, but the Horizon scandal has changed that, when faulty software made it look like money was missing from branches, resulting in hundreds of sub-postmasters and mistresses wrongfully prosecuted.

Over recent weeks, since ITV aired a drama about the scandal, current sub-postmasters have told the BBC of the daily struggles to keep their branches running.

Sara Barlow runs the post office on a busy village corner in Rainhill, on the outskirts of Liverpool.

Her shop walls are lined with cards, wrapping paper, and birthday balloons.

She's been here for five years and says that from her very first day, with the auditor watching over her shoulder, there was a shortfall in the Horizon computer system.

""That was not what I had signed up for. We'd signed up to run a nice little local business in a lovely community. From night one I was like 'what have I done?!'""

There's a constant stream of customers but Sara says that even in a busy branch like hers, it's very difficult to make any money without the shop business subsidising it.

As a founder member of the Voice of the Postmaster support group, she's been hearing from others who are now using foodbanks.

She says in recent weeks and months the Post Office head office has been engaging more, but nothing's really changed.

""We need something within the next couple of weeks. Time is running out, time's definitely running out,"" she says, adding that despite being responsible for huge sums of money she takes home less than the minimum wage.

""There are plenty of busy main branches in busy areas that aren't making a profit.""

Around 250 miles north in the village of Comrie in Perthshire, Marlene Wood says she has reached the end of her tether.

""There is no basic salary,"" she says. ""We're paid per transaction. The amount that we get to sell a first class stamp is 6p, so think how many first class stamps you're going to have to sell in order to make a very basic living.""

After pouring hours of work and thousands of pounds into the business over the last five years, Ms Wood has now put her post office up for sale.

She says the Horizon system produces faulty readings every week. She's in debt and at risk of losing her home.

""I moved here thinking that I was going to run a post office in a beautiful village. But the reality of it is that I have spent all our money propping it up, to keep it going.""

Residents of Comrie have started a fundraising page to help her keep the business open.

""I have no money,"" she says. ""My marriage has finished. I will probably end up sleeping on my mum's couch at the age of 53, because the reality is that no-one will want to buy. It's just toxic. Totally toxic.""

At the other end of the UK, in the small town of Ashburton on the outskirts of Dartmoor, Stuart Rogers has been trying novel approaches to make sure his post office turns a profit.

Mr Rogers has converted an old van into a mobile post office that travels to farms and villages nearby.

He has also revamped the upstairs of his building.

""We're the first post office in the country to have a banking facility, a library facility, and a post office in the same location,"" he says.

All the money invested was his own - and he says it was the only way to make his business viable.

""Although it brings no revenue, the hub and the library bring footfall and we need to convert that footfall into transactions.""

The frustration for Mr Rogers is that despite the time and effort he's putting in, the Horizon scandal is making his customers nervous.

""People have lost trust in the Post Office and we've got to rebuild that trust,"" he says.

The Post Office told the BBC: ""This is a challenging retail climate at present and it's right that we prioritise our limited funding at areas that will have the biggest impact for the most number of customers.

""We are doing all we can to drive footfall and remuneration opportunities for today's postmasters.

""With regards to any discrepancies, postmasters should call our branch support centre for them to resolve.""",Sub-postmasters across the country have told the BBC of the financial hardships they face.

2024-02-01,Interest rates held at 5.25% by Bank of England,"The Bank of England has held interest rates at 5.25% but has admitted for the first time that it has discussed cutting borrowing costs.

It said that it expected inflation - which measures the pace of price rises - to fall much more quickly this year.

Bank governor Andrew Bailey had been unequivocal that interest rates would have to stay higher for longer to ease inflation.

But on Thursday, he appeared to soften his language.

The Bank also revealed that, for the first time since the Covid pandemic struck in 2020, a member of the rate-setting committee had voted for a cut.

Inflation has fallen sharply since a 40-year peak in October 2022 to 4% last month.

The Bank is charged with keeping price growth at or close to a target of 2%.

It said in its latest inflation report that the figure will fall back to that target between April and June this year - quicker than it had previously expected.

Mr Bailey said: ""We have had good news on inflation over the past few months.""

However, he added: ""We need to see more evidence that inflation is set to fall all the way to the 2% target, and stay there, before we can lower interest rates.""

While the governor opened the door to a rate cut, he signalled it may still be some months away.

Minutes from the Bank's meeting this month revealed that there was a three-way split between the members of its rate-setting committee.

Six of the nine members voted to hold rates at 5.25%, two wanted to raise borrowing costs to 5.5% but one - Swati Dhingra - voted to cut rates.",Inflation has fallen sharply since a 40-year peak in October 2022 to 4% last month.

2024-02-01,Covid Inquiry: Alister Jack deleted WhatsApps to 'free up storage',"Scottish Secretary Alister Jack deleted all of his WhatsApps from during the pandemic, the UK Covid Inquiry has heard.

The Conservative minister said he erased his files to free up storage capacity on his phone in November 2021.

He expressed ""regret"" and said he would have not done so if he could ""turn the clock back"".

Mr Jack also said he did not believe Nicola Sturgeon when she denied trying to politicise the pandemic.

Ms Sturgeon and other senior figures from the Scottish government have been criticised for deleting messages sent during key phases of the crisis despite the former first minister giving an assurance to Channel 4 News in August 2021 that she would disclose them.

Asked about his own WhatsApps, Mr Jack he said he was not aware of any mobile messaging policies applying to UK government ministers at the time and had not considered retaining them to help him recall events from the pandemic.

""I just deleted all my WhatsApps,"" he told the inquiry, and said he had not considered retaining them to help him recall events from the pandemic.

Asked by Claire Mitchell KC on behalf of the Scottish Covid Bereaved group if he had any thoughts about keeping the messages, he replied: ""No, because I was keen for my phone to start working again.

""More importantly I knew that I did no government decisions by WhatsApp and that will be borne out by WhatsApps from ministers you do have.

""That is something I was not in the habit of doing.""

In her evidence on Wednesday, Ms Sturgeon rejected claims from UK government minister Michael Gove that the Scottish government sought ""political conflict"" during the pandemic.

Becoming emotional, she insisted ""the idea that in those horrendous days, weeks, I was thinking of political opportunity"" was ""not the case"".

Mr Jack told the inquiry that he ""didn't believe it for a minute"".

He added: ""I looked at her performance and thought she could cry from one eye if she wanted to.""

Mr Jack claimed tensions between the UK and Scottish governments were ""inevitable"" because Ms Sturgeon ""saw her job as leader of a nationalist government to break up the UK"".

He continued: ""Devolution works very well but works very well when both governments want to work together.

""But when one government wants to destroy the UK and destroy devolution, then there are tensions.""

Mr Jack said the Scottish government diverged with the rest of the UK on Covid rules ""for the sake of it"" - citing its five levels system of restrictions, compared to the UK government's three-tier system.

He described Scotland's system as ""farcical"", claiming it ""achieved nothing"" and ""unnecessarily"" affected hospitality businesses and the economy.

The Scottish secretary said that following meetings with the UK government, Scottish government figures would ""absorb the information but then worked out how they could do it but just slightly differently"".

""I felt that was a political manoeuvre on their behalf,"" he added.

Scottish government figures have previously told the inquiry they were caught off guard by Downing Street changing decisions with little or no notice.

Referencing Downing Street's decision in May 2020 to update coronavirus messaging from ""stay at home"" to ""stay alert"", Mr Jack expressed regret and said the Scottish government had a ""fair point"".

However, he said that mistrust was ""baked into the system"" and accused Ms Sturgeon of breaching the memorandum of understanding with the UK government following a Cobra meeting in March.

He also claimed the Scottish government did not reveal an outbreak at a Nike conference at the start of the pandemic in February 2020.

Earlier this week, former deputy first minister John Swinney told the inquiry Mr Jack, unlike his predecessor as Scottish secretary David Mundell, was not a ""help"" to the Scottish government.

Mr Swinney said there was ""no real value"" in engaging Mr Jack about decision making during the pandemic.

Mr Jack said this was ""absolutely not"" accurate.

He told the inquiry he was not on Mr Swinney or Ms Sturgeon's Christmas card list and had been embroiled in several court battles with the Scottish government.

Mr Jack said his position as Scottish secretary was not respected by Scottish government ministers, adding: ""They don't like the Scotland Office and they don't like my powers.""

He went on to accuse the Scottish government of creating a ""manufactured grievance"" over the UK government's furlough scheme in late 2020 amid concerns it would be required to facilitate a winter lockdown in Scotland.

Asked if he believed if Holyrood did not have the right to close the border between Scotland and England during the pandemic, the Scottish secretary said he felt the ""whole border thing"" was a ploy to portray Scotland as ""a separate country, a land apart"".

He denied suggestions from inquiry counsel Jamie Dawson KC that the relationship between the governments was akin to ""children squabbling with each other"".","Scottish Secretary Alister Jack says he erased all of his WhatsApps from during the pandemic. he said he did not consider retaining them to help him recall events from the crisis.

2024-02-01,Portsmouth sign Carlisle midfielder Moxon,"Portsmouth have signed Carlisle midfielder Owen Moxon on a three-and-a-half-year deal, for an undisclosed fee.

""Owen is a strong, powerful midfielder with an eye for goal and takes a very good set-piece,"" Pompey boss John Mousinho told the club website.

""He's mobile, knows how to handle the ball and we're excited to have him.""

Moxon was out of contract this summer and had been linked with a number of clubs in League One.

After coming through Carlisle's academy, Moxon had spells with Queen of the South and Annan before returning to Brunton Park in 2022.

He earned a place in the EFL League Two Team of the Season as the Cumbrians were promoted to League One last year, and was named player of the match in the play-off final win over Stockport.

Before this window Portsmouth had a number of positions they needed to strengthen. Midfield wasn't necessarily one of them, so this arrival highlights their proactiveness this January.

This move was largely agreed before Joe Morrell picked up his injury [against Oxford in midweek], but becomes more impressive if Morrell is to face a lengthy spell on the sidelines.

2024-02-01,Sweden: Where it's taboo for dads to skip parental leave,"It's been 50 years since Sweden introduced state-funded parental leave, designed for couples to share. The pioneering policy offers some surprising lessons for other countries.

Kjell Sarnold has a glint in his eye as he describes fond memories of his parental leave in the 1970s. His son was eight months old, and they bonded during a balmy September when his employer granted him four weeks off work on 90% of his salary - paid by the state - while his wife returned to work full-time.

""We went out for a lot of walks. I had one of those baby carriers on my back. We were outside all the time,"" says Sarnold, who was living in Stockholm's archipelago at the time. The period also involved changing countless nappies, lots of cooking and learning to comfort his son when he was upset. But on the whole, Sarnold loved it.

He doesn't work for a progressive start-up or a global corporation ramping up its employee experience policies. He's now a 74-year-old retired car mechanic, and his memories are from five decades ago, soon after Sweden became the first country in the world to introduce 180 days of state-funded parental leave that wasn't gender-specific. The idea was it could be shared between couples as they saw fit, giving the same rights to fathers and mothers.

Since 1974, when the policy became law, the number of paid parental-leave days has increased even further. Today, parents in Sweden (including LGBTQ+, adoptive and single parents) are legally entitled to a total of 480 days off work, one of the most generous state-funded packages on the planet. For the first 390 days, most parents can claim benefits equivalent to 80% of their salaries, up to a monthly salary cap of SEK47,750 ($4,650, £3,590). After that, there is a daily statutory compensation of SEK180 ($16, £14).

Sweden's approach offers plenty of insights for countries or workplaces that are looking to offer more gender-neutral childcare policies. Plus, there's a growing body of research highlighting the positive consequences of taking leave on parents' wellbeing. At the same time, however, equality campaigners argue that while Sweden's policies might seem utopic to feminist observers, its success in encouraging parents to share leave has stalled in recent years, and the majority of heterosexual couples still don't share their state-subsidised leave days 50/50.

Sweden's progress in encouraging time off for new fathers must be viewed in the context of its politics. While women's rights movements grew globally in the 1960s and 1970s, its ideologies quickly entered mainstream politics more rapidly in Sweden than in many other countries. Successive Social Democrat prime ministers, most notably Olof Palme, promised to boost gender equality and strengthen the welfare state, using taxes to fund the shift.

""One of the stated goals was to get fathers more involved in care work in the home... and at the same time make it possible for mothers to work more or go back to the workforce sooner,"" explains Ylva Moberg, a researcher at the Swedish Institute for Social Research, part of Stockholm University.","Sweden introduced state-funded parental leave, designed for couples to share.

2024-02-01,Conor Bradley: Seeing NI player score for Liverpool a 'special moment',"Liverpool fans from Northern Ireland have described witnessing Conor Bradley score his first goal for the club as a truly special moment.

Conor Bradley made history by being the first player from Northern Ireland to score for the Reds in 70 years.

Two fans from Bangor, County Down, at Anfield said seeing Bradley's shot hit the back of the net was fantastic.

Bradley, who is from Aghyaran, County Tyrone, has impressed since coming into the starting Liverpool line-up.

The 20-year-old scored his first goal for the club, as well as providing two assists on the night, in a 4-1 win over Chelsea on Wednesday.

Andy Gray and Thomas Campbell said seeing Conor Bradley's right-footed shot rifle past Chelsea goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic in the 39th minute was an unbelievable experience.

""When it went it in it was just one of the best moments and filled me with pride,"" Andy told BBC News NI.

""He's just turning into a real all-rounder of a player and what an exciting player he will be for Liverpool and Northern Ireland.""

Andy said seeing so many young players in the Northern Ireland squad breaking through and excelling is really encouraging.

""You have players like Shea Charles, Dan Ballard, even Trai Hume - another right-back who plays for Sunderland - all performing really well and that will only benefit the national side,"" Andy said.

""Especially when you have quality players like Steven Davis retiring, it's really encouraging to see these players come through and hopefully excelling for Northern Ireland for the future.""

Bradley's dazzling performance received a standing ovation from the Liverpool faithful when he went off in the second half to be replaced by Trent Alexander-Arnold.

Bradley's journey to the Premier League started a world away from the bright lights of English football's top flight, in Aghyaran - a hamlet in west County Tyrone.

It is about six miles from the town of Castlederg and 30 miles from Northern Ireland's second city, Londonderry.

His stock has risen quickly in the 10 years since his home club's coaches first marvelled at his talent, working through the youth ranks at the Merseyside giants before excelling during a loan spell at Bolton Wanderers in League One.

He has since become a regular in the senior Northern Ireland squad, amassing 13 caps at senior level.

""It's a very proud moment, something I dreamed of for a long time,"" Bradley told TNT Sports after the game.

""It feels like I'm in a dream. It's unbelievable.""

Former Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand described Bradley as ""phenomenal"", while ex-Rangers and Scotland international Ally McCoist described him as ""a breath of fresh air"".

Conor's former primary school, Omagh Christian Brother School, took to social media to praise the County Tyrone's native's performance.

2024-02-01,Winnett wins first Wales cap but North ruled out,"Coverage: Live on BBC One, S4C, BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Scotland, Radio Cymru & live text on the BBC Sport website and app. Highlights on Scrum V, Sunday, BBC Two Wales and online, 4 February and later on demand

Cardiff full-back Cameron Winnett will make his Wales debut in their Six Nations opener against Scotland on Saturday but centre George North misses out through injury.

At 21 years and 60 days, Dafydd Jenkins becomes Wales' second-youngest captain.

The lock is partnered by Adam Beard with Will Rowlands not included in the 23-man squad.

Rowlands has not linked up with Wales yet after his wife gave birth to their child.

Scarlets fly-half Sam Costelow make his first Six Nations appearance and partners Gareth Davies, who is preferred to the in-form Tomos Williams.

Prop Gareth Thomas is missing with loose-head Corey Domachowski also making his first Six Nations start.

There are nine Cardiff players in Wales' 23-man squad with five on the replacements' bench, including uncapped flanker Alex Mann.

Scotland have not won in Cardiff in 22 years and 11 attempts.

Wales team to face Scotland: Winnett; Dyer, Watkin, Tompkins, Adams; Costelow, G Davies; Domachowski, Elias, Brown, D Jenkins (capt), Beard, Botham, Reffell, Wainwright.

Replacements: Dee, Mathias, Assiratti, Teddy Williams, Mann, Tomos Williams, I Lloyd, Grady.

Wales are searching for a new full-back after Leigh Halfpenny and Liam Williams have dominated the number 15 jersey for more than a decade.

Halfpenny has retired from international rugby while Williams is unavailable because of his Japan club commitments.

Winnett, 21, has impressed this season for his club and was one of five new caps in Gatland's squad.

He suffered a jaw injury in the Champions Cup defeat to Harlequins in mid January which threatened to rule him out of the opening couple of games but has returned to training this week.

""Cameron is a lovely footballer and I think he's going to develop into a quality international player in the future,"" said Wales head coach Warren Gatland.

""He's young and there'll be no pressure on him. We've been impressed with the way he's trained.

""He's done well in training and following consultation with his surgeon everyone was happy for him to be selected.""

Winnett will line up for only his 16th professional game in a back three alongside wings Josh Adams and Rio Dyer, with Mason Grady on the bench.

The number 10 jersey has also needed to be filled after Dan Biggar's international retirement and injury to Gareth Anscombe.

Costelow has been given the opportunity with Scarlets team-mate Ioan Lloyd back on the international stage for the first time in three years after being named on the bench.

Wales have already lost stalwarts Alun Wyn Jones, Justin Tipuric, Ken Owens, Taulupe Faletau, Halfpenny, Biggar, Liam Williams and Dan Lydiate with those amount of caps coming close to 1,000.

There are seven survivors from the side who started the World Cup quarter-final defeat against Argentina in October 2023.

To lose centre North, Wales' third most capped player of all time behind Jones and Gethin Jenkins with 118 caps, is a big blow.

North is just one short of 50 Six Nations appearances and became the only Welshman to play in four World Cup quarter-finals last year.

The 31-year-old suffered the problem during the Ospreys' Challenge Cup victory against Lions on 21 January.

""George got quite a big stinger in terms of his shoulder and didn't take part in full training last week so Owen Watkin comes in,"" said Gatland.

Wales would have been hoping with to much disruption that the World Cup combination of North and Nick Tompkins would have been one area of continuity.

Tompkins will now be partnered by Ospreys centre Watkin, who last played for Wales in the defeat against Georgia in November 2022. This was the partnership that started Wales' victory against Scotland in Cardiff in 2022.

There was always going to be a fresh face in the Wales number three jersey after the trip of World Cup tight-head props Dillon Lewis, Henry Thomas and Tomas Francis were not included in the squad either through unavailability or not selected.

Dragons prop Brown has been given the nod ahead of Keiron Assiratti for his 24th cap in a front-row with Domachowski and Ryan Elias.

Brown's last start came against Argentina in July 2021 while he had a brief replacement appearance in the Six Nations defeat against Scotland in February 2023.

New captain Jenkins forms a lock partnership with Adam Beard with Teddy Williams providing the back-up with Rowlands absence.

""Will hasn't come into the squad yet,"" said Gatland.

""His wife had a baby a couple of weeks ago in France and unfortunately there were some complications.

""So the message to him has been you stay home and be with your family. We always talk about how important that is and he'll turn up when he's ready.""

With injuries to Jac Morgan, Faletau and Josh Macleod, there was a back row position to fill alongside Aaron Wainwright and Tommy Reffell.

2024-02-01,British Museum to put stolen items from its collection on show,"The British Museum will put 10 items stolen from its collection on show later this month.

The Roman gems, to be featured in an exhibition Rediscovering Gems, include a cameo with a bust of Cupid from the 1st or 2nd Century AD.

In August, the museum announced up to 2,000 objects from its storerooms were missing, stolen or damaged.

It has recovered about 350 items to date.

The exhibition will explore the significance of classical gems through history.

George Osborne, who chairs the museum's Board of Trustees, said the new display was an example of openness and ""culture change"" at the British Museum.

""We promised we'd show the world the gems that were stolen and recovered - rather than hide them away,"" he added.

The museum has released pictures of two of those gems that have been chosen for display.

Both were returned by Dr Ittai Gradel, the dealer and collector who alerted the British museum to the thefts, and was originally brushed off.

Dr Gradel told the BBC he had been ""delighted"" to work with the museum on the recovery process.

""I am greatly pleased also to see that the whole culture of the institution appears to be changing to one of much greater openness and willingness to confront problems, than what I encountered in 2021,"" he said.

Dr Gradel has played a major role in the recovery process, tracking down and returning hundreds of gems he had bought in good faith.

Gems he has returned and will now go on display include an intaglio made from black glass with a bust of Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom.

The new exhibition will also show more than 500 objects that were not caught up in the thefts. All the previously stolen items will be in their own display case and clearly labelled.

I've seen many of the recovered gems during our investigation of the story for BBC News.

They are made of stone or glass, variously coloured and tiny - often barely the size of a thumbnail.

They are a fascinating window into the ancient Mediterranean world, where they were worn as jewellery, used as seals and collected as objects of beauty in their own right.

They are engraved or cast, perhaps with the face of an Emperor, a Roman or Greek God or another depiction from a classical story.

Tom Harrison, keeper of the department of Greece and Rome, says the exhibition is ""an interesting opportunity to cast some light on an underappreciated and very beautiful art form"".

These types of gems were hugely popular in the 18th Century. But they fell out of favour.

That may be one explanation for why they were left, unregistered, in the British Museum storeroom for more than a century.

Dr Gradel said gems had been ""overlooked"" but provided ""beautiful and fascinating insights into the tastes and mindsets of the ancient Greeks and Romans"".

""They are indeed deserving of far more study than they have received,"" he told the BBC. ""I look greatly forward to visiting the exhibition"".

After an investigation discovered items had been stolen, a senior curator in the Greece and Rome department, Peter Higgs, was dismissed. He has previously denied any wrongdoing.

The police investigation is ongoing.

Following the controversy, German art historian and British Museum director Hartwig Fischer resigned and former Victoria and Albert (V&A) Museum director Sir Mark Jones was appointed in the interim.

2024-02-01,Isle of Man nurses surveyed on latest pay offer after recent dispute,"Nurses on the Isle of Man are being surveyed on a new pay deal put forward by Manx Care.

Royal College of Nursing (RCN) members are being asked for their views about a 6% pay offer for 2023-24 over the next fortnight.

It comes after a two-year dispute over pay and conditions ended in November.

Estephanie Dunn from the union said she hoped a new deal would be found ""much quicker"" but also raised concerns over back-pay for former staff.

RCN members walked out twice last year before a deal was agreed.

For the 2022-23 pay year, 71% of RCN members who voted backed an offer of a £1,500 consolidated payment and a 6% pay hike, which brought the row to an end.

Ms Dunn said it felt ""strange to be back out surveying members so soon after agreeing the last pay offer"" but ""we're still playing catch-up"".

She said strike action has meant a ""better resolution for all employees at Manx Care"" and hoped to reach a ""resolution on their pay much quicker"" for 2023-2024.

The union has also highlighted the offer did not include back-pay for staff who have left the employer.

An appeals process for individual cases has been set up by Manx Care, following a challenge by the islands joint trade unions, but staff must have continued to work bank shifts to be eligible.

Ms Dunn said the issue continued to be an ""uphill battle"" as ""we're always behind with pay offers it means that there's staff who have worked the hours but have since left"".

This makes them ""ineligible to claim for the additional monies they should have had anyway, if the pay offer had been agreed at the start of the pay year"".

The consultation opened on Wednesday and closes on 14 February.

2024-02-01,Mother of stillborn baby shares Gloucester maternity concerns,"A mother whose son was stillborn says she shares serious concerns raised about maternity services raised in a BBC Panorama programme.

Emma Ziff was refused an elective c-section by Gloucestershire Royal Hospital, and a 40-week appointment to review her case was never booked.

She attended the birth unit at 41 weeks with contractions and, after being sent home twice, was told her baby had died.

The trust that runs the hospital said it was ""deeply sorry"" over the death.

Ms Ziff said she wants to ""raise awareness and make sure lessons are learnt"".

She was 45 at the time of her pregnancy, and had raised concerns about her age, that the conception was via IVF and that it would be the first time she had given birth, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.

After a midwife refused her request for a c-section, Ms Ziff was told that if she had not given birth by 40 weeks, a consultant review would be booked to book one.

This appointment was never booked, however.

Ms Ziff attended the birth unit at 41 weeks with contractions. As the contractions were irregular, she was sent home on two separate occasions and re-admitted the next day when she was in pain and finding it difficult to cope.

However, the midwife couldn't find the baby's heartbeat and told Ms Ziff that her baby had died. She gave birth to her stillborn baby son, Otis, at 43 weeks.

A post-mortem confirmed that his death was caused by a lack of oxygen reaching her son in the womb.

Ms Ziff, who lived in Gloucester at the time of her pregnancy but has since moved to Spain, said she chose to share her story to raise awareness of the issues around midwives and consultants listening to mums.

""Had my wishes been listened to, heard and actioned by a doctor reviewing my care then the outcome would have been very different,"" Ms Ziff said.

Claire Stoneman, a medical negligence expert from Enable Law who represented Emma, said it was a tragically sad case.

""Pregnancy as you get older has higher risks in relation to stillbirth and mum [Ms Ziff] realised this which is why she asked to have a c-section.

""If she had been listened to in this case her baby would be with her now. No amount of money can ever compensate our client for the loss of her son.""

Kevin McNamara, chief executive of Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Trust, apologised over the incident.

He said the trust has improved its maternity services significantly over the past two years and brought in a new maternity leadership team.

""We are deeply sorry for the circumstances that led to the loss of baby Otis under our care in 2017.

""Learning from the cases that were shared on the Panorama programme this week has led to significant improvements to our maternity services over the past two years.

""The significant changes made have been driven by our staff, working closely with families and communities, to ensure everyone has a voice so that we provide the best and safest care.""

2024-02-01,"BBC Radio 4 - From Our Own Correspondent, Rebranding Indonesia's politicians","Presidential frontrunner Prabowo Subianto's image makeover - from military strongman to cuddly grandfather figure; plus stories from Argentina, Kenya, Colombia and Germany

Kate Adie introduces correspondents' reflections from Indonesia, Argentina, Kenya, Colombia and Germany.

Prabowo Subianto was once a military hardman at the forefront of Indonesian politics. He's run for the country's presidency twice before - and failed. Will it be third time lucky for him on the 14th of February? The BBC's former Indonesia correspondent Rebecca Henschke recently revisited the country and was startled by his apparent image makeover to appeal to first-time voters.

When Javier Milei was elected President of Argentina in November, it was largely thanks to his promises of radical change to save the economy. In Buenos Aires recently, James Menendez saw signs of fiscal distress everywhere.

Kenya's Penal Code outlaws abortion - with limited exceptions after cases of rape or incest, or where mothers are ill or aged under 18. Yet each year, tens of thousands of women and girls facing unwanted pregnancies resort to backstreet clinics, or try to induce terminations themselves. Linda Ngari explores the dangers they face - and the reasons they're willing to run the risk.

Going from armed rebel to eco-tourism enabler might seem a drastic career change - but it's a path some former guerrilla fighters in Colombia are keen to take. Zoe Gelber talked to some demobilised former members of the FARC movement who hope to make a more peaceful living guiding travellers through the rainforests they once fought in.

And Rob Crossan goes on the trail of the bratwurst in Nuremberg.

2024-02-01,Ireland Hockey: Ireland will make Pro League debut against world number one side Netherlands,"Ireland coach Mark Tumilty says the Pro League will provide the perfect build-up to the Olympic Games.

Ireland qualified for this summer's Games in Paris last month and head to India to make their debut in the Pro League.

They will face hosts India, Australia, Spain and the world number one ranked side Netherlands.

""It will be a good barometer of where we are in relation to the other nations,"" said Tumilty.

The Pro League is the elite competition in global hockey and consists of the top eight nations in the world with the winners of the Nations Cup gaining promotion to join them.

Ireland finished runners-up in the Nations Cup but gained their Pro League place when South Africa withdrew.

""I always said the Pro League was where we needed to be due to the level of opposition we get to play against,"" Tumilty told BBC Sport.

""A chance to play against India in front of their home crowd is definitely something to look forward to.

""I think we've learned most over the last 12 months or so playing against the tougher opposition. Some of those were tough defeats but you learn a lot more from those. We couldn't have asked for better preparation for Paris.

""I think it's something we have to get used to. It's something we want to do on a continuous basis is be at the top table of World Hockey and this is the start of it.""

The first series will commence in Bhubaneswar on February 10 and run till February 16. The participating teams will then relocate to Rourkela, India and recommence the competition on February 19 and run till February 25.

Ireland will get to play Belgium, Argentina, Germany and Great Britain in future rounds which will take place in May in Belgium and June at the Lee Valley Hockey Centre in London.

For this series in India, Tumilty has named a 23 strong squad with sixteen of the squad that helped Ireland qualify for the Olympics last month in Valencia included. Goalkeeper Davy Harte is a notable absentee while Kyle Marshall is injured.

Lisnagarvey goalkeeper James Milliken replaces Harte and Banbridge trio Charlie Rowe, Luke Witherow and Peter Brown as well as Ben Walker and Conor Empey are added to the squad.","Ireland coach Mark Tumilty says the Pro League will provide the perfect build-up to the Olympic Games.

Deutsche Bank has revealed plans to cut 3,500 jobs by the end of next year to slash its costs.

The German banking giant said the move is part of efforts to cut 2.5 billion euros (£2.1 billion) of costs to help improve its profits.

Deutsche Bank told investors the jobs cuts will be ""mainly in non-client-facing areas"".

The company employs around 90,000 people globally, with roughly 7,000 workers in the UK. It has not disclosed how many of its UK staff will be impacted.

The group will also streamline its marketing network, computer systems and software as part of the efficiency drive.

It came as the bank posted a profit of 4.2 billion euros (£3.6 billion) for 2023, declining by 16% against the previous year.

Deutsche Bank said it was impacted by a larger tax bill and increased provision for loan losses amid a slowdown in the German economy and continued uncertainty.

The group also said it plans to triple its dividend and buy back more shares as part of its efforts to win the backing of more shareholders.

Chief executive Christian Sewing said the results had ""demonstrated impressive resilience in a difficult environment, expanded our business and shown everyone our bank is sustainably profitable"".

James von Moltke, chief financial officer, said: ""We have reached an inflection point on key dimensions.

""We have delivered growth and capital strength while absorbing the twin impacts of continued investments and increased regulatory capital requirements.

2024-02-01,Kevin De Bruyne welcomes competition for places as Man City near full strength,"{{ #verifyErrors }}{{ message }}{{ /verifyErrors }}{{ ^verifyErrors }}Something went wrong. Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

Kevin De Bruyne is pleased Manchester City are close to full strength as the business end of the season approaches.

Erling Haaland returned to action after almost two months out as the champions eased to a 3-1 win over struggling Burnley in the Premier League on Wednesday.

With De Bruyne having made his first start since August and John Stones also featuring after a knock, City are in a healthy position as the pressure ramps up.

Defender Manuel Akanji is now the only absentee as City, five points off the top with a game in hand, battle with Liverpool and Arsenal for the title and prepare for the resumption of the Champions League.

""I think it's really good,"" said De Bruyne, who set up one of Julian Alvarez's two goals in a comfortable victory over the relegation-threatened Clarets at the Etihad Stadium.

""I think if Manu comes back - and I think it'll be soon - it's going to be the first time in the year everybody's fit, so that can only help us because I think the schedule is getting a little bit harder and harder in the next weeks.

""To have everybody available can only help the team being competitive. Even if you change (the team), there's big stars sitting on the bench and you can rotate.""

After a difficult spell in November, momentum is growing at City with eight wins in succession and 10 in their last 11 games in all competitions.

That could be ominous for their rivals but De Bruyne insists nothing will be taken for granted.

The Belgian said: ""I just think there is that feeling that whenever we lose a game, we're falling too far behind. And it's the same in the cup competitions - if you lose, you're out.

""So I think we're in a good moment, people are coming back, but we don't get complacent.""

City, who are next in action at Brentford on Monday, were far too strong for a Burnley side who remain seven points from safety.

Victory was all but secured as Alvarez, aided by some poor defending, struck twice in the space of six minutes midway through the first half.

The Argentinian World Cup winner has excelled this season in the absence of De Bruyne and Haaland.

De Bruyne said: ""He's been really good. I think he's played a lot in the midfield this year and that's not really his position, but he did a great job because obviously we had a lot of injuries.

""He's been banging in goals, giving assists, so he's probably happy. He's doing really good.""

Rodri added City's third goal early in the second half and Burnley barely registered a threat until grabbing a late consolation through Ameen Al-Dakhil.",Manchester City beat Burnley 3-1 at the Etihad Stadium in the Premier League.

2024-02-01,Minister admits flawed decisions led to hero Afghans being turned away,"{{ #verifyErrors }}{{ message }}{{ /verifyErrors }}{{ ^verifyErrors }}Something went wrong. Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

A Conservative defence minister has admitted that flawed decision-making led to Afghan special forces heroes being turned down for sanctuary in Britain.

In a major victory for The Independent, James Heappey confirmed the government will now re-examine the cases of around 400 special forces soldiers rejected for settlement in the UK.

The Armed Forces minister admitted some decisions were ""inconsistent"" and ""not robust"" and will be looked at again after a joint investigation by The Independent, Lighthouse Reports and Sky News.

Mr Heappey told the Commons there had been mistakes with the process of deciding on Afghan soldiers from two units are known as the Triples - Force 333 and Force 444.

In fresh hope they will be given a home in the UK, the minister promised a new team at the Ministry of Defence (MoD) will make sure ""decisions [are] changed if that is necessary"".

The Afghan soldiers were subjected to torture and murder at the hands of the Taliban after being denied help under the government's flagship Arap (Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy) scheme.

Our six-month long investigation revealed how cases were not being properly considered, even though the Triples soliders fitted the criteria and had evidence showing they worked ""shoulder to shoulder"" with British forces.

Mr Heappey said a recent review of processes around eligibility decisions showed ""instances of inconsistent application of the Arap criteria in certain cases"".

He promised the government would now ""take necessary steps"" to apply the criteria fairly. ""I can confirm that the MoD will undertake a reassessment of all eligibility decisions made for applications with credible claims of links to the Afghan specialist units.""

The minister also told MPs: ""Undoubtedly there have been some decisions made that are not robust and need to be reviewed ...We will now work quickly to make sure that these decisions are reviewed and cases and decisions changed if that is necessary.""

The Independent's joint investigation found that in some cases seemingly no consideration had been given to official certificates and ID cards showing their closeness with the UK special forces (UKSF).

In other instances, references from British colleagues and evidence of a payslip from the UK were ignored.

But Mr Heappey cautioned against the idea a blanket approval of 400 special forces soldiers under the Arap scheme - suggesting that there had been good reasons to turn some Aghans down.

He said the special forces cohort ""present a unique set of challenges in terms of eligibility decision-making"" - pointing out that some served in their units when the Afghan government that replaced the Taliban after the UK-US invasion was still getting set up.

Mr Heappey added: ""It is also the case that they did report directly into the government of Afghanistan, meaning we do not hold comprehensive employment or payment records in the same way we do for other applicants.""

If successful, the special forces soldiers will be allowed to bring their family members with them to the UK - meaning thousands in fear of their lives in Afghanistan and Pakistan could be given sanctuary.

Campaigners have welcomed the news that Triples cases will be re-examined - but have raised concerns over the department's desire to maintain a ""case-by-case"" review.

Colonel Simon Diggins, a former defence attaché in Kabul, said he was ""pleased to hear that the government has committed to review the Triples' cases"".

He added: ""I note that there is still a case-by-case review process planned: this must not be used as a delaying tactic as these brave men and their families are at risk. This must take days, not years.""

The abandonment of Afghan commandos has driven a number of them to travel to the UK via dangerous and irregular routes - journeys Mr Sunak has vowed to bring an end to with his pledge to ""stop the boats"".

Habibullah, whose name has been changed to protect his family in Afghanistan, arrived in Britain following a year-long tumultuous journey from Iran through Europe which culminated in the crossing in a dinghy from France.

""I never let down the British forces, I risked my life to help them. We've been for so many operations together, I was always there for them, but they let me down when I came to their country,"" he said.","Conservative defence minister James Heappey admits some decisions were ""inconsistent"" and ""not robust"" he promised a new team at the Ministry of Defence will make sure ""decisions [are] changed if that is necessary"" The Afghan soldiers were subjected to torture and murder at the hands of the Taliban after being denied help under the government's flagship Arap scheme.","[('taliban', 0.4766), ('afghan', 0.3625), ('heappey', 0.3474), ('soldiers', 0.3217), ('inconsistent', 0.3079), ('arap', 0.307), ('torture', 0.3057), ('subjected', 0.2709), ('government', 0.2459), ('decisions', 0.233)]","taliban, afghan, heappey, soldiers, inconsistent, arap, torture, subjected, government, decisions",7
2024-02-01,Taylor Swift's music catalogue vanishes from TikTok amid licensing dispute,"Taylor Swift's entire music catalogue has vanished from TikTok.

It comes after the world's biggest music company Universal Music Group said that it will no longer allow its music on TikTok now that a licensing deal between the two parties has expired.

UMG, which represents artists including Swift, Harry Styles, Drake, Adele, Bad Bunny and Billie Eilish, said on Wednesday (31 January) that it had not agreed to the terms of a new deal with TikTok, and plans to stop licensing content from the artists it represents on the social media platform that is owned by ByteDance, as well as TikTok Music services.

TikTok, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance, allows users to upload short-form videos that are usually soundtracked by licensed music, sound effects or samples from films and TV shows.

On Wednesday, Universal Music Group published an unprecedented open letter - titled ""Why We Must Call Time on TikTok"" - accusing the site of attempting to ""bully and intimidate"" the company into accepting a deal that was ""worth less"" than the previous one and not reflective of TikTok's ""exponential growth"".

UMG said that TikTok proposed paying its artists and songwriters at a rate that's a fraction of what other major social platforms pay, adding that TikTok makes up only about 1 one per cent of its total revenue.

""Ultimately TikTok is trying to build a music-based business, without paying fair value for the music,"" UMG said.

Now, it appears that the catalogue of music by the ""Cruel Summer"" singer has disappeared from the platform, while ""Good 4 U"" singer Olivia Rodrigo's songs have also vanished. Meanwhile, videos featuring UMG songs - such as a Kylie Jenner post set to Del Rey's ""Cherry"" and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's video to Rick Ross's ""Hustlin'"" - were muted.

Hitting back at UMG, TikTok accused the company of putting ""their own greed above the interests of their artists and songwriters"".

""Despite Universal's false narrative and rhetoric, the fact is they have chosen to walk away from the powerful support of a platform with well over a billion users that serves as a free promotional and discovery vehicle for their talent,"" it said, in a statement shared with The Independent.

Yet Universal Music also called new technology a potential threat to artists and said that TikTok is developing tools to enable, promote and encourage AI music creation. UMG accused the platform of ""demanding a contractual right which would allow this content to massively dilute the royalty pool for human artists, in a move that is nothing short of sponsoring artist replacement by AI.""

UMG also took issue with what it described as safety issues on TikTok, adding it is unsatisfied with TikTok's efforts to deal with what it says is hate speech, bigotry, bullying and harassment. It said that having troubling content removed from TikTok is a ""monumentally cumbersome and inefficient process which equates to the digital equivalent of 'Whack-a-Mole'"".

UMG said it proposed that TikTok take steps similar to what some of its other social media platform partners use, but that it was met with indifference at first, and then with intimidation.

""As our negotiations continued, TikTok attempted to bully us into accepting a deal worth less than the previous deal, far less than fair market value and not reflective of their exponential growth,"" UMG said.

""How did it try to intimidate us? By selectively removing the music of certain of our developing artists, while keeping on the platform our audience-driving global stars.""

The Independent has contacted Universal Music Group for additional comment.","Universal Music Group says it will no longer allow Taylor Swift's music on TikTok.

2024-02-01,Why Putin could be to blame for North Korea's latest provocative weapons tests,"Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile

The alarming frequency with which North Korea has been testing missiles since the start of the year, with Kim Jong-un making a particular point of showing off the country's naval firepower, has led observers to wonder if the launches signify the dawn of a new and sinister partnership involving Pyongyang and its ally Russia.

After the latest launches conducted on Tuesday, North Korea has now tested three waves of cruise missiles in the space of just one week. Kim himself oversaw tests of the brand-new submarine-fired, long-range ""Hwasal-2"", according to state news agency KCNA. Hwasal-2 was described as a ""strategic"" or nuclear-capable weapon that can deliver a nuclear warhead up to 1,242 miles (1,998km) - covering the distance between Pyongyang and US military bases in Japan.

The new launch came after North Korea conducted back-to-back tests of the submarine-fired ""Pulhwasal-3-31"" missile on 28 January and 24 January. Pyongyang said that its two missiles flew for more than two hours and were of ""strategic significance"".","North Korea has tested three waves of cruise missiles in the space of just one week.

2024-02-01,"Labour government will cap corporation tax for five years, says Rachel Reeves","{{ #verifyErrors }}{{ message }}{{ /verifyErrors }}{{ ^verifyErrors }}Something went wrong. Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

Labour will cap corporation tax at 25 per cent during the next parliament under a raft of new measures designed to kickstart the UK economy.

Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said on Thursday that the current level ""strikes the correct balance"" but hinted that she could even cut it if the UK's ""competitiveness comes under threat"".

The announcement came in front of gathering of business leaders at a sold-out event in London designed to win over executives ahead of a general election later this year.

The event is the latest bid by Labour to woo top firms and City of London executives ahead of the next election, with Ms Reeves introduced on Thursday by the boss of HSBC's innovation banking arm before taking part in a Q&A with Aviva chief executive Amanda Blanc.

Labour did not give any clarity on the circumstances or criteria under which corporation tax could fall, but Ms Reeves was clear to business leaders it would be kept under review.

""The next Labour government will make the pro-business choice and the pro-growth choice: We will cap the headline rate of corporation tax at its current rate of 25 per cent for the next parliament. And should our competitiveness come under threat, if necessary we will act.""

Ms Reeves' announcement follows a week of discussion and disagreement about Labour's fiscal policies. The shadow chancellor made headlines when she said Labour would not reverse the removal of the cap on banker's bonuses.

She told the BBC that the party ""does not have any intention of bringing that back"" and that while the cap on bonuses was ""the right thing to do to rebuild the public finances [...] that has gone now and we don't have any intention of bringing that back.""

Her comments sparked a backlash from some on the left of the party and trade union figures, who called on Labour to rethink its decision.

As chancellor, Rishi Sunak announced a rise in corporation tax from 19 per cent to the current 25 per cent rate for companies with profits over £250,000 - a move that came into force in April last year.

That move had provoked the ire of some free marketeer Tories, with Liz Truss pledging but ultimately failing to scrap the rise during her short-lived premiership.

Jeremy Corbyn's left-wing manifesto for Labour in the 2019 election had included a hike in corporation tax to 26 per cent. The decision to cap corporate tax at 25 per cent is a significant climbdown from the 2019 manifesto commitment, which pledged to raise corporation tax to 26 per cent.

But today Ms Reeves said that capping the figure means ""businesses can plan investment projects today, with the confidence of knowing how their returns will be taxed for the rest of this decade.""

She said: ""To those you in this room who might be wondering - do we really mean what we say? Has Labour really changed? Will warm words today be matched by action in government?

""Be in no doubt. We will campaign as a pro-business party - and we will govern as a pro-business party.""

The party have also been under fire for its gradual retreat from the £28bn green prosperity pledge, with shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds' giving the strongest hint yet that the party may drop the £28bn figure entirely.

The MP for Stalybridge and Hyde, in Greater Manchester, said it was Labour's ""ambition"" to carry out the multi-billion pound investment but warned that ""sometimes circumstances change"".

Sir Keir Starmer and his colleagues have been sounding warnings about the state of public finances and have suggested that the Tories may ""salt the earth"" to make it harder for Labour to make good on spending commitments.

The party have been preoccupied with trying to re-build their fiscal reputation, following a long-held attack line by the Conservatives that they are irresponsible with public money.

As a result, Sir Keir and Ms Reeves have been operating under an ethos of fiscal conservatism, with the shadow cabinet told not to make any pledges unless they are fully funded.","Labour will cap corporation tax at 25 per cent during the next parliament.

2024-02-01,Goalkeeper Jon McCracken makes loan return to Dundee,"{{ #verifyErrors }}{{ message }}{{ /verifyErrors }}{{ ^verifyErrors }}Something went wrong. Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

Dundee completed the cinch Premiership's first signing of transfer deadline day by taking Norwich goalkeeper Jon McCracken back to Dens Park on loan.

McCracken made four appearances for Dundee at the start of the season but lost his place when Trevor Carson joined from St Mirren and both parties agreed to terminate the loan deal in August.

The 23-year-old went on to join Accrington on an emergency loan and played 13 times and now cannot play for anyone else this season other than Dundee.

With Carson missing some recent games through injury, manager Tony Docherty told his club's website: ""It is important for me to have strong competition in every position for the last part of the season and I want that with our goalkeepers and bringing Jon in gives us a real level of competition.""

Celtic are set to wrap up the loan signing of Norwich striker Adam Idah after the 22-year-old arrived in Glasgow on Wednesday.

The Republic of Ireland international has scored 17 goals since graduating from the Canaries academy, with seven of them coming this season.

Several players could be on their way out of Celtic Park with David Turnbull and Mikey Johnston expected to join Cardiff and West Brom respectively, and James Forrest linked with an exit.

Gustaf Lagerbielke's proposed loan move to Italian side Lecce could be scuppered amid reports of further injury concerns over his fellow centre-back Cameron Carter-Vickers.

There could be big news at Rangers amid reports from Italy that Hellas Verona are set to launch a bid to sign striker Cyriel Dessers.

Rangers are expected to complete the signing of 20-year-old Colombian winger Oscar Cortes on loan from Lens with an option to buy after he arrived in Glasgow.

However, the Light Blues look to have been thwarted in their bid to land Brazilian left-back Jefte from Fluminense. They hoped to recruit the 20-year-old immediately, but he is currently on loan with APOEL Nicosia and the Cypriot club are reportedly intent on keeping him until the end of the campaign.

Livingston have signed midfielder David Carson from Inverness on an 18-month deal.

The 28-year-old made more than 160 appearances for Caley Thistle after joining from Morpeth Town in 2019.

Livi manager David Martindale, who is also hoping to sign a centre-back, said: ""He can play in a number positions but, for me, is best in a defensive midfield role. He has bags of endeavour and desire to work hard for the team and I'm sure this will see him quickly become a fans favourite.""

Motherwell are still looking for at least one further addition after signing 22-year-old Welsh forward Jack Vale on loan from Blackburn on Wednesday, and assistant manager Stephen Frail gave fans fresh hope there might be a loan return for Groningen striker Kevin van Veen.

""I'm not sure anything's out the water,"" Frail said on Thursday morning.

""That could be one of those last-minute things. There will be one or two people that the manager and recruitment team are looking to bring in.""

Aberdeen are said to have had a bid rejected in an effort to re-sign Mattie Pollock on loan from Watford, a day after Barry Robson was sacked as manager.

Hearts forward Lawrence Shankland has been the subject of intense speculation in recent months, but the Jambos go into the final day of the window without any notable approaches having been made for their top scorer.

The Edinburgh club signed Scott Fraser on Wednesday, but it looks unlikely that they will secure Yan Dhanda before the deadline after the Ross County playmaker agreed a pre-contract to move to Tynecastle in the summer.

Staggies boss Derek Adams said on Tuesday he expects the 25-year-old to remain in Dingwall for the rest of the season, while he hopes to add at least one or possibly two new players.

St Johnstone are reportedly hoping to land 25-year-old striker Adama Sidibeh from English non-league side Warrington Rylands.

Hibernian are another club in the market for a central defender while Kilmarnock and St Mirren have also been linked with loan moves for Van Veen.

Killie manager Derek McInnes said on Wednesday ""we may still look to add one if we can"".

2024-02-01,Death in Paradise star 'annoyed' by original character's return in 2024 series,"An originalDeath in Paradise cast member is set to return for the show's 1,000th episode, which has ""slightly annoyed"" its lead star

More than 10 years after the actor made their debut on the BBC series, the character will be returning for a celebratory instalment set to be broadcast on Sunday (4 February)

*Spoilers follow - you have been warned*

The show's lead, Neville Parker actor Ralf Little, has revealed that Sean Maguire, who played Marlon Collins when the show first aired in 2010, will be back for the special episode.

While Little acknowledged ""it was very exciting"" to see Maguire return and called it a treat for ""eagle-eyed viewers"" as not much fuss is made about the character's return.

However, Little has admitted he was ""slightly annoyed"" by his appearance.

Speaking to media outlets ahead of the show's return, the actor said: ""I'm slightly annoyed though because he's now the only other person apart from me to have done the show twice. Although that said, he was playing the same character and I'm the only person to have done it as two different characters, so I still have that little personal milestone!""

Little has played Neville since 2020, but before that, in 2014, the Royle Family star made a guest appearance as another character entirely.

The actor said that Marlon's reappearance will be detected by ""eagle-eyed viewers"" only as not much fuss is made about the character's return.

The fact he's back after so long is not ""really referenced in the episode"", Little said, adding of Maguire: ""I've met Sean a handful of times, and I just loved him. He was fun, funny, professional and a brilliant actor.""

The new series will feature an array of guest stars, including Hayley Mills, Richard Fleeshman and Pearce Quigley.

Elsewhere in the series, there are also appearances from a number of other famous faces. Speaking about the other guests, he said: ""It's always nice to have friends come out which has been great for me, like Richard Fleeshman, who I've known for twenty years. He's a great actor and a lovely lad.

Little admitted to being the only guest star he's ""got starstruck by"", stating: ""With somebody who has that reputation and experience, it wouldn't be outside the realms of possibility for her to be diva-ish, difficult, demanding, but she was the most gentle, professional, sweet, fun, funny, gregarious person... just the dream! A living legend of the industry.""","An originalDeath in Paradise cast member is set to return for the show's 1,000th episode.

Footage from 17 January shows the avalanche crashing down the mountain in Juneau, having been triggered by crew from the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities.

The department said the team demonstrated ""exceptional skill"" by bringing down several avalanches to minimize hazards above Thane Road, resulting in the prompt reopening of the route to traffic.

While the idea of forcibly triggering an avalanche for safety reasons is strange, forcing small, controlled ones often prevents a larger avalanche from occurring.","Footage from 17 January shows the avalanche crashing down the mountain in Juneau.

2024-02-01,How Ireland can cure World Cup hangover and fill Johnny Sexton void,"{{ #verifyErrors }}{{ message }}{{ /verifyErrors }}{{ ^verifyErrors }}Something went wrong. Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

The hangover has lasted for four months, fractured snatches of those Parisian nights coming crashing back into heads still aching with the foggy recollections of a golden chance missed.

For France and Ireland, the tales of the autumn were strikingly similar, so close; so far - two World Cup adventures set up for success prematurely ended by a single score. A bounce of a ball, a flip of a coin, a perfectly timed Cheslin Kolbe charge-down or Sam Whitelock jackal: for a third men's World Cup in a row, France and Ireland's final fortnight was spent as spectators.

These two were the defining sides of the last World Cup cycle, meticulously constructing a contender in the hopes of ending their tournament hoodoo. France coach Fabien Galthie and Andy Farrell, his Irish counterpart, identified areas in need of improvement and duly improved them, bringing through key personnel and developing depth. They entered, and exited, the World Cup with few apparent weaknesses; either would have been a worthy winner.

Both came up short. ""Four years of consistent progress, the only objective was to be world champion,"" Galthie said late last year. ""One point is nothing, but one point is everything. We'll be scarred for life and that's part of our journey.""

And now it is time to pick up the pieces and start all over again with a fresh challenge. It feels fitting for these two to hit the rest button on men's international rugby with the first fully-fledged fixture since the World Cup's conclusion, and a Six Nations opener that may yet prove this year's defining, deciding game.

This clash of grand slam champions will feel somewhat fresh. Partly, that is due to a new amphitheatre, the impending arrival of the Olympics in the French capital necessitating a shift south from the Stade de France; Marseille's Stade Velodrome is a wondrous sporting cathedral and a fitting stage.

But the sense of the nouveau is best identified in the spaces left by those no longer here. Johnny Sexton and Antoine Dupont were the faces of their nations, primordial to the projects upon which they embarked and the embodiment of the rugby philosophies around which these two were sculpted.

Sexton has for so long been central to this Irish side, both its backbone and its brain. Careful management enabled Farrell to eke out the last drops of an outstanding vintage, but in doing so perhaps stalled the progress of a successor. Jack Crowley's emergence, then, is timely, the Munsterman having kicked his province to United Rugby Championship victory last season and now ready for his international chance.

""I think it's got to happen organically; it's got to be genuine,"" said Crowley of how he will step up with Sexton gone. ""For me, it's been trying to learn so much from Johnny over the last two years and absorb as much as I could. I need to grow and understand myself and my game and how I can impact this group.""

Peter O'Mahony's elevation to the captaincy should ensure a steady, disciplined ship. The blindside remains one of Ireland's best at 34 years old, though the peculiar reluctance of the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) to hand their new skipper a central contract has put Munster in a bind with O'Mahony up for renewal. The flanker has insisted his full focus is on this campaign but the sort of club/country tensions avoided in the last cycle threaten to bubble in the background.

That much is true of France, too, where the alignment achieved in the build-up to a home World Cup seems to have been rolled back slightly. The Top 14 clubs were generous in making their players available ahead of that tournament, but a complex system has been settled on for this campaign that sees much more to-ing and fro-ing of fringe squad members, which would seem to suit no-one.

Dupont will be back after the Olympics but his departure to the sevens circuit leaves even this remarkably gifted French side seeking a new nucleus around which their free electrons can whizz. Romain Ntamack, his running mate, remains out, too, so it is fortunate for Fabien Galthie can count on a club pairing in red hot form. Maxime Lucu and Matthieu Jalibert are joined by fellow Bordeaux-Begles Yoram Moefana, Louis Bielle-Biarrey and Damian Penaud in the French 23 with no side playing better attacking rugby in Europe this season.

The pieces elsewhere, largely, remain the same for France, though it is a shame that the kaiju Emmanuel Meafou will have to wait for an international arrival due to injury. Galthie can at least call on the colossal Uini Atonio and Romain Taofifenua, who postponed planned international retirements after the World Cup, to help compensate.

That both coaches have opted for six forwards on the bench speaks to an expectation of another bruising battle. The Stade de France is far from staid but when France visited Marseille in the autumn of 2022 to encounter South Africa, the atmosphere was positively febrile, and the Friday night lights should give this opening game a real sense of occasion. There are plenty of courses to be served in this Six Nations but this is not your traditional appetiser.

""We all know it's going to be a war of attrition,"" said Farrell on Wednesday when unveiling his team. ""It's mouth-watering, isn't it? The stadium, the atmosphere, it being the first game of the Six Nations after a World Cup, if you can't get excited about that, you're in the wrong place.

""For us, it's just living up to our own expectations, we expect to perform on the big stage and it doesn't really get any bigger than this one. We've got to relish these types of occasions and go after them.""",Fabien Galthie and Andy Farrell unveil their men's international rugby team.

2024-02-01,Carlos Sainz and eight other potential replacements for Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes,"Lewis Hamilton could be set to make a shock move from Mercedes to Ferrari ahead of the 2025 season.

The British driver has been at Mercedes for more than a decade, including six of his seven world titles with the team, but Hamilton has not won an F1 race for over two years as the team have dropped behind Red Bull.

It would come as a surprise with the start of the 2024 season just weeks away and after the driver signed an extension to his contract until the end of the 2025 season.

It is expected that with Charles Leclerc having signed a long-term extension with Ferrari last week, Hamilton would replace Carlos Sainz next year at the iconic Italian team, when the Spanish driver's contract runs out at the end of 2024.

Here is a look at who could replace Hamilton at Mercedes.

A straight-swap deal could be the most obvious move for Mercedes. Sainz was out of contract at Ferrari at the end of this year anyway and will now be looking for a new team for 2025.

Sainz is a two-time race winner, most recently with a terrific drive in Singapore last year, and has been on the podium 18 times during his nine-year career in F1 so far.

The 29-year-old will be looking for his fifth team, having previously driven for Toro Rosso, Renault and McLaren prior to Ferrari.

Another man likely to be out of a job come the end of 2024, Sergio Perez's deal at Red Bull expires at the end of the new season.

An extension appears unlikely at this stage, given the gap to team-mate Max Verstappen last year as Christian Horner's team look to maximise points armed with the quickest car on the grid.

Rumours were bound last year that the Mexican could potentially retire after he leaves Red Bull. Should he decide not to after this year though - what would be his 14th straight season in the sport - Perez may want to reach out to Wolff and Mercedes.

Has the Brit showed his hand too soon? The 24-year-old signed a new long-term deal at McLaren last week, taking him beyond 2025 with the papaya and into the next era of regulation changes.

Yet Norris, who is still searching for his first win in F1, is one of the fastest drivers on the grid and Wolff could well look to land Norris to replace Hamilton - and maintain an all-British feel to the garage.

That being said, it would take some serious money to do so now.

Continually shining at Williams - where Mercedes have signed their last two drivers from - Albon would represent a promising choice to replace Hamilton.

Having come through Red Bull's junior programme, the British-Thai driver was dropped at the end of 2020 after struggling during his 18-month stint as Max Verstappen's team-mate.

But following a year in the wilderness in 2021, Albon joined backmarker Williams and is now the team's unequivocal No 1 driver. The 27-year-old scored 27 points last year as he guided James Vowles' (Wolff's former right-hand man at Mercedes) team to seventh in the constructors' championship.

Who has the two-time world champion not driven for, I hear you ask? Well, Mercedes is one such team.

The 42-year-old was a revelation in his first season for Aston Martin last year, securing eight podiums as he finished fourth in the drivers' championship.

Despite his age, the Spaniard shows no signs of retirement just yet and a move to the Silver Arrows could well give him one final, realistic shot at a third world title.

Schumacher, son of seven-time world champion Michael, is currently Mercedes' reserve driver and was present on the pitwall last year.

Having been dropped by Haas at the end of 2022 following two tumultuous years, the 24-year-old is desperate for a route back onto the grid.

However, given his struggles and somewhat regular collisions with the wall at Haas, it would be an unlikely choice.

The wildcard pick.

The Italian 17-year-old is one of the most highly-regarded prospects in world motorsport. Such is his promise having won the Formula Regional championships in 2023 in both the Middle East and Europe, he is this year skipping F3 to make his F2 debut for Prema Racing, alongside British teenager Ollie Bearman.

A member of Mercedes' young driver programme, Antonelli's promotion to one of the sport's juggernauts in 2025 - when he would be just 18 - would represent something of a gamble.

Should he shine in F2 from the get-go though, he could emerge as a serious contender from within the Silver Arrows ecosystem.

Esteban Ocon - Alpine driver was a reserve at Mercedes and has a good relationship with Wolff.

Daniel Ricciardo - Should the Aussie impress this season for Red Bull's sister team (note to self: don't call them the Visa Cash App RB team), Ricciardo could put his name in the mix.

Valtteri Bottas - A return for the safe-hands Finn? It would appear unlikely - yet so seemed Hamilton moving to Ferrari.

Sebastian Vettel - The ultimate comeback story for the four-time world champion German, returning to a German team? Who's to say Wolff would not at least ask the question.",Lewis Hamilton has not won an F1 race for over two years with Mercedes.

2024-02-01,The best solo cruise lines for single passengers,"Cruises are a well-trodden holiday option, offering the opportunity to explore various parts of the world while enjoying the comfort on a hotel on the seas.

And though a cruise with a significant other or the rest of the family is a perennially popular choice, fewer people think of taking the solo option and booking a cruise alone.

But these holidays can be just as rewarding and enjoyable, giving you as much flexibility as you want along with opportunities to meet like-minded travellers and see some of the world's finest tourist destinations.

Daily activities will keep you entertained while onboard, while organised excursions or solo trips let you see a magnificent range of towns and cities at your leisure. Solo-specific events mean that meeting other travellers is as easy as sitting down to dinner, while you'll have a comfortable solo cabin to come back to at the end of each day.

If you've got the itch to book, we've rounded up a selection of the best cruise liners for single passengers below.

Riviera Travel operates river cruises around the world, with destinations as far as Egypt and Vietnam. Nevertheless, the focus is on European river cruises, with plenty of packages to the Rhine, Rhone, Seine, Douro and Danube on offer. Packages include return flights, airport transfers and all meals onboard, with an extensive range of excursions and activities including guided tours and on-board folk music shows.

Read more on cruise travel:

European river cruises are the only option that Riviera offers for solo travellers, with seven routes that cover the continent's main rivers. Prices include all the same features as a standard booking - such as excursions, onboard meals and Wi-Fi - but with spacious single occupancy cabins and welcome dinners to help you meet people. Solo bookings also include the 'superior' drinks package, which gives guests an extensive selection of alcoholic drinks available both at lunch and between 6pm and midnight. The Rhine and Moselle package is their most affordable, starting in Cologne and taking you to beautiful towns like Koblenz and Rudesheim.

Virgin Voyages offers adult-only cruises packed with a huge range of activities, from morning yoga classes to evening cabaret. There are plenty of solo cabins - their inaugural ship, Scarlet Lady, has 46 - and itineraries include solo meet-ups, activities and excursions with plenty of opportunities to meet other single travellers.

Packages include food, drink and activities as standard. With only four ships in the fleet, your choice of destination is slightly more limited, though you can still visit picturesque locations in Europe, the Caribbean, parts of Southern Asia and Australia. The Southeastern Caribbean Isles package will take you on a roundtrip from Puerto Rico, stopping in Guadeloupe, Barbados, St Lucia and Antigua.

Tauck claims to have specialised in solo travel for over 90 years, and today this translates to special solo savings and no single supplement on European river cruises. Travellers looking to see the continent 'solo style' can benefit from savings of up to £750, and will enjoy more stylish, contemporary ships with fewer guests for an overall more luxurious experience. Trips cover Europe's main waterways, and prices include all food, drink, activities and shore tours. Choose the Yuletide package between Brussels and Amsterdam for a festive experience at some of the best Christmas markets - and prettiest waterways - on the continent.

Ambassador is a new cruise line where trips begin in cities around the UK, including Liverpool, Belfast, Dundee and Bristol. Both Ambience and Ambition have 89 dedicated cabins set aside for solo travellers, available ""at a special single supplement against the equivalent twin fare based on selected single cabin categories"". The operator journeys to a vast range of destinations considering there are only two ships in its fleet, with voyages going as far as Singapore, Brazil and New Zealand.

Ambassador's cruises contain an extensive programme of activities for solo passengers, including a 'Welcome Get Together' and guided tours together with other solo travellers. Other onboard entertainment ranges from West End-style shows to comedy nights, with plenty of opportunities to meet others. If cruising during winter, visit Norway to see wondrous fjords and (possibly) the aurora borealis, with the Land of the Northern Lights package.

Oceania has made considerable investment in providing options for solo travellers, with its newest ship, Vista, containing six 270-square-foot solo cabins that include balconies, premium lounge access and a welcome bottle of champagne. It has fitted its older ships with 14 'Solo Staterooms', all of which offer magnificent sea views.

Oceania voyages make it easy to meet like-minded travellers with solo meet-and-greet events, large mixed dining tables, mixed shore excursions and single-traveller activities such as art classes. Destinations range from the Mediterranean and Scandinavia to South Africa and the tropics, meaning solo travellers have opportunities to see a large portion of the world alone. Book the 14-day Miami to Tenerife cruise to experience Mediterranean charm and Caribbean beauty in late March.

Royal Caribbean say that they do not ""have specific pricing for single occupancy"" cabins, but that they do offer single cabins on some of their ships, including Brilliance of the Seas, Anthem of the Seas, Quantum of the Seas, Ovation of the Seas, Harmony of the Seas and Spectrum of the Seas. These cruises ""can be reserved by someone cruising alone without the usual single supplement fee"", and they cover an extensive range of destinations, from Europe to the Caribbean and Singapore to Australia.

Passengers can reserve inside studio staterooms, virtual balcony staterooms and super studio ocean view stateroom with balconies, giving them between 101 and 199 square feet of space. Everything else will be the same as usual, meaning you can enjoy the same benefits as every other guests without paying a premium. If departing from the UK, the only tours available take you around Europe; the most extensive is the Mediterranean Cities package, covering Seville, Sardinia, Rome, Lisbon and more.","European river cruises are the only option that Riviera Travel offers for solo travellers.

2024-02-01,UK interest rates kept at 5.25% as inflation target could be reached by summer,"{{ #verifyErrors }}{{ message }}{{ /verifyErrors }}{{ ^verifyErrors }}Something went wrong. Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

The Bank of England has kept interest rates at 5.25% as it forecast that inflation is set to fall to its target level a year and a half earlier than expected.

Policymakers on the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to hold rates at their near 16-year high for at least another month.

Andrew Bailey, the Bank's Governor, said there had been ""good news"" on inflation in recent months but that the committee needs to see more evidence that inflation will fall ""all the way to the 2% target, and stay there"" before it can lower interest rates.

Although the lack of a cut to rates might hit mortgage holders harder, new inflation forecasts from the Bank could bring some relief to households grappling with the cost-of-living crisis.

The rate of Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation is set to fall to 2% between April and June this year, about 18 months earlier than previous forecasts, according to the latest Monetary Policy Report.

However, it will only stay at the target level temporarily before increasing during the second half of the year, and could rise to 2.8% by the first three months of 2025.

Energy prices are expected to be a key driver of the level of inflation throughout the year.","Policymakers on the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to hold rates at their near 16-year high.

2024-02-01,India's Modi avoids major giveaways in final budget before general election,"Prime minister Narendra Modi's government on Thursday presented its last budget to parliament before India heads to the national election slated in May.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the interim budget for 2024 will be focused on improving conditions for the poor, women, youth and farmers and the next five years will see unprecedented economic growth in India.

""The economy has undergone a profound transformation,"" Ms Sitharaman said in parliament as she presented the budget.

Ms Sitharaman unveiled initiatives aimed at enhancing tourism, housing, and adoption of renewable energy. However, the allocated funds for infrastructure development, including roads, ports, and airports, in the world's fastest-growing major economy fell short of anticipation.

The budget was widely expected to be an economic manifesto to lure voters ahead of the election but there were no big giveaways apart from the for a programme aimed at providing free electricity through rooftop solar projects to 10 million households.

Transportation and defence expenditures ranked as the second and third highest expenses for the government. In 2024-25, aside from interest payments, rural expenditures experienced the most substantial rise, increasing by 11 per cent.

What are the key takeaways from the budget?

No changes in income tax which will be biggest income generator for government

There will be no changes in the existing income tax regime for the salaried middle class in both direct and indirect taxes. Taxpayers will not receive any relief as income tax rates and slabs remain unchanged.

""I propose to retain the same tax rates for direct and indirect taxes including import duties,"" the finance minister said.

The majority of government financial resources originate from borrowings, constituting the primary source. However, the second most significant contributor, or the leading income generator, are income tax revenues.

According to the budget, income tax revenues are projected to comprise 19 per cent of all government resources in fiscal year 2024-2025. Corporate tax is expected to contribute 17 per cent, Goods and Services Tax (VAT) 18 per cent, and borrowings 28 per cent.

High public spending in infrastructure and government schemes

This year, over Rs 10 trillion (£102bn) has been allocated to construct physical assets such as roads and ports, marking an 11 per cent increase from last year. However, this allocation is less than the nearly three-fold annual increases that India has seen since 2019.

Ms Sitharaman announced that the government plans to construct 20 million affordable houses over the next five years, in addition to the nearly 30 million houses already built.

Government spendings announced in Modi government's flagship development schemes include a rural employment guarantee and programmes to provide safe drinking water along with cash transfers to farmers.

The government will also launch a scheme for housing for the middle class, she said, without providing details.

Reduction in fiscal deficit

The budget has significantly narrowed its fiscal deficit to 5.1 per cent.

The fiscal deficit is the gap between what it earns and spends. It shows the amount of money that the government borrows from the market

This implies reduced market borrowings for the country in a good news, resulting in a rally in India's bond markets. The finance minister has set a target of 4.5 per cent fiscal deficit by 2026.

Reducing the fiscal deficit will provide reassurance to foreign investors and rating agencies, who have expressed concerns about India's ability to achieve its target of reducing the deficit to below 4.5 per cent of GDP within the next two years.

Cuts in health and education

Health and education budget allocations in India are often significantly below the country's actual needs. However, the revised estimates indicate that even these targets were not met in the current financial year.

The government had allocated Rs 1,164bn (£11bn) for education spending but ultimately spent Rs 10,878bn (£03bn).

Similarly, in the health sector, it allocated funds for Rs8,895bn (£84bn) but ended up spending only Rs7,900bn (£75bn).

Focus on green energy

In pursuit of achieving 'net zero' by 2070, the government said it will extend funding to tap into the offshore wind energy potential, starting with an initial capacity of one gigawatt. By 2030, the government plans include establishing a coal gasification and liquefaction capacity of 100 million tonnes, which will aid in curtailing imports of natural gas, methanol, and ammonia.","Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents interim budget for 2024.

2024-02-01,Flu and norovirus hospital admissions hit new winter high amid NHS 'permacrisis',"The number of patients in hospital with flu and norovirus has surged to a new winter high as doctors and health leaders warn seasonal illnesses are piling pressure on the NHS.

Weekly NHS England figures show an average of 2,226 patients were in hospital each day with the flu last week, up from 1,312 a month earlier and compared to 1,290 in the same week last year.

Data also shows an average of 688 patients were in hospital each day last week with norovirus - up 80 per cent from December and 75 per cent higher than this time last year.

It comes as top emergency care doctors warn the NHS remains in a ""permacrisis"" after the government's A&E plan - launched last year - has had ""little or no"" positive impact on hospitals.

Responding to the figures, Adam Brimelow, the director of communications at NHS Providers, said: ""There's been no respite for the NHS this week with a major spike in winter bugs, including norovirus, flu and Covid-19, piling the pressure on the health service.""

He said pressures are compounded by ""worrying"" levels of staff sickness, with 49,212 out of work each day last week - 727 more than the same week last year. The ""double whammy"" of winter pressures and the cost of living crisis had worsened the situation for the NHS, he added.

Meanwhile, there has been an increase in ambulance callouts and handover delays.

The latest NHS performance figures show that 34 per cent of hospital patients in England arriving by ambulance in the week to January 28 had to wait more than half an hour to be handed over to A&E teams.

This is up from 32 per cent in the previous week and the joint highest so far this winter, as well as being nearly double the level at this point last year.

Some 15 per cent of patients had to wait more than an hour to be handed over last week, up from 14 per cent the previous week - again, the joint highest level this winter.

Last month The Independent revealed a row between medics and hospital leaders over cuts to overtime pay in the middle of winter.

Doctors warned actions which would discourage staff from working during the busy period would mean a risk to patient safety.

The Royal College of Emergency Medicine said this week that, 12 months on from the NHS urgent and emergency care plan, A&Es are still ""unsafe"". Figures show tens of thousands are still waiting more than 12 hours to be seen after arrival.

Several hospitals in the last two weeks have announced critical incidents over the increased winter pressures.

Earlier this week, figures from the Office for National Statistics showed in the last two weeks one in five adults could not keep comfortably warm a home and one in 25 reported their household had run out of food and could not afford to buy more.

Professor Julian Redhead, NHS England's national clinical director for urgent and emergency care, said: ""The NHS is still in the thick of a challenging winter with intensifying seasonal virus pressures as hospitals dealt with the highest number of patients with norovirus or flu so far this winter.

""Last week was evidence of why the NHS needed to grow its core bed numbers - with occupancy at its highest level this winter, fuelled by rising numbers of flu and norovirus admissions, and more than 13,000 patients remaining in hospital each day who are fit to be discharged because of ongoing capacity issues in social and community care- and NHS staff have worked tirelessly to boost capacity and execute key steps of the urgent and emergency care recovery plan.""","Weekly NHS England figures show an average of 2,226 patients were in hospital each day with the flu last week, up from 1,312 a month earlier and compared to 1,290 in the same week last year.

2024-02-01,Norway's most powerful storm in over 30 years leaves a trail of destruction,"{{ #verifyErrors }}{{ message }}{{ /verifyErrors }}{{ ^verifyErrors }}Something went wrong. Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

Residents of central Norway awoke to scenes of havoc and homes without power Thursday following the country's most powerful storm in more than three decades.

Hurricane-force winds hit parts of the Scandinavian country, with gusts of up 180 kilometers per hour (112 miles per hour). Near Laerdal, a small, picturesque town northeast of Bergen, Norway's second-largest city, a bus with 14 passengers was blown off a road, though no injuries were reported, police said.

Some areas were flooded, and airlines and ferry operators temporarily suspended service. There were scattered reports of closed schools, roads, tunnels and bridges both Wednesday and Thursday.

Hurricane-strength gusts also were reported overnight in Sweden. The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute issued a red warning for the western part of the Norrbottens district, which borders Norway.

The storm, named Ingunn by Norwegian meteorologists, landed in central Norway on Wednesday afternoon before moving north Thursday. The Meteorological Institute had issued a red warning, its highest alert, for the Arctic region.

Several windows were blown out of a hotel in Bodoe, a large town in the Nordland district, police said. Downtown Bodoe was later sealed off because ""there is a danger to life and health,"" according to police. University Hospital of North Norway said parts came loose from its roof antenna in Harstad, and photos in Norwegian media showed a helicopter landing pad littered with debris.

Bjørnar Gaasvik, a police spokesman in the Troendelag region, told Norwegian news agency NTB that the public safety agency received between 40 and 50 reports overnight from people affected by the storm and more were expected Thursday.

Sigmund Clementz of IF insurance told Norwegian newspaper VG that it was too early so estimate the cost of the storm damage.

South of there in Denmark, the Storebaelt bridge linking two major Danish islands, was closed to vehicles with lighter trailers because of strong winds.

The storm hit the same area as a 1992 New Year's hurricane, one of the strongest storms in Norway's history, the newspaper VG wrote.","Several windows blown out of a hotel in Bodoe, a large town in Nordland district.

2024-02-01,"Till the Stars Come Down is a crowd-pleasing comedy about a wedding gone awry, review","Beth Steel's play about a multigenerational family has a cheeky spirit but a tragic undercurrent, as its characters grapple with the simmering tensions of life in a post-Brexit community

A pair of elasticated Spanx pings into a near-hysterical audience in the first act of Beth Steel's zingy comedy, set at a small town Northern wedding where all decorum breaks down. It's typical of the cheeky spirit of this crowd-pleasing play - but peel off the layers and there's tragedy underneath. Steel also writes for TV, and accordingly Till the Stars Come Down has the energy of a big season finale, where a multigenerational cast clash, cry, and unearth secrets against the backdrop of an emotional family get-together. Sinead Matthews lends an emotive croak to the role of Sylvia, the nervy bride who wakes up nauseous, sure that her big day won't go to plan.

She's not wrong. Her family can't hide their mixed feelings about her Polish husband-to-be Marek (Marc Wootton). Her dad John (Derek Riddell) forgets his name in his after-dinner speech, protesting that he hardly knows him, while her sister Hazel (Lucy Black) makes snide comments about migrants taking the best jobs in their opportunity-starved former mining town. Their other sister, played by Lisa McGrillis, keeps quiet, while Aunty Carol is eagerly trying to trample her way into the role of Sylvia's deceased mother. Lorraine Ashbourne is a knockout in this gem of a comic role, prancing across the dancefloor and reminiscing cryptically about the time she wiped her bum with candyfloss (""it was pink"", she says in justification). It's all building to something, that much is obvious.

But when the obligatory wedding punch-up arrives, the blows land more heavily than you'd expect. This play niggles at the tensions in a post-Brexit community where there's not much to go round, but pride and apathy end up being almost as corrosive as decades of underfunding. As Marek, Wootton is broad and bumptious - perhaps having too much fun with the comic side of this penniless Megabus arrival-turned-successful local builder for the sadder realities of living with xenophobia to land. But Philip Whitchurch's more understated turn as Uncle Pete supplies more pathos, showcasing the flexibility of Steel's writing - difficult, even bigoted views get aired here but there's empathy and the capacity for change, too.",Beth Steel's play about a multigenerational family has a cheeky spirit but a tragic undercurrent.

2024-02-01,Alastair Cook: 'England have turned the tables on India with first Test masterclass',"{{ #verifyErrors }}{{ message }}{{ /verifyErrors }}{{ ^verifyErrors }}Something went wrong. Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

Playing Test cricket on the subcontinent is notoriously hard, one of the most difficult assignments in all of sport. Every element of the game is stacked against you, from the spinning pitches and stifling hot air to the intense, unrelenting atmosphere inside the ground.

Few know how to overcome it all like Sir Alastair Cook. He hit seven Test centuries in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan and India, including a majestic 190 in Kolkata in 2012, an innings at the heart of England's last Test series win in India, and India's last Test series defeat on home soil against anyone. So when he describes the first Test victory in Hyderabad as one of the best in English history, he means it. ""It is one of the greatest away wins, or any win,"" says Cook, who will be in the studio to analyse the second Test for TNT Sports.

The victory does a couple of things to this series, which was almost written off in some quarters as a case not of 'if' but of how badly England would be beaten.

First, it fills the English team with confidence in their own skills on Indian wickets, and they will need that faith when the going inevitably gets tough. ""When you play in the subcontinent it can be very overpowering,"" says Cook. ""If you get behind, the momentum is very hard to stop. Whenever we got behind, it was very hard to change it.""

Belief is a sporting cliche but it is an essential ingredient if England are to pull off what hasn't been done to India for more than a decade and win the series. The inexperience of England's bowlers might actually help. ""Because of their status in terms of the IPL, you can see [the Indian players] as demi-gods and treat them as demi-gods, and subconsciously that can play with your mind. But the guys who haven't played much out there just see, 'oh, they're normal cricketers - very good, but normal and can be beaten'.""

The second is the result's effect on India. The question before the series was whether England's Bazball approach would work, whether it would need fine-tuning, whether it would even be adopted by the end of the series after a battering. Instead, the ball is now in India's court.

When England attack, when the sweep becomes as devastatingly effective as it was in the hands of Pope on day three, how will India react? Do they hold their nerve and wait for the mistake, or do they blink and adapt their gameplan? In the first Test, captain Rohit Sharma often got caught in between and by the time he changed his tactics, the game was already getting away.

""They did look a little bit all at sea,"" says Cook. ""I think it shook them. When you're 200 runs ahead and you're so used to winning, [you think] 'oh, this won't happen much longer'. Rohit didn't change the field for a while because stats say when you play a high-risk shot against the world-class bowling of Jadeja, Ashwin and Patel, the odds are stacked in your favour.

""So tactically it's going to be intriguing to see whether England have forced India's hand and they become more defensive in their field placings, and therefore the traditional way of getting out against spin - caught bat-pad, caught silly point, playing defensively - England might have taken that away because India might have less men around the bat.""

Cook was in charge of a very different team when England visited India in 2012, in what was his first overseas tour as captain. There was no Bazball mentality, but England had Cook's commanding presence leading from the front, the once-in-a-generation talent of Kevin Pietersen in the middle order, and elite spinners in Graeme Swann and Monty Panesar who outbowled the Indians in their back yard.

England lost the first Test, but Peitersen produced a breathtaking 186 to win the second in Mumbai against the odds, and the momentum swung dramatically. Cook's 190 followed at Eden Gardens two weeks later and England never looked back, winning 3-1.

""It was quite an easy tour to captain,"" Cook says. ""Just throw the ball to Monty and Swanny, they'll do the job. If not, a bit of reverse swing from Jimmy [Anderson] and Finny [Steven Finn]. I was lucky to have experienced spinners.""

By contrast, England have a relatively callow attack, with debutant Tom Hartley - magnificent in Hyderabad - and Shoaib Bashir now making his debut in this second Test, replacing the injured Jack Leach. Cook was stunned by Hartley's seven-wicket haul in the second innings. ""England might have found a cricketer who is good under pressure, and that's ultimately what Test cricket is about."" James Anderson also comes in for the game in Visakhapatnam, which starts on Friday, replacing Mark Wood.

Cook played in Visakhapatnam in 2016 in a Test match England would rather forget, when Virat Kohli hit 167 en route to an utterly dominant victory. As it turns out, Cook has forgotten. ""To be totally honest, I can't remember it at all,"" he laughs. ""So I could start waffling on about it, but I couldn't even tell you what it looks like.""

The question was raised last summer about whether a young Cook would necessarily break into this England team, which brought a bold answer from Stokes. ""While I'm captain and Baz is coach, that is not something we're looking for,"" he said, when the hypothetical was put to him. ""We want players who will go out there and put pressure on the bowlers straightaway ... it's pretty obvious the sort of players we want.""

That was a strong statement about England's greatest runscorer, one which Cook doesn't entirely agree with. ""Stokesy can have the other [players], it's fine, I'll sit and watch him,"" he smiles. ""Ultimately, volume of runs makes a big, big impact. If you go back to when I first started as a 21-year-old, I scored quite a lot of runs to force my way in and if a 20, 21-year-old does that, the selectors will definitely look at him.""

That was the case for Zak Crawley, now established as an opening batter who sets the tone. Like Cook, Crawley also admitted he didn't know anything about the venue to the media this week, but reports from the England camp suggest slightly damper conditions and there could be some joy for Anderson.

Cook is more concerned about the one thing England grabbed and never let go of 11 years ago, momentum. A fast start to the second Test is key. ""If England start well and score quickly again, it will really be interesting to see how India cope with that. If England can somehow get ahead of the eight-ball in the game, I think India will find it really hard.""",England beat India 3-1 in the first Test in Hyderabad in 2012.

2024-02-01,Interest rates remain frozen at 15-year high as Bank of England tackles inflation,"{{ #verifyErrors }}{{ message }}{{ /verifyErrors }}{{ ^verifyErrors }}Something went wrong. Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

Interest rates remain frozen for the fourth time in a row as hawkish officials continue trying to flush above-target inflation out of the economy.

Bank of England policy chiefs on Thursday voted to keep the base rate at a 15-year high of 5.25 per cent despite inflation trending downwards.

Inflation has been gradually decreasing in recent months but remains above the Bank's target of 2 per cent. In its latest update on Thursday, the Bank also said it now expects inflation to temporarily return to below 2 per cent by the summer.

Officials at the UK central bank were accused by some of acting too slowly to tackle inflation when it spiralled into double-digit figures in 2022 and so will be keen to ensure the danger has passed before cutting rates.

Interest rates determine how high the cost of borrowing money is, or how high the rewards of saving are. They can also impact the cost of mortgages, which have begun to come down recently after soaring in response to the hike in interest rates, with city analysts expecting cuts to the base rate later this year.

The Bank's latest decision on interest rates comes after inflation unexpectedly ticked up slightly to 4 per cent in December, from 3.9 per cent in November, driven by rising tobacco and alcohol prices.

Although inflation increased slightly it has been trending downwards for months and remains well below the 11.1 per cent peak recorded in October 2022.

Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs said it expects the Bank to start cutting the base rate from 5.25 per cent from May - meaning a quicker-than-expected fall in borrowing costs.

Some economists predict the rate could fall as low as 3 per cent by the end of 2024, driving optimism in the market.",Bank of England policy chiefs on Thursday voted to keep the base rate at a 15-year high of 5.25 per cent despite inflation trending downwards.

2024-02-01,Three killed and nine injured in horror hangar collapse at Boise Airport,"Three people have been killed and nine injured after a hangar under construction at Boise Airport collapsed.

Authorities responded to a ""catastrophic collapse"" at around 5pm on Wednesday at a privately owned steel-framed hanger, Boise Fire Department Operations Chief Aaron Hummel said in a news briefing, according to AP.

As of Wednesday evening, everyone who had been at the site had been accounted for, Mr Hummel added.

Three people died at the scene, and five of those who were injured are in critical condition, the city said in a statement on Wednesday night, the outlet said.

Fire crews worked to stabilise the scene and were able to rescue multiple victims, the statement added.

""It was a very chaotic scene,"" Mr Hummel said. ""I don't know what caused it, but I can tell you it was a pretty global collapse,"" he said.

He added that some of the victims were on a hoist or other elevated platforms when the structure collapsed, meaning some specialised rescue efforts were needed.

A crane also fell during the incident, Mr Hummell added.

Emergency and trauma teams were also at the scene with first responders to treat the victims, Leticia Ramirez, a spokesperson for Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center in Boise, said, according to the outlet.

Operations at Boise Airport have not been impacted, officials said, according to the outlet.

2024-02-01,Richard III actor vows not to 'alter physicality' amid disability casting row,"The artistic director of Shakespeare's Globe has confirmed she will play Richard III in a new summer production as originally planned amid a furious row over the casting decision.

While Olivier-winner Michelle Terry vowed not to ""alter my physicality"" for her depiction of the monarch, she added that the part would not be recast following backlash from disability advocacy groups in a statement on Wednesday (31 January).

The Globe was criticised after it announced Terry, a non-disabled actor, would play the role of Shakespeare's ""deformed, unfinish'd"" king. More than 100 disabled performers argued that the part of the ""most iconic disabled character"" in literature should go to a disabled actor because ""this part belongs to us"".

The Disabled Artists Alliance put forward their concerns in an open letter addressed to the British theatre, explaining its members were ""outraged and disappointed"" by the decision.

""It is offensive and distasteful for Richard to be portrayed by someone outside the community. It reduces disability down to a disguise and physical act, rather than a true grounded understanding of what disability means,"" their letter read.

In response, the theatre released a statement on Wednesday confirming the play will run from 9 May to 3 August, as per their original plans, adding that they'd continue to ""be in dialogue with our artistic communities"" about the summer production.

Meanwhile, Terry, 45, apologised for ""any pain or harm"" caused by the casting in the theatre's statement, while reiterating that all casting decisions are ""made as consciously and rigorously"" as possible.

""We have questions about the character of Richard. What is Shakespeare doing with the character of Richard and his self-titled 'deformity',"" the statement read.

""We know that Shakespeare was writing in a particular time; leaning on, amplifying, and sometimes exaggerating the early modern belief that a 'deformed' body meant a 'deformed' soul.""

However, Terry confirmed that she would not portray Richard III's disability with her body, while acknowledging the significance of the character as an ""iconic disabled figure"" for many people.

""I will not alter my physicality to explore it,"" she wrote. ""I will not be playing Richard with a visible or physical impairment, and we will frame this production in such a way as to make it very clear the lens through which this interpretation is being explored.

""This production does not equal a permanent revision of the play or the eternal erasure of the character's impairment, or a rewriting of a historical figure. I acknowledge that for many, Richard III is an iconic disabled figure.

""I understand that this feels like a missed opportunity for a disabled artist to play a disabled character on a major UK stage, but it will come around again,"" she continued. ""We will continue to find as many ways as possible to diversify opportunity, to use the plays as a site for research, education, and discourse.""

Since being named the Globe's artistic director in April 2018, Terry has played several famous Shakespearean characters, including Hamlet and Cordelia in King Lear.","Michelle Terry will play Richard III in a new summer production of Shakespeare's Globe.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have called for urgent change to child safety on social media, saying the ""best parenting in the world cannot keep children safe from these platforms"".

Harry and Meghan spoke out after the chief executives of Meta, TikTok, X and other social media giants gave evidence before the US Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, in front of parents whose children suffered or died because of online harm.

In a statement on their Archewell website, the couple said the issue transcended division and party lines and this is ""not the time to pass the buck of responsibility"".

Harry and Meghan, who have been outspoken critics of the way social media firms handle child safety, said: ""We applaud the bravery and determination of the thousands of parents around the country whose advocacy resulted in this hearing.

""Over the past few years we have spent time with many of these families, listening to their heartache and their hopes for the urgent change that is needed in the online space.

""This is an issue that transcends division and party lines, as we saw today at the Senate hearing. The best parenting in the world cannot keep children safe from these platforms.""

They added: ""As one of the fathers shared with us: 'If love could have saved them, all of our children would still be here'.

""This is not the time to pass the buck of responsibility. It's the time to make necessary change at the source to keep our children safe.""

The statement was accompanied by a video of the couple at the Archewell Foundation Parents' Summit, which focused on mental wellness in a digital age, in New York in October last year to mark World Mental Health Day.

They were seen speaking to and hugging parents who shared their experiences.

Meghan said: ""When the car was first invented, there wasn't a seatbelt. And what happened? People started to get hurt, people started to die. So you started to change the car.""

She added: ""Everyone now is affected by the online world and social media. There was an entry point that's positive in creating community, but we all just want to feel safe.""

The duke urged tech bosses to ""stop sending children content you wouldn't want your own children to see"".

""We need to get out of this idea that young kids, there's something wrong with them. No, it's the world that we're allowing to be created around them,"" he said.

""Please stop sending children content that you wouldn't want your own children to see.""

The Archewell Foundation said it is working with families to provide a support network for those dealing with grief or those whose children have serious mental health conditions as a result of their exposure to harmful online content.

During the Congressional hearing on Wednesday, Republican senator Lindsey Graham told Mr Zuckerberg and other social media bosses: ""I know you don't mean it to be so, but you have blood on your hands. You have a product that's killing people.""

Mr Zuckerberg stood up at one point to address dozens of parents in the audience, some of whom held up pictures of teenagers who killed themselves following abuse on social media.

He told them: ""I'm sorry for everything you have all been through.""

The Sussexes' public statement comes at a time when the King and the Prince and Princess of Wales are all away from official engagements, as Charles recovers from treatment on an enlarged prostate and William cares for Kate as she recuperates from abdominal surgery.","Duke and Duchess of Sussex call for urgent change to child safety on social media. they spoke out after chief executives of Meta, TikTok, X gave evidence before US Senate.

2024-02-01,Curtis Jones: My time has come to play a significant role for Liverpool,"Jones, who turned 23 on Tuesday, made his senior debut in January 2019 but his breakthrough did not come until the following campaign.

Since then he has been gaining experience and - after a testing time last year because of injury - he is enjoying his best goalscoring season, having taken his tally to five with a goal in last weekend's FA Cup victory over Norwich.

Manager Jurgen Klopp's faith in the Toxteth-born academy graduate has not wavered and Jones responded with another good performance in the 4-1 win over Chelsea which extended their lead at the top of the Premier League to five points.

""It's the most I'm enjoying it, I'd say,"" Jones told TNT Sports.

""It's been up and down for the whole time, I'd say - I had the injuries and stuff. It's the first time when I've come in the team and I'm enjoying it, I'm playing free, I'm scoring goals and helping the team, so, I'm happy.

""I came around the team when I was 17 and it wasn't an easy thing, but he (Klopp) was calling me in all the time and we were having chats. He was always saying, 'Your time will come'.

""I'm at the point now where my time has come and I'm taking my chance. I had to adapt my game a lot. That's what I've done now.""

Jones' contribution this season has been particularly important with injuries to Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai, plus the Asian Cup absence of Wataru Endo, meaning midfield resources have often been stretched.

But having come through January unscathed, the club are still challenging for four trophies and even before news of Klopp's pending departure emerged, Jones believes they were set up for something special after a summer rebuild of their midfield.

""The team has got this buzz about us. It's a new team, it's a young team, it's a fresh team,"" he added.

""Of course there's been a change in terms of how we play and the lads that have come in.

""Normally it takes a bit of time to adapt but the lads have just adapted quickly, they've come in, played their part.

""It's just not individuals, like Mo (Salah) scoring all the goals. The likes of me are going to help, Dom's going to help, Conor (Bradley) is going to help, Trent (Alexander-Arnold) as always. It's passing through the whole of the team.""

The demolition of Chelsea highlighted the focus of the Liverpool players has so far not been distracted by Klopp's announcement he is quitting and the manager is delighted by that.

""Attitude is not our problem, attitude is something we can expect. Attitude is created by the culture. Attitude is created by the crowd,"" said the German.

""Attitude is created by pretty much everybody around the team. Attitude will not be the issue of this team.""",Jurgen Klopp's side beat Chelsea 4-1 in the FA Cup on saturday.

With the new campaign only three weeks away it would mark a shocking way to start F1 in 2024, while also sparking what could be a long period of speculation over who would take Hamilton's seat at Mercedes.

It's over two years since the Brit has won an F1 race as the Silver Arrows have struggled to keep pace with Red Bull's designs and drivers. During the close season he has moved to bring Marc Hynes back into his support team for the new campaign, while Ferrari have themselves appointed another Brit, Ollie Bearman, as their reserve driver for the year.","Lewis Hamilton is set to leave Mercedes for Ferrari in 2025.

The 20-year-old had been demonstrating outside the InterContinental Hotel in Mayfair on 17 October, as leading oil executives attended an annual summit.

On Thursday, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard she was given a final warning by two Metropolitan Police officers, but allegedly refused to move towards the designated protest area and said she was ""staying where she was"".

She joined two Fossil Free London (FFL) protesters and two Greenpeace activists who have also pleaded not guilty to breaching Section 14 of the Public Order Act 1986.

The Swedish national blockedHamilton Place, near Park Lane, on the first day of the Energy Intelligence Forum, where bosses of Shell and Total were due to speak, the trial heard.

Formerly known as the Oil and Money conference, a number of senior CEOs, businessmen and political figures were in attendance to discuss sustainable solutions to world energy challenges.

At around 7.15am, a number of activists descended on the scene and began to block the hotel entrances and security exits. By 10.23am, protesters had gained access to the roof of the building and were slowly abseiling down, while a vehicle entrance was also blocked by midday.

Superintendent Matt Cox, who was in charge of policing on the day, told the court: ""Essentially the delegates weren't able to get in and out of the hotel, it was relayed from security that people weren't able to get out of the hotel. People were really restricted on how they could access the hotel.""

The Met Police said that a number of protesters had failed to comply with requests to leave the road, and were subsequently arrested.

Pictures showed activists carrying banners and pink umbrellas, while others lit pink and yellow flares.

The Metropolitan Police had imposed conditions on the 17 October protest under Section 14 of the Public Order Act to ""prevent serious disruption to the community, hotel and guests"". A further 21 people who took part in the same demonstration, including supporters of Extinction Rebellion, are also due to appear on later court dates.

2024-02-01,Malaysia man's stunt of planting banana tree in pothole gets road repaired in hours,"{{ #verifyErrors }}{{ message }}{{ /verifyErrors }}{{ ^verifyErrors }}Something went wrong. Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

Frustrated over the authority's inaction, a Malaysian man planted a banana tree in a pothole on a road to draw attention to the problem.

Mahathir Aripin from Jalan Sandakan-Lahad Datu village in Sabah posted a photo of the banana tree standing almost in the middle of the road on his Facebook page.

The base of the tree was covered with some soil to ensure it stood erect.

He also posted a message expressing his concern for those using the road and humorously suggested he might use tar next time.

""I feel sorry for the road users. I'll cover it with tar next time,"" he said on 29 January.

Seeing the response to his Facebook post, the local authorities responsible for road safety - the Sabah Public Works Department - started work to repair the road.

Reports said the pothole was filled within hours of Mr Aripin bringing attention to it.

The public works department blamed continuous rain as a reason for delay in the road maintenance.

This method of highlighting road repair issues is not unprecedented. There have been cases reported in Kedah in the country, and even in Florida, US.

Mr Aripin's post sparked a conversation on road conditions in Malaysia.

On social media, several commentators commended his effort to bring attention to the problem of road safety and maintenance.

One jokingly said that he should have planted a durian tree whose fruit is notoriously foul-smelling instead of a banana tree.

Others responded with the laughter emoji while some called his attempt to plant a banana tree in the pothole ""naughty"".

The pothole's location was about 500m from the spot where a recent accident claimed the life of a 4-year-old girl, believed to have been caused by a pothole.

According to Malaysia's Road Safety Plan 2022-2030, the country aims to reduce road deaths by 50 per cent by 2030.",Mahathir Aripin from Sabah posted a photo of the banana tree on his Facebook page.

2024-02-01,Dire Straits frontman Mark Knopfler's guitars sell for more than £8m at auction,"Dire Straits star Mark Knopfler has auctioned off more than 120 of his guitars and amps for a total of more than £8m.

The frontman of the British rock band offered a selection of his instruments spanning his 50-year career at Christie's Auction House, with 25 per cent of the total price divided equally between charities The British Red Cross, Tusk and Brave Hearts of the North East.

Auction house Christie's will also donate £50,000 to each of the four charities.

""This auction has been an incredible journey, and I am so pleased that these much-loved instruments will find new players and new songs as well as raising money for charities that mean a lot to me,"" Knopfler said.

""It has been heart-warming to witness how much these guitars mean to so many people and I am also pleased that they will continue to give joy to many through the songs recorded over the years with me.

""To you fellow players, enthusiasts and collectors, I wish you all good things.""

The London auction saw registered bidders and buyers from 61 countries, with a final total including buyer's premium, confirmed at £8,840,160.

The sale was led by Knopfler's 1959 Vintage Gibson Les Paul Standard which sold for £693,000, setting a new world auction record for the model.

Other auction world records were set by the 1988 Pensa-Suhr MK-1, which Knopfler played at Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday tribute concert at Wembley Stadium, selling for £504,000.

While the Red Schecter Telecaster, which Knopfler purchased in 1984 to record hit Dire Straits song Walk Of Life, went under the hammer for £415,800 setting another record for the model.

2024-02-01,Nottingham Forest sign Rodrigo Ribeiro as Mahmoud Dahoud leaves Brighton on loan,"Nottingham Forest and Brighton made early moves in an otherwise sedate start to transfer deadline day.

Forest have been one of the most active clubs in the transfer market in recent times and continued that trend with the signing of Rodrigo Ribeiro from Sporting Lisbon.

The 18-year-old striker has joined on loan until the end of the season in a deal which could become permanent.

Ribeiro came through the ranks in Lisbon and made his professional debut for the club as a late substitute in a Champions League tie against Manchester City in March 2022.

There was an exit rather than an arrival at Brighton, with midfielder Mahmoud Dahoud moving to Stuttgart on loan until the end of the season.

The 28-year-old German joined Albion in June last year from Borussia Dortmund and returns to the Bundesliga after making 14 appearances in all competitions for the club.

Technical director David Weir said: ""This is a good move for Mahmoud. It will give him an opportunity to play regularly for a side doing very well towards the top of the Bundesliga. We wish him well for the rest of the campaign.""

In the Sky Bet Championship, midfielder Alex Pritchard completed his move from Sunderland to Birmingham for an undisclosed fee.

The 30-year-old has signed a two-and-a-half-year contract to reunite with former Black Cats boss Tony Mowbray.

""I am happy,"" Pritchard told BluesTV.

""My future has been well speculated for a while now and I am just glad to get everything done and just settled and, hopefully, I can just crack on with football.""

Sunderland reacted quickly to fill the gap in their squad, signing winger Romaine Mundle from Standard Liege for an undisclosed fee.

The 20-year-old former Tottenham player has signed a four-and-a-half-year contract at the Stadium of Light.

Sunderland's sporting director Kristjaan Speakman said: ""Talented players like Romaine are highly sought after and we saw this first hand in the summer when he left Tottenham Hotspur.

""We didn't anticipate him being available on a permanent basis, but when we sensed an opportunity, we moved quickly and decisively to make it happen - our ways of working and structure are a real strength in these moments.""

Sunderland face Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium on Sunday but the home side will be without Morgan Rogers after the forward joined Aston Villa for an undisclosed fee.

Dundee have completed the cinch Premiership's first signing of transfer deadline day by taking Norwich goalkeeper Jon McCracken back to Dens Park on loan.

McCracken made four appearances for Dundee at the start of the season but lost his place when Trevor Carson joined from St Mirren and both parties agreed to terminate the loan deal in August.

The 23-year-old went on to join Accrington on an emergency loan and played 13 times and now cannot play for anyone else this season other than Dundee.

With Carson missing some recent games through injury, manager Tony Docherty told his club's website: ""It is important for me to have strong competition in every position for the last part of the season and I want that with our goalkeepers and bringing Jon in gives us a real level of competition.""

Celtic are set to wrap up the loan signing of Norwich striker Adam Idah after the 22-year-old arrived in Glasgow on Wednesday.

The Republic of Ireland international has scored 17 goals since graduating from the Canaries academy, with seven of them coming this season.

Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers is also keen to add a left-back as Greg Taylor is out injured, with 31-year-old Paris St Germain player Layvin Kurzawa mooted as a possibility.

Midfielder David Turnbull, who is out of contract at the end of the season, has been linked with a £2million move to Cardiff, while Gustaf Lagerbielke's proposed loan move to Italian side Lecce could be scuppered amid reports of further injury concerns over his fellow centre-back Cameron Carter-Vickers.

There could be big news at Rangers amid reports from Italy that Hellas Verona are set to launch a bid to sign striker Cyriel Dessers.

Rangers are expected to complete the signing of 20-year-old Colombian winger Oscar Cortes on loan from Lens with an option to buy after he arrived in Glasgow.

However, the Ibrox club look to have been thwarted in their bid to land Brazilian left-back Jefte from Fluminense. The Gers hoped to recruit the 20-year-old immediately, but he is currently on loan with APOEL Nicosia and the Cypriot club are reportedly intent on keeping him until the end of the campaign.

Motherwell are still looking for at least one further addition after signing 22-year-old Welsh forward Jack Vale on loan from Blackburn on Wednesday, and assistant manager Stephen Frail gave fans fresh hope there might be a loan return for Groningen striker Kevin van Veen.

""I'm not sure anything's out the water,"" Frail said on Thursday morning. ""That could be one of those last-minute things.

""There will be one or two people that the manager and recruitment team are looking to bring in. Any developments will maybe be last minute or later in the day.""

Aberdeen are said to have had a bid rejected in an effort to re-sign Mattie Pollock on loan from Watford, a day after Barry Robson was sacked as manager.

Hearts forward Lawrence Shankland has been the subject of intense speculation in recent months, but the Jambos go into the final day of the window without any notable approaches having been made for their top scorer.

The Edinburgh club signed Scott Fraser on Wednesday, but it looks unlikely that they will secure Yan Dhanda before the deadline after the Ross County playmaker agreed a pre-contract to move to Tynecastle in the summer.

Staggies boss Derek Adams said on Tuesday he expects the 25-year-old to remain in Dingwall for the rest of the season, while he hopes to add at least one or possibly two new players.

St Johnstone are reportedly hoping to land 25-year-old striker Adama Sidibeh from English non-league side Warrington Rylands.

Livingston boss David Martindale hopes to sign a new centre-back as well as Inverness midfielder David Carson, while Hibernian are another club in the market for a central defender.

Kilmarnock manager Derek McInnes said on Wednesday ""we may still look to add one if we can"", while his St Mirren counterpart Stephen Robinson is happy with the make-up of his squad and not planning for much deadline-day business.

2024-02-01,Rachel Reeves defends decision to allow unlimited bonuses for bankers,"Labour's holder of the purse strings said on Thursday she had heard the calls from company bosses to end the ""chopping and changing"" seen under the Government.

She has faced some criticism for ruling out bringing back the cap on bonuses introduced in the wake of the 2008 financial crash after it was axed by the Conservatives.

Ms Reeves upped Labour's ""pro-business"" pitch during a speech to company bosses by committing not to hike corporation tax during a first term in power.

""The truth is that in financial services there are a lot more rules and regulations and safeguards in place than there were before the financial crisis, for example banks have to put aside much more capital than they did before 2008,"" she replied to reporters.

""And there are much stronger rules about clawing back bankers' bonuses. So we didn't think it was the right priority, it wouldn't have been my number one priority in that budget.

""But the chopping and changing has got to end if we're going to give stability to business and that's why we will not be bringing that back.""

The appeal to the party's business conference in London marked another shift from Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, with him having labelled the financial sector ""speculators and gamblers who crashed our economy"".

The cap limited annual payouts to twice a banker's salary.

But it was scrapped last year after a decision was made in Liz Truss's brief spell in No 10 by her chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng.","Labour's holder of the purse strings says she has heard calls from company bosses.

An aviation firm supplying ""critical"" air ambulance services across the South of England has been saved from administration.

The firm, Specialist Aviation Service, which is based at Gloucestershire Airport, supported more than 5,000 ambulance flights in 2023.

It provided helicopters and pilots for air ambulance services that cover Dorset and Somerset, Kent, Surrey and Sussex, Essex and Hearts, East of England and London.

The company had sustained operating losses for several years and needed to seek new funding.

It hired administrators from advisory firm FRP on Wednesday after failing to secure solvent sales.

On Thursday, its assets were sold to Gama Aviation, an aviation specialist headquartered in Farnborough, Hampshire.

Out of the company's 184 employees, all of them except for two will be transferring to Gama Aviation as part of the deal.

Andrew Sheridan, partner at FRP and joint administrator of Specialist Aviation Services, said: ""This was a complex transaction, in the heavily regulated aviation sector, and key parties included aircraft financiers, global OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), overseas government contracts and of course the air ambulance charities.

""Without the support of the CAA (Civil Aviation Authority) who mobilised a senior team and worked at speed, this transaction could not have happened and we wish to extend our gratitude to them, as well as to the Company's senior management team.

""The goal from the outset of our involvement was to ensure that the vital air ambulance operations continued without disruption, which they did.

""We take great satisfaction in ensuring that lives continued to be saved throughout the process and wish Gama and its newly acquired operations, highly skilled operatives and pilots, every success in the future.""

This comes as the number of company insolvencies hit a 30-year high in 2023 as firms suffered amid high-interest rates and cost pressures.

2024-02-01,Donald Trump's court claim over dossier alleging 'sexual perversions' dismissed,"{{ #verifyErrors }}{{ message }}{{ /verifyErrors }}{{ ^verifyErrors }}Something went wrong. Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

Donald Trump's data protection claim over allegations he took part in ""perverted"" sex acts and gave bribes to Russian officials has been dismissed by a High Court judge.

The former US president, 77, brought legal action against Orbis Business Intelligence, a consultancy founded by former MI6 officer Christopher Steele, and sought compensation for distress.

Mr Steele, who previously ran the Secret Intelligence Service's Russia desk, was the author of the so-called Steele dossier which included denied allegations Mr Trump had been ""compromised"" by the Russian security service, the FSB.

At a hearing in London last year, the court was told Mr Trump was bringing his case over two memos in the dossier which claimed he had taken part in ""sex parties"" while in St Petersburg and engaged in ""golden showers"" with prostitutes in Moscow.

But lawyers for Orbis asked for Mr Trump's claim to be thrown out, telling the court it was ""brought for the purpose of harassing Orbis and Mr Steele and pursuing longstanding grievances"".

In a judgment on Thursday, Mrs Justice Steyn said: ""In my view, there are no compelling reasons to allow the claim to proceed to trial in circumstances where, whatever the merits of the allegation that the personal data are inaccurate may be, the claim for compensation and/or damages... is bound to fail.""

""In reality, the claimant is seeking court findings to vindicate his reputation in circumstances where has not been able to formulate any viable remedy which he would have a real prospect of obtaining, or which would itself be of any utility; and having chosen to allow many years to elapse - without any attempt to vindicate his reputation in this jurisdiction - since he was first made aware of the dossier, including the memoranda, on 6 January 2017.""

The dossier, made up of more than a dozen memos, was produced by Orbis in 2016 ahead of the US election which saw Mr Trump become president before it was leaked to and published by BuzzFeed in 2017.

Hugh Tomlinson KC, for Mr Trump, described the allegations in the memos - which also included a claim the 77-year-old had ""defiled"" a bed previously used by former president Barack Obama and his wife - as ""egregiously inaccurate"".

Dismissing the claim, Mrs Justice Steyn said that the ""mere fact"" that Orbis had held copies of the memos could not cause Mr Trump distress.

""Mere storage of the memoranda by the defendant cannot sensibly be said to have had any impact on the claimant - if he was even aware of it - not least in circumstances where the memoranda are on the internet,"" the judge added.

During the hearing, Antony White KC, for the consultancy, said the case had been brought to pursue a ""vendetta"" against Orbis and the former MI6 officer.

He said: ""The claimant has a deep and intense animus against Mr Steele and Orbis, which is reflected in numerous vituperative public statements which he has made since the dossier was made public by BuzzFeed in 2017.""

Mr White added that Mr Trump ""has a long history of repeatedly bringing frivolous, meritless and vexatious claims for the purpose of vexing and harassing perceived enemies and others against whom he bears a grudge"".","Donald Trump brought legal action against Orbis Business Intelligence, a consultancy founded by former MI6 officer Christopher Steele.

2024-02-01,Moment French farmers overturn pepper truck as they vow to 'starve' Paris,"Footage from 26 January shows boxes of peppers strewn across the road with sections on fire, and a tractor approaching the truck and attempting to overturn it.

Farmers cheer as the tractor hoists the truck up before it reverses and moves towards it again, this time flipping it completely onto its side.

Across the nation, farmers continue to protest against inadequate wages, declining income, and environmental regulations and policies that are pushing up costs in France and across Europe.","Across the nation, farmers continue to protest against inadequate wages, declining income.

2024-02-01,"Apple wants you to pay £3,000 to look like a PS2 character","When Apple unveiled its first mixed reality headset to great fanfare last year, it had lofty visions of how early adopters would put it to use.

From stepping into virtual worlds and immersive cinema, to the next generation of phone calls and browsing the internet, this was to be a new era in technology.

It wasn't meant to be a protective mask while chopping onions, or the butt of internet memes.

The headset, selling for a cool $3,499 (£3,000) in the US (the UK release will probably be in the spring), will start dropping into shoppers' hands tomorrow, but tech reviewers who've already got their hands on a pair have been sharing their experiences.

And people have thoughts - mostly about the avatars, which are straight out of uncanny valley.

In an almost ghostly-like form (with blurred edges and everything) users are given a 'persona', where this video game-looking avatar can blend in with the physical environment, but appear as a floating being.

Creepy.

On X, user Sid said: 'Imagine spending $3,499 on an Apple Vision Pro only for it to make you look like a video game character from a decade ago in FaceTime calls.'

Also in the firing line, the eyes projected onto the external screen, so others can make a weird form of digital eye contact. It seems they don't quite look as expected after seeing the previews last year.

Wall Street Journal technology reporter Joanna Stern was impressed overall, noting that she didn't puke (VR headsets can often trigger motion sickness) and got a lot of work done.

But she also found the headset allowed her to cut onions without crying (the dream, albeit at huge cost), exclaiming 'I could cut onions all day in this. My eyes do not burn.'

However, the product does warn it's not recommended to prepare food while wearing them.

And she said her animated avatar would 'haunt your dreams'.

It seems the Vision Pro's main selling point for having a huge pair of goggles on your face is that it'll be helpful and you won't be isolated from the real world.

But making this experience not totally virtual also means users are dropped into an almost surreal world of mixed media, where things are slightly useful but sometimes not entirely necessary.

X users also showed how the Vision Pro could aid in vacuuming, by highlighting areas you haven't already hoovered - rather a waste of £3,000.

However, Apple is known for its revolutionary products and drive to change the tech landscape.

The cycloptic headgear will also allow streaming apps like Disney Plus, Max, Paramount Plus, Peacock, and others for a more immersive experience when watching TV.

For work, it seems like the device may be revolutionary, with 3D interfacing to allow users to share objects and 3D files - but this would mean having the product on your face for hours at a time.

The product is packed with cutting-edge technology and is built to be lightweight yet reporters like Nilay Patel, of the Verge called it; 'an iPad for your face'.

To be fair, no one likes change, and this is a big one.

But there was a time when people thought it was pointless putting cameras in phones. Look how that did.","Apple unveiled its first mixed reality headset to great fanfare last year.

2024-02-01,Putin doubles down on claims that Russian jet was downed by US missiles,"The Russian president said on Wednesday that Ukraine used a US Patriot missile defence system to shoot down the transport plane over the border city Belgorod.

'The expert analysis has already established that. We insist that an international investigation be carried out. No international organisations are willing to do this,' he said.

Putin said that Ukraine had fired two missiles at the plane, resulting in a fireball in the sky.

Footage broadcast on Russian TV shows investigators at the scene of the disaster that took place last week.

Several charred fragments with English writing on them - said to be the remains of the US missile - were paraded on screen.

Ukraine and Russia traded the blame over the explosion and the crash, which was captured on a video.

But Putin took it a step further, stressing that Ukraine used a US weapon to attack the plane.

The Kremlin also alleged that the crash killed all 74 people onboard, including the 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war (PoWs) heading for a swap.

The culprit for the downing, the Russian Defence Ministry said, was Ukraine itself.

Ukraine has neither confirmed nor denied that it shot down the aircraft, and has demanded proof of who was on board.

But a Ukrainian military spy official said on Tuesday that Russia has been showing no willingness to return the bodies.

Spokesperson Andriy Yusov was quoted as saying by Suspilne broadcaster: 'It's a statement from Russia that our prisoners were there, and so far we can analyse only their words.

'Now there is no readiness to transfer the bodies from the other side.'","Putin said that Ukraine had fired two missiles at the plane, resulting in a fireball in the sky.

2024-02-01,Map reveals areas with highest rates of STIs in London,"New figures show Lambeth, Southwark, Hackney, Westminster and Islington have the highest overall rates of sexually transmitted infections in the country - with transmissions in Lambeth and Southwark five times the national average.

The data from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) found Lambeth has the highest rates of both gonorrhoea and syphilis in England.

Professor Sir Chris Whitte, England's chief medical officer, told a Women and Equalities Committee panel last week that gonorrhorea is 'the infection where the biggest worry is'.

He added: 'Gonorrhoea is, in the UK and internationally, one of the most highly drug-resistant organisms we have.

'So we're down to a very limited number of antibiotics now which can be used - previously we'd have had a much wider range.

'Fortunately, this hasn't translated into drug resistance for most of the other antibiotic-treatable sexually transmitted infections, at least not to this level.

'But if we are really in deep trouble at the moment we do need some new antibiotics or some new way of approaching.'

Lambeth, Hackney and Southwark have the highest rates of chlamydia, while Southwark has the highest rate of herpes.

And Brent and Lambeth have the lowest levels of coverage for the HPV vaccine among 12-13-year-olds. The virus can cause genital warts and cervical as well as other forms of cancer.

While we have included the City of London in the map above, we haven't included it within this analysis as the borough has a small population and therefore a disproportionately high STI rate.

Last week, experts revealed sexual health services are being forced to ration the number of free condoms they give out as they come 'very close to a crisis'.

And the Local Government Association warned that transmission rates would keep rising without extra funding - as public health grants to councils have reduced by £880 million despite increasing demand.","Lambeth has the highest rates of both gonorrhoea and syphilis in England.

2024-02-01,Jude Bellingham's career timeline from boy wonder to global superstar,"Real Madrid and England star Jude Bellingham has blossomed into one of the finest players in the beautiful game.

But that will come as no surprise to former clubs Birmingham City and Borussia Dortmund, who have helped nurture his talent on his footballing journey to the top of the game.

The 20 year-old, who will be hoping to fire the Three Lions to glory at Euro 2024 this summer, has enjoyed an historic start to his Madrid career in-keeping with a player who has broken record after record since his first steps in senior football over four years ago.

Let's take a look at Bellingham's club career and his defining moments to date.

Bellingham joined Birmingham's academy as part of the U8 team, eventually progressing to play for the U23s by the age of just 15.

The midfielder became the club's youngest-ever player when he made his first-team debut, aged 16 years and 38 days, in a Carabao Cup clash with Portsmouth in August 2019.

His winning strike against Stoke at the end of that month then saw him become Birmingham's youngest-ever goalscorer.

From that point onwards, Bellingham became a mainstay in the starting XI, and his performances for his boyhood club saw him linked with a whole host of big name teams in the January 2020 transfer window.

One of the clubs circling around the starlet was Manchester United, who reportedly had a £20m bid turned down for the player on deadline day.

Bellingham's first, and ultimately only season with Birmingham, saw him finish the campaign with four goals in 44 appearances in all competitions.

After Bellingham left the club to join Borussia Dortmund, Birmingham decided to retire the number 22 shirt in honour of their academy graduate.

Announcing the move, Birmingham said: 'In such a remarkably short space of time Jude has become an iconic figure at Blues, showing what can be achieved through talent, hard work and dedication. His caring, humble and engaging off-the-field demeanour has also made him such an impressive role model.

'The 22 shirt has become synonymous with Jude, his rise to the first team aged just 16 years and 38 days and these qualities. And as such the club have decided it would be fitting to retire this number, to remember one of our own and to inspire others.'

Dortmund were reportedly one of several clubs that Bellingham and his father, Mark, visited in the summer of 2020, with the German side's impressive record of developing younger players said to have been a key factor in their decision to opt for the Signal Iduna Park.

Dortmund parted with £25m to sign Bellingham, making him the most expensive 17 year-old in the history of the sport.

Another record fell the way of Bellingham when, just thirty minutes into his debut, he became the youngest-ever Dortmund goalscorer at 17 years and 77 days.

But the records didn't stop there, with his Champions League debut in October seeing him break Phil Foden's record for the youngest English player to feature in the competition.

His goal in the Champions League quarter-final second leg against Manchester City made him Dortmund and England's youngest scorer in the competition.

Growing in influence as the season went on, Bellingham's campaign culminated with a start in the DFB-Pokal final against RB Leipzig, which Dortmund won 4-1 to hand Bellingham his first trophy.

Finishing his debut season in Germany with four goals in 46 appearances in all competitions, Bellingham was voted Newcomer of the Season by his teammates and was the runner-up to Barcelona star Pedri in the 2021 Kopa Trophy.

Underling his stature in the team, Bellingham was handed the armband for a Champions League group stage fixture against Sevilla in October 2022, becoming the third youngest player ever to do so.

Bellingham finished his second season with the German giants with six goals and 14 assists as the club finished eight points behind champions Bayern Munich.

Dortmund agonisingly missed out on the title to Bayern on the final day of the 2022/23 season after drawing at home to Mainz - a game which Bellingham was an unused substitute owing to a knee injury.

Despite missing out on team silverware, Bellingham's performances, which saw him register 14 goals and seven assists, earnt him the Bundesliga Player of the Season award.

Bellingham snubbed interest from the likes of Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City to sign for Real Madrid in June 2023.

Los Blancos paid an initial £88.4m for Bellingham, which could rise to as much as £115m with add-ons.

He is currently the third most expensive English player of all-time, behind international colleagues Declan Rice and Jack Grealish, although he could rise to the top of the list if the add-ons are met.

Bellingham's Madrid career got off to a dream start with a goal on his debut against Athletic Club, which was followed by a brace in his second game against Almeria and then late winners against Celta Vigo and Getafe.

His exploits in front of goal saw him become just the third player to score in each of his first four games for the club.

Arguably the finest moment of his Real Madrid career to date was when he scored two goals, one of which was a 92nd minute winner, in the 2-1 El Clasico win over Barcelona in October.

Bellingham, who is the first Madrid player to score on his La Liga, Champions League and El Clasico debut, broke the record for the most goals scored in a player's first 15 games for the club when his 14th strike arrived against Cadiz in November.

Just weeks after winning the Kopa Trophy, Bellingham was announced as the winner of the Golden Boy award for 2023, which is awarded to the best U21 footballer playing in one of the top five divisions in Europe.

The second trophy of Bellingham's career was claimed with a 4-1 win over Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final in January.

2024-02-01,The Witcher remake will remove 'oudated' parts and fans think it's romance cards,"CD Projekt's plans for remaking the original Witcher game involves removing anything that is 'bad, outdated, or unnecessarily convoluted.'

Although The Witcher 3 is the most successful role-playing game of all-time the first two entries are largely unknown by most gamers. The only console version of the second game was on the Xbox 360 and the first entry, from 2007, remains PC only.

On that level, a remake of the first game makes complete sense, except it wasn't actually very good and had little in common with The Witcher 3. CD Projekt seems to recognise that, with plans to change it considerably - including making it open world, even though the original was not.

Hopefully they'll improve the combat too, but it seems the 'romance cards', that Geralt collected every time he slept with a woman, are also likely to be removed - as even one of the original creators thinks they're not a good idea.

The collectible cards were censored in North American but in the original European version they featured nudity and highly suggestive poses.

Although they're not mentioned by name, CEO Jakub Rokosz told Edge magazine that 'first and foremost, we need an honest, down-to-earth analysis of which parts are simply bad, outdated, and need to be remade.'

Most fans have already accepted that the cards won't be in the remake, or at least not in a manner in any way similar to the original - especially as many considered them sexist even at the time.

Designer Karol Kowalczyk, who worked on the original but is no longer at CD Projekt, admitted in 2022 that, 'It is indeed very disturbing that the game kind of forces you to become a mindless sex addict to get some of those. We failed to see that as when you are testing the game for the 100th time, you start to do it mechanically and don't really feel those emotions.'

'With the experience I have now, I'd leave the drawings in the game, but remove any suggestions that this is a collectible, and also do a review of all the scenes and strip the game of those that were causing mixed feelings,' he told Time Extension.

Removing sexist or other bigoted elements from older games is often an issue with remakes, with Resident Evil 4 making changes to how it treats the character of Ashley.

The internet being what it is, there is often some pushback against this, but in most cases people seem to accept that attitudes have changed and invariably the elements that are removed do nothing to affect the gameplay or story.

2024-02-01,I thought I'd get the job. Then I found out my interviewer was an AI chatbot,"Glancing at the timer in the corner of the screen, then back to the question, I felt myself start to panic.

I had just 30 seconds left to answer and then we would move on.

The trouble was, I didn't understand the question and there was no one around to ask.

You might be picturing that I was doing a timed puzzle, or something frivolous and not worth getting worried about.

But I was actually doing an interview for a job I really wanted - and all that stood between me and it was an AI bot.

When I first applied for the role in journalism, I'd expected an interview with someone from the company; potentially even a panel of people who would listen and grade my answers against the job description.

Just like every other interview I'd had in the past.

But when I received the email last December to say I would be interviewed without anyone present, I was baffled.

Nevertheless, I prepared how I usually do, by looking at the organisation's website and job description, making notes of how my experience suits these, and reeling off some practice answers out loud.

But this prep would turn out to be useless, as the interview couldn't have been more different from what I was used to.

Logging onto an app and using a personalised link, I was told the interview would be limited to just five questions - which I didn't really feel captured the scope of the job - and then we began.

I was shown a question on a screen for 60 seconds before having to answer verbally within the minute. Then, if I didn't opt to give myself an additional 30 seconds, we'd move on.

I was hesitant, and blundered my way through the first question, beating myself up for my pauses and for looking at myself in my reflection too much, like an aspiring influencer.

I tend to be quite confident in interviews. I'm a people person and enjoy talking about my professional and personal experiences.

It certainly wasn't the case this time.

The next question included a term I'd never heard of before, meaning I panicked when answering. And I found the lack of a human interviewer, which meant I had no option to ask for more elaboration, frustrating. It could have made the difference.

Since there was no back and forth the way there would be with a human interviewer, no opportunity to ask my own questions, I felt cut short when it ended.

Instead of being the start of a personal relationship, this interview became a transactional and mechanical one - even verging on a performance. The more I thought about it, the more I realised, this was a devastating development.

A few days later, I found out I hadn't got the role, and I inevitably started to wonder if it wasn't because of my lack of skills for the job, but my inability and inexperience of automated interviews.

Was it because they couldn't sense my body language or communication skills? Maybe I didn't mention keywords that the AI might score me on? Could it be that my dodgy WiFi meant I missed out on key opportunities to score?

I'll never know, but as algorithms are being used to replace managerial tasks, we need to be asking ourselves about the ethics of this switch.

New research by the International Monetary Fund has shown that AI will affect almost 40% of jobs globally, with this being higher in advanced economies.

Instead of rushing to implement these tools under the guise of efficiency and increased productivity, we must recognise the potential trade-offs that this can have for workers and job security.

Algorithmic management - the process where human managers are replaced by AI systems that monitor and make decisions about workers - is fast becoming a dystopian reality for many.

Last year, research by the IPPR found that worker surveillance techniques are more likely to impact young people, women and ethnic minorities, with Black workers 52% more likely to face surveillance and people aged 16-29 in low-skilled work 49% more likely to be targeted.

Amazon workers in the UK made history when they went on strike for the first time last year at their Coventry warehouse, taking a stance against the culture of surveillance and unrealistic productivity targets that the company has instilled.

In the company, everything from toilet breaks to physical pauses in their movement (also known as Time Off Task) being measured meant that they could be disciplined by management, and in the long run, fired.

It's a dangerous precedent that is being set, and now having experienced it first hand, one I feel we all need to be taking much more note of.

In my future interviews, I'll be asking how companies use AI in the employment relationship - provided I'm interviewed by a person, of course.

AI is quickly becoming a norm, with businesses wanting to rush to seize the benefits, while workers become excluded from these conversations.

Efficiency and productivity are often cited as the motivations for introducing AI in the workplace. For many of us, this might hold true - for example, writing an email using a chatbot can offer us convenience.

But no chatbot or algorithm can replace the connection that comes with authentic conversation.

So much of the world of work involves serving, supporting and creating with others, and this is a process that only humans can understand.

Instead of rushing to replace those relationships, we should focus on bettering them.","AI will affect almost 40% of jobs globally, with this being higher in advanced economies.

2024-02-01,Call Of Duty: Black Ops Gulf War leak reveals all 55 launch weapons,"Another Call Of Duty leak has emerged, which claims to know which weapons will be available at launch in this year's Black Ops Gulf War.

Officially, nothing is know about this year's Call Of Duty, but rumours have long suggested it's a Black Ops game set during the 1991 Gulf War. In fact, a more recent leak claims to know the plan for the series for the next four years.

It's claimed that developer Treyarch will take on this year's release, but an official reveal isn't likely for several months.

In the meantime, another leak has pieced together more info and claims to know all the launch weapons in Black Ops Gulf War, including the Five-Seven, AK-74, and a Jetgun for Zombies.

Leaker Konni Vondy claims that Call Of Duty: Black Ops Gulf War will launch with 55 weapons, ranging from sniper rifles to assault rifles, shotguns, and knives. The usual, in other words.

They have posted the full list on Twitter, with what appears to be internal codenames, suggesting the list has been datamined from one of the the current game's files.

Among the most noticeable weapons are the AK-74 and M16 A2 assault rifles, the MP5 machinegun, the SVD Dragunov sniper rifle, and the Five-Seven pistol.

For the really heavy stuff, Black Ops Gulf War will also have the Panzerfaust 3 and FIM-92 Stinger rocket launchers , according to the leak, and a Raygun and Jetgun for Zombies.

The leaker also says that this year's title will have its own unique set of weapons and systems independent from Modern Warfare 2 and 3.

There's also a separate leak posted on Twitter by Still Alan, that suggests which perks will be available in Black Ops Gulf War for class customisation, as you can see below.

The function of the perks aren't stated, but it's easy to guess with codenames such as 'Third person,' 'Sonar,' 'Blastshield,' and Surveillance.'

More leaks are sure to follow throughout the year, and it'll be interesting to see if Call Of Duty: Black Ops Gulf War, or any other Call Of Duty title, will end up on Xbox Game Pass now that Microsoft has bought Activision.

2024-02-01,Carragher reveals what Ferguson told him when Klopp became Liverpool boss,"Jamie Carragher has revealed how Sir Alex Ferguson tipped Jurgen Klopp for big things at Liverpool shortly after he was unveiled as the club's manager back in 2015.

Last week, Klopp sent shockwaves around the footballing world with his announcement confirming that he will step down as Liverpool's head coach in the summer after nine trophy-laden years at the top.

Klopp will go down as an all-time Liverpool great after steering the Reds to six major trophies across his tenure - including the Champions League and the Premier League - and the 56-year-old will be desperate to add to this tally when he bows out at the end of the season.

It leaves enormous shoes to fill in the Liverpool dugout and work is now underway to find a successor to the former Borussia Dortmund boss, with Xabi Alonso the bookmakers' favourite to take over the reins after a barnstorming start to life in management at Bayer Leverkusen.

Carragher believes Alonso has all the credentials to succeed on Merseyside but knows it will be no mean feat given the extraordinary job Klopp has done in transforming the club's fortunes to compete with Pep Guardiola's Manchester City.

Speaking on The Overlap, Carragher also explained just how highly former Manchester United boss Ferguson rated Klopp when the German took over from Brendan Rodgers eight-and-a-half years ago.

'I'm not sure you can replace him. The big thing about Klopp is, I've seen him in private at times, or little meetings, and he is exactly what you see on TV - it's not an act, it is him,' the ex-Liverpool and England defender said.

'Whoever comes in must be themselves - they can't be Jurgen Klopp.

'I always go back to a testimonial at Manchester United, I think it was for Michael Carrick. I was playing in it, and Sir Alex Ferguson was the manager of one of the teams and he was coming round the dressing room. Klopp had been announced as Liverpool manager two weeks before, and he said to me ""You've got a manager"".

'It was to do with those UEFA meetings, when all the top managers in Europe come together. He is just being himself - he was only at Borussia Dortmund then.

'I always remember when Klopp came on Monday Night Football, and I asked him about these meetings. He said he only went twice, he said ""I just wanted to check if I was as good as them, and I was, so I didn't need to go again!""

'I thought he was very confident, very comfortable in his own skin.

'He's a god in Liverpool - who knows what's going to happen this season. When I got the news, I couldn't process it!'

Former Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann agrees with Carragher that Alonso is the outstanding candidate to take over from Klopp in the summer, though hopes to see the Spaniard stay on for another season at Leverkusen.

'Well, the story coming out of Leverkusen, he extended his contract earlier in the season but I'm sure they've got an agreement so that if he wants to leave in the summer, he can go,' Hamann told The Stand with Eamon Dunphy podcast.

'As a football romantic, I would love to see him do another season at Leverkusen.

'But the problem might be, can they keep the team together? They've got some outstanding players and I think one or two will leave which obviously will harm their chances next season.

'I think if Liverpool come calling, I think it's very hard to turn down, even though he follows in Klopp's footsteps. But the thing is, sometimes the big clubs, they only come once.

'If somebody comes in in the summer and does well, the job might not be on offer for five or six years, or maybe nine years if they find another Klopp. So, I think if Liverpool come calling, I think he'll take it.'

2024-02-01,US chicken shop that's 'better than KFC' is opening 15 new UK restaurants,"When it comes to chicken, KFC has become the go-to fast food chain of choice for many in the UK - but that could be about to change thanks to Wingstop.

The popular US chicken shop is set to open 15 new stores across the country in 2024.

Wingstop has been hailed by fans as being 'better than KFC', with social media users branding their chicken wings and fries 'unreal'. And it's well known to have garnered the seal of approval of celebs like Stormzy, Central Cee, Rick Ross, Lil Nas X, and AJ Tracey.

The Dallas-born chicken company first arrived in the UK in 2018 and as of November 2023 had launched in 39 places.

The new restaurants will see the chain's customer base grow in areas such as Essex, Hertfordshire, and Yorkshire, with nine of the 15 locations already confirmed and six being negotiated.

Many of the new branches will be in London, adding to the capital's exisiting US fast food offerings which include Popeyes, Taco Bell, and Chipotle.

The news will be cause for celebration for some, as Instagram users have been begging Wingstop to open more stores for ages.

A quick look at the official Instagram account shows the comment section is flooded with messages demanding they open new stores here, there, and everywhere.

As well as chicken wings, the chain's menu also includes chicken tenders, boneless chicken, burgers, churros, loaded fries, combos, and platters.

And for each chicken option, there's a choice of flavours -- Ranch, Blue Cheese, Lemon Pepper, Mango Habanero, Louisiana Rub, Atomic, Brazilian Citrus Pepper, Hickory Smoked BBQ, Hawaiian, Garlic Parmesean, Spicy Korean Q, or Honey-Mustard. Yum!

But what do people think of the food? On X (formerly Twitter), a user named @SELFMADECrumpo proclaimed: '@wingstop chicken sandwiches 10x better than @ChickfilA @Popeyes @McDonalds @Zaxbys @kfc and whoever else make em.'

Over on Instagram, @official_taste_buds wrote: 'Absolutely love the food at Wingstop! We need one closer to us in the midlands area though!'

Similarly, @abbiemyerscough thought Wingstop's chicken tenders were the 'best thing ever'.

Metro previously tried the chicken chain when it first arrived in London and the spicy atomic wings proved too much for our reporter, Brett.

He said: 'Selecting the classic Wingstop lemon pepper and the spiciest atomic wings (both with ranch dip) was perhaps a blessing in disguise. The mild lemon pepper wings were a nice sanctuary from the fiery pits of hell you're transported to after taking a bite of the atomics.

'Be prepared to have your lips burn and tingle after just the slightest taste, as you scramble to put the spice to rest by distracting your taste buds with ranch-dipped fries (sadly this solution did not have the desired effect).

'Speaking of the fries, the seasoning was perhaps not as potent as I hoped. Instead of a kick of lemon pepper, I got something more akin to a nudge.'

But this didn't put him off, instead Brett confessed that he wanted to try all the different wing flavours and was upset he couldn't tackle a platter of 24 all by himself.

He added: 'I couldn't help but want to maybe try 10 wings in five flavours -- 16 pieces in two flavours was definitely too much. You can get a wing platter, which consists of three flavours and 24 pieces, but you might need to recruit a friend or two to the cause first.

'Perhaps part of Wingstop's charm is that each flavour is like a different colourway of the latest Jordan or Yeezy -- you might have copped yours but you can't help but glance over at the person next to you to see what they went for.

2024-02-01,1970s band reuniting for the first time in 30 years after huge controversy,"It's been 30 years since Blue Mink's two lead singers performed together, but they're back.

Roger Cook and Madeline Bell are reuniting in 2024 for a concert marking the latter's 80th birthday.

Sharing lead vocals in Blue Mink, they collaborated on six Top 20 UK hits including Melting Pot, Good Morning Freedom and The Banner Man.

Originally formed of Madeline, Roger, Alan Parker, Roger Coulam, Herbie Flowers and Barry Morgan in 1969, the British pop group enjoyed eight years together before their eventual split.

The band are perhaps best known for their chart-topping debut single Melting Pot, which has very controversial lyrics.

Its lyrics triggered Ofcom to reprimand golden oldies radio station Gold in 2019 after a DJ played the song.

The track - said to be written by Roger Cook and Roger Greenaway - describes wanting a 'melting pot' of cultures to solve the world's problems.

However, in the process it used phrases like 'red Indian boy', described Chinese people as 'yellow' before using a racial slur, mentioned 'coffee coloured people' and used the term 'Curly Latin kinkies'.

After a complaint, Ofcom said the song contained 'derogatory references to particular ethnic groups'.

Global, Gold's owner, defended the track choice, noting Blue Mink wrote it to promote racial harmony, and they said the context in which the track was played - on a vintage-loving station - meant the lyrics were unlikely to cause offence.

However, Ofcom ruled that the song's lyrics could still cause offence, no matter what era they were written in, and the context did not justify their inclusion in the station's track list.

The watchdog also ruled that Global didn't point out the song's title in advance, and so listeners may not have fully grasped the message behind it.

Band member Herbie previously talked about the Melting Pot controversy, and said they were 'naive' musicians when it was written.

'I suppose we were just rather naïve musicians. Racism and sexism were not part of our consciousness then,' he told the Daily Mail.

'I don't think it occurred to any of us there was anything wrong with it. People didn't say ""what terrible lyrics"", they thought it was rather catchy.

'Of course, I can see why it wouldn't be very acceptable now, but as it is there are far worse things played on Radio 1 these days, songs full of obscenities and violence.'

Madeline and Roger are reuniting for a one-off show at London's Cadogan Hall on April 13.

Singer Madeline started her career as a backing singer for Dusty Springfield and sang on Joe Cocker's cover of The Beatles' With A Little Help From My Friends.

'I was shocked,' Madeline said of the Ofcom ruling in 2019. 'It took years to suddenly decide in this politically correct time that we live in that it was an offensive and racist record.

'With everything that we've got to worry about in this world, we're worrying about the lyrics of a protest song about making coffee-coloured people. This is the kind of age we live in.

'The song is 50 years old. Please leave it alone. I just think it's ridiculous.'

2024-02-01,Friends star admits he was 'head over heels' in love with Jennifer Aniston,"So, it turns out Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer weren't the only cast members who had a crush on Jennifer Aniston during their time on Friends.

Ben Geller star Cole Sprouse has admitted he was 'head over heels in love' with co-star Jennifer Aniston during his time on the show.

Cole, 31, became a prominent child actor during the 2000s and featured in more than half-a-dozen episodes of Friends between the year 2000 and 2002.

Starring as Ross Geller's son, Cole rose to prominence during his time on the series and eventually landed a role on Disney series The Suite Life of Zac and Cody, along with his brother Dylan.

And now Cole has admitted that, during his time on the sitcom, he was 'head over heels' in love with co-star Jennifer Aniston - who played Rachel Green - admitting to sometimes forgetting his lines while he was looking at her.

Appearing on US morning talk show Live With Kelly and Mark, he said: 'I was on Friends for about eight to 10 episodes. I think I was like seven or eight (years old) at the time.'

When asked how he felt about working with Jennifer, he confessed: 'I was head over heels about her. I've said it a couple of times before but I blanked when she looked at me in the eyes. Like I completely lost all of my lines, all the prep.'

One episode in particular, The One With the Truth About London, sees Rachel teaching Ben about pranks she used to play on her sisters.

And Cole admitted that being on set for the biggest show in the world was sometimes tough to handle: 'I knew there was an energy in the studio that made me go, this is the biggest show in the world.'

Speaking about working with Jennifer, as well as David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and Courteney Cox, he added: 'I knew it was massive, and I felt very intimidated when I walked in.'

Cole also told hosts Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos that he never watched episodes of Friends after he was done filming them because, despite appearing on the show, he was 'too young'.

'I'd never seen Friends. I never watched it. I was always too young.'

After finishing up on Friends, Cole went on to have a lengthy TV and film CV, appearing as Cody Martin in Disney series The Suit Life of Zac and Cody, as well as its spin-off show The Suite Life on Deck.

He also appeared as Cody in special episodes of fellow Disney Channel series, including Hannah Montana and That's So Raven, before appearing in The Suite Life Movie in 2011.

Later in his career, after some time out of the spotlight, he returned to TV as Jughead Jones on Riverdale, which he was involved with for six years between 2017 and its conclusion in 2023.

2024-02-01,"More humiliation for Putin after £55,000,000 warship 'sunk by sea drone'","Ukraine has claimed to have sunk another Russian warship in an attack by a kamikaze sea drone.

The Telegram channel Military Informant posted: 'As a result of a number of direct hits to the hull, the Russian ship received damage that was incompatible with further movement - the Ivanovets tilted to the stern and sank.'

The warship was in sea lake Donuzlav, a bay in the west of Crimea, often used for military vessels.

Russian officials have not officially confirmed the strike, but pro-Putin war Telegram channels have done so.

Multiple drones are believed to have staged the attack from the sea near Odessa in the operation, spearheaded by Group 13 special forces of the Ukrainian GUR military intelligence agency.

If confirmed, the Ivanovets is the latest Putin warship to be sunk - adding to the list which includes the Moskva cruiser, a Black Sea Fleet flagship which was sunk by Neptune missiles in April 2022.

Vladimir Putin has still not given an accurate toll for the losses on the sunken Moskva.

Several large landing ships have been sunk, including most recently the Novocherkassk, which was struck December 26, 2023.

2024-02-01,Hollyoaks' Jessica Fox 'struggling to keep her eyes open' after watching baby,"Hollyoaks star Jessica Fox was struggling to stay awake after spending the night with her baby.

The actress, who plays Nancy Osbourne in the Channel 4 soap, took to Instagram Stories and revealed that she spent the night checking her baby boy River on the monitor.

She shared a quick video of her head in her hands along with the caption: 'The baby had a good night but I stayed awake all night staring at the monitor to check. 'Why am I like this?'

Last March, the soap star confirmed the arrival of her little one on social media.

'Baby River, you have changed our world forever,' she wrote, revealing her little one's name. 'We are so grateful we get to love you.'

A number of Jessica's Hollyoaks co-stars were quick to comment, with Nadine Mulkerrin, who played Cleo McQueen, writing: 'Welcome to the world River', while Gregory Finnegan (James Nightingale) added: 'Wonderful news! Congrats mate, can't wait to meet the little dude x'

Donna-Marie Quinn star Lucy-Jo Hudson, meanwhile, wrote: 'Ahhhhhh Jess..... yes..... finally..... you get to hold your beautiful baby in your arms!!!!

'I'm so bloody happy for you! Love the name.'

Jessica first shared that she was pregnant in October 2022 while opening up about her experiences with miscarriages for Baby Loss Awareness Week.

Jessica was written out of the show earlier this year when she went on maternity leave, with Nancy going to the US to try and get the best treatment available for baby Morgan, who had been diagnosed with a heart condition.

During her time off, Jessica also embraced a brand new look, which she showed off in the new selfie.

2024-02-01,Shoppers say these foot masks give them 'baby soft' feet - and it's on sale,"SHOPPING - Contains affiliated content. Products featured in this Metro article are selected by our shopping writers. If you make a purchase using links on this page, Metro.co.uk will earn an affiliate commission. Click here for more information.

Don't come for us, but there's no denying that those foot-peeling videos on TikTok are, though revolting, absolutely satisfying in equal measure.

Sloughing away dead, hard skin to reveal baby soft feet, a foot-peeling mask is a pretty cheap and easy alternative to a costly pedicure with all the bells and whistles, even if it means you're shedding like an iguana for a couple weeks.

So as you can imagine, we (and clearly hoards of Amazon shoppers) were pretty psyched when we saw that the Plantifique Foot Peel Masks were on offer with 20% off, meaning you could get silky smooth tootsies for under 20 quid.

Barg much?

Working to transform dry and cracked feet, these masks utilise a unique Plantis formula to literally shed the dead skin cells off your feet, leaving you with super-soft and smooth feet.

By targeting the deepest layers of the skin, the Plantifique foot masks effortlessly exfoliate your feet, utilising lactic acid to actively eliminate dead and dry skin, as well as a superfood complex including peach kernel and aloe which helps to rejuvenate and accelerate the regeneration of skin cells.

And while that may sound slightly like a torture device, its actually completely pain free.

The only 'catch' is that your feet will be shedding for at least a week, with shoppers remarking of large flakes falling off their feet each day. But in our opinion, that can hardly be a bad thing if it means the masks are working.

But it does just mean you're going to want to do everyone a favour and stay out of flip flops for a bit.

Amassing over 20,360 five-star reviews from Amazon shoppers raving of how easy the masks were to use and how well they peeled their skin away, we'd say they sound like a must-try - especially for the price.

'Easy to use, washes off well.' One five-star Amazon reviewer wrote. 'Took about 10 days to nice first signs of peeling and once it started it carried on for about 2 weeks so plan well if you're thinking about wearing sandals. I will definitely use again. Like it so much that I forced it on my husband as well.'

'Fabulously disgusting!' Cattie5683 added. 'The skin came off in massive chunks but you must not peel them. My skin underneath was baby soft! It was amazing!

'By the end of the 2nd week, all the skin on my feet peeled off and they felt like new. I definitely recommend!!'

A third Amazon reviewer added: 'I was quite skeptical as not seeing any results until day 5-6. Then the peeling started. Oh boy, I feel like a snake going through intense metamorphosis stage now!'

All you have to do is soak your feet in warm water for 10 minutes, then strap on the masks for about an hour and a half. You should start to notice the peeling process within a few days.

So, why not get your feet beach ready now? We're sure you'll be peel-eased with the results...

2024-02-01,Map reveals all the space junk we've already littered on Mars,"News that the Mars helicopter Ingenuity had broken a blade and could no longer fly was a sad day for fans of the pioneering chopper.

It also added an extra 1.8 kilograms to the growing pile of junk left on the Red Planet by humans.

Since Russia's Mars 2 lander touched down at 5.22pm on May 19, 1971, humans have been littering our planetary neighbour - although all in the name of science.

Now, there's more than seven tonnes of debris scattered across Mars, from parachutes and heat shields deployed during fiery landings, to drill bits, chunks of tyre and, of course, the tip of Ingenuity's wing.

And if you're not sure what seven tonnes looks like, it's about the same as seven giraffes, or three trim rhinos.

Such measurements are irrelevant on Mars however, where none of the many landers or rovers have managed to conclusively show life ever existed... yet.

Three are currently still working hard to help turn telltale signs into definitive proof however - Nasa's Curiosity and Perseverance rovers, and China's Zhurong rover.

While operational, the rovers aren't classed as space junk, but sadly for those who crash landed or have since 'died', they're all in the trash tally.

That includes the Mars 6 lander, which malfunctioned on landing, and Britain's Beagle 2, which failed to phone home after its scheduled landing on Christmas Day, 2003. Beagle 2 remained MIA until January 2015, when Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter snapped an image of the lander sitting peacefully on the red dirt.

All had gone to plan until two of its four solar panels failed to open, blocking the craft's communications antenna.

Soon after Beagle 2, Nasa successfully deployed the twin Spirit and Opportunity rovers, groundbreaking vehicles that discovered not only was Mars wetter than previously thought during its past, but that the conditions could have sustained microbial life.

Both worked far beyond their initial 90-day missions, with Opportunity trundling around the planet for nearly 15 years, only signing off in 2019.

In 2022, Nasa's Insight lander also signed off the final time after four years on the planet with an emotional farewell on X, then Twitter.

'My power's really low, so this may be the last image I can send,' the post read. 'Don't worry about me though: my time here has been both productive and serene. If I can keep talking to my mission team, I will - but I'll be signing off here soon. Thanks for staying with me.'

Insight followed the space agency's Phoenix lander, which touched down in May 2008, but wrapped up its mission quickly, in November of that year.

It's not just entire vehicles themselves causing the debris either. The working rovers are prone to leaving a trail of litter in their wake. Perseverance dropped a drill bit during a mission in July 2021, and the jagged Martian surface has ripped many holes in its tyre tracks, leaving shreds of material as it goes.

Some missions have left more dramatic evidence of their presence however - particularly those that failed.

Nasa's ambitious Polar Lander was lost on arrival in December 1999. In 2005, the agency released images of what it believes is the crash site, including scorch marks and a parachute.

However, it is all in the name of science, as Dr James Blake from the University of Warwick's physics department told Metro.co.uk.

'It's common for space missions to discard debris and rovers/helicopters sometimes come across debris fields while exploring,' he said.

'With current technology, there's still an unfortunate balance that needs to be struck between scientific discovery and the impact of missions on the natural environment of these remote worlds.

'It's important that future missions are designed with sustainability in mind to ensure that the human footprint is minimised.'

The ultimate aim of that scientific discovery is for humans to eventually land on Mars, something all of these landers, successful or not, will help us achieve.

And when we do get there, chances are all the vehicles that came before us will be cherished monuments to human endeavour, rather than trash to be cleaned up.","Ingenuity broke a blade and couldn't fly, adding an extra 1.8 kilograms to the growing pile of junk left on the Red Planet by humans.

2024-02-01,'Absolutely minging' new Nestle chocolate divides shoppers,"Nestle has just unveiled a brand new sweet treat - combining a beloved chocolate with a childhood dessert favourite.

The confectionary giant has launched Aero Melts - bitesize pieces of the famous aerated chocolate - in a new and exciting nostalgic flavour: Neapolitan ice cream.

These new Aero Melts in the Neapolitan Ice Cream variety - AKA strawberry, chocolate and vanilla - are available at Asda for £1.35.

The throwback taste in question is the latest launch from Nestle, however not everyone can work out whether it's one for them.

A picture of the new bite-sized treats shared on the Facebook group New Foods UK this week has prompted more than 400 people to share their own thoughts.

One person named Matt Creighton replied: 'Can't decide if these sound good or not.'

'Absolutely minging,' David Monk replied.

'I hope they're nicer than the honeycomb ones,' someone else chipped in.

However, lots of others have been tagging loved ones and raving about how much they want to try them.

Debbie Thorpe replied to the post: 'Need need need.'

'I would like a bag of these please' added Samantha Higgins.

But this isn't the only new Aero flavour to launch this week. The bubbly sweet treat is now available in a Choco Hazelnut flavour, which is likely to please Nutella fans.

Anyone with a sweet tooth can also add some other new additions to their trolley.

Cadbury has recently unveiled a new twist on 'best ever' product, while an 'ultra rare' Twix and Snickers snack has been spotted in a lesser-known supermarket.

2024-02-01,Ian Wright reveals the mistake Mikel Arteta made in handling Arsenal bust-up,"The Gunners survived a late scare and secured a 2-1 victory against Nottingham Forest at the City Ground but the post-match focus centred on the row between two Arsenal defenders.

White was understood to be annoyed by the way in which Zinchenko played Gonzalo Montiel onside in the lead-up to Taiwo Awoniyi's goal which sparked a frantic finale.

Zinchenko's defending has been in the spotlight recently and he made an identical error in the recent 1-1 draw against Liverpool which played a part in Mohamed Salah's equaliser.

Arteta made a beeline for the Ukraine international after the full-time whistle in an attempt to diffuse the situation but Wright believes he should have let players resolve the matter for themselves.

The Arsenal legend told The Overlap: 'I just saw it as it happened, I was like, 'What's happening with them two?', but he went over and he pointed, he said something, and Zinchenko wasn't happy with it.

'Zinchenko is a very emotional guy. What I like about Ben White is, he's the player who's got that look - he will tell you, and he probably told him, then Mikel [Arteta] came on.

'I would have preferred you let them play it out [on the pitch] - it's not like they were going to have a fight. You go in the dressing room and deal with it there but to see the manager coming out and talking to him right there and then, I'm thinking, '[deal with it in the dressing room]'.

Despite victory over Forest, Arsenal remain five points adrift of leaders Liverpool ahead of Sunday's summit meeting after the Reds romped to 4-1 win against Chelsea last night.

'We [Arsenal] can't lose [against Liverpool], that's the main thing - we mustn't lose at home,' added Wright.

'I'd rather us not get beaten. Get the three points from Forest, a team that we struggled to beat the last three games and then Liverpool, you go for it and at some stage you say, 'Do you know what, we'll take a point here off of them'.

'I like where we are now. Against Palace - I didn't expect Palace to be as poor as they were - but at the same time, Arsenal really put them away ruthlessly.'

2024-02-01,Terrified TV icon sobs as she's confronted by ghost who haunted her for 50 years,"Tina Malone claims a ghost has been haunting her for over 50 years, and she grabbed an opportunity to confront him with both hands.

The Shameless actor came 'face-to-face' with the supernatural on Celebrity Help! My House Is Haunted and ended up in tears at the meeting.

Firstly, 61-year-old Tina, who recently celebrated 25 years sober, made it clear she isn't bothered if people are judgemental of her belief in the paranormal.

'I am quite open about my relationship with my ghost. People do think I'm mad, eccentric or a bit potty. I don't care,' she insisted.

For over five decades, she's been 'followed' by William James McKenzie in 12 different homes. She believes he is a well-known rich merchant who had already been dead for over 100 years by the time they met, and even calls him an 'eligible bachelor'. Maybe she should get him set up on Hinge - that could be one way to get him out of the house.

Tina told the camera crew that sometimes he looks a bit, well ghosty, and other times, he makes a little bit of an effort.

'Some days he would have this grey face, some days he would have almost like a Skeletor-type face, under the top hat,' she alleges.

Despite, James digging out his best hat, Tina thinks it is time he packed up all his ghostly belongings and cleared off. To try to wave goodbye forever, she even moved into a new Cheshire home.

To help her sort the problem were dark arts specialist Ian Lawman, paranormal researcher historian Jayne Harris, and investigator Barri Ghai who brought along all their special equipment to get him gone.

Using a smart-looking bit of tech they reached out to the other side to capture and project spirit voices.

'Is that William James McKenzie?' Tina calls out. 'What do you want from me, James?'

'Yes,' comes the reply. 'Help me...'

They then ask James if he sold his soul to the devil, and he seems to confirm.

At another point, Tina takes part in a scrying session, which combines ancient methods of talking to the dead, in the hope of receiving messages or visions from the other side.

It works and Tina begins to think see Jayne transforming into James. 'Oh wow,' she said through tears.

'Your face is proper changing, James!

'Your forehead is, like, protruding and your eyebrows are really bushy. Oh my God, this is so weird!' added Tina.

Naturally, she was left pretty shaken by the whole experience.

2024-02-01,Hollyoaks star Nadine Mulkerrin seeks medical help over child's skin symptoms,"Cleo McQueen actress Nadine Mulkerrin, who has recently returned to Hollyoaks, has shared her concerns after discovering a noticeable rash on her son's body.

In dramatic scenes last week we saw Nadine's character Cleo caught up in a huge car crash stunt that saw her welcomed back into the Hollyoaks fold with a bang, alongside her cousin Theresa (Jorgie Porter) and aunt Myra (Nicole Barber-Lane).

We also saw Cleo reunite with ex-boyfriend Joel Dexter (Rory Douglas-Speed) just moments before he was dramatically mowed down by a lorry, forcing medical officials to place him into an induced coma to aid his recovery.

She's rarely been away from Joel's bedside, much to the annoyance of his current girlfriend Leela Lomax (Kirsty-Leigh Porter) who has warned her to move on.

But actress Nadine needn't move on - she is engaged to co-star Rory and the couple share two young sons together; four year old Reggie, and 20 month old Dougie.

Taking to Instagram yesterday, Mulkerrin shared a picture of one of their boys with a blotchy red eczema-like outbreak on the right hand side of his body and armpit, telling her 483k followers: 'He's already been treated for a skin infection with antibiotics but it's come back?'

'Any medical people on here? Eczema?' she added, with a question sticker that allows people to add their own responses.

According to the NHS website, atopic eczema is defined as 'a very common skin condition affecting at least one in every five children.'

2024-02-01,Hero pharmacist saves teacher after he was 'stabbed by schoolchildren',"A heroic pharmacist saved a teacher's life after he was stabbed by a group of children, some in school uniform, just two weeks after starting a new job.

Gulzarin Iqbal, 27, ended up covered in blood after tending to the wounded man after he was stabbed in the back with a long knife outside Forest gate School in east London.

Mr Iqbal, a physician associate at the nearby Lord Lister Health Centre, said: 'I had finished with patients for the day and was doing paperwork when I heard people arguing outside.

'It sounded like a man and a group of younger people.

'Their voices were raised, but I thought it might be just a normal altercation - it is east London.

'But then I heard someone scream and so I ran outside to see what was happening.

'By this time the group had gone, but I could see people in the pharmacy. I ran across the road and there was a man lying face down on the floor.

'There was a lot of blood.'

The victim was described as an african male in his 40s, of average build. He told the horrified staff that was a teacher at the local school and had only started there a few weeks ago.

Some of the attackers were known to him but not all of them, he said.

A woman who works as a dispenser at Sharman's Pharmacy, but asked not to be named, said: 'He ran inside and said, ""Help! I'm a teacher at the school and I've just been stabbed.""

'There was blood all over the floor. He had been stabbed in the back.

'We quickly called the police and the ambulance, and a man from the health centre over the road came to help.

'The emergency services were here almost immediately and they took him away.'

Dr Parvesh Patel, a pharmacist at Sharman's sister shop Mansons Pharmacy, added: 'I guess he thought a pharmacy was the safest place to be.'

'He said he had been stabbed with a long knife, but I didn't see it.

'I immediately applied pressure to the wound, which was on his back.

'There's always the worry of death after a stabbing, as people can bleed out. You just never know what the outcome is going to be.

'The people at the pharmacy called the police and ambulance, and when the police turned up, I told the officer to apply pressure so I could go get supplies from the health centre.

'By this point my arms were covered in blood.

'I brought back a defibrillator, just in case, and a heart monitor to check his vitals.

'The ambulance arrived about five minutes later.'

Police later confirmed that the man's injuries are not life-threatening.

2024-02-01,"'Fairytale' city that's 1,500 years old is one of Europe's hidden gems","If you fancy a magical getaway teeming with history and away from the hustle and bustle of the city, we have the perfect suggestion for you: Carcassonne.

Nestled in the southeast of France, not far from the border with Spain, Carcassonne is like a real-life fairytale land, with stunning scenery and a thriving foodie culture.

With a population of just 45,996 people, the city in the region of Occitania is the perfect destination for a short break full of culture and relaxation.

The city, which has been inhabited since the Neolithic (around the time that Stone Henge was built), is home to Europe's largest surviving mediaeval walled city.

Another key selling point of the large, fortified city is its quaint village, which looks straight out of a storybook.

And just a two-hour flight away from London... what's not to love?

Lizzie Collin, who visited Carcassonne last year, said the city is beautiful during both day and night.

'The fortified city is so picturesque with a beautiful atmosphere,' she wrote on TripAdvisor.

'Free to walk around and full of restaurants, shops.

'A visit to the castle can be added to fully enjoy the views and the architecture.'

Given it's location, it shouldn't surprise anyone that Carcassonne is a gastronomic destination and the city has it's own specialities you simply have to try when you go.

The most traditional dish of the region is a cassoulet, a stew which has been described as a 'celebration for the senses'.

The meal is cooked in a terracotta cassole and uses ingredients such as Lingot beans, pork or duck to make the bubbling winter warmer. Other versions include Toulouse sausage, or even pheasant in the mix.

Cassoulet is available in a number of restaurants in Carcassonne, so you won't have a hard time finding some to try.

Other foodie items that shouldn't be missed include truffles, (which you can buy from the city market and many shops), Lucques olives, Languedoc style snails, and dry liver sausage from the local butcher's shop.

And with it being France, there are also a number of fabulous pastries waiting to be devoured, including a frozen version of the iconic Cassoulet. The sweet treat resembles the traditional dish, but is made with ice cream in a nougatine cassole. Yum!

A quick look on Tripadvisor will show you the top rated restaurants in the city, while those who prefer street food can always opt for a market walking tour, meeting local producers and sampling delicacies along the way.

Carcassonne has an average footfall of three million, welcoming tourists all-year round.

The peak tourist season in the city is June to August -- with Bastille Day (the national day of France) on 14 July, this is a great time to experience a buzzy, festive atmosphere.

Spring is an ideal time to visit if you want nice weather and a more relaxed atmosphere.

If crowds and long queues aren't your thing, it's a good idea to visit Carcassonne during the week, or earlier in the morning if you choose to go on a weekend.

During the peak summer months, the average temperature hovers around a lovely 23°C, however highs can reach a balmy 28°C.

While winter (from December to February) is quite mild, with highs of

11°C and lows of 4°C.

You can fly direct to Carcassonne from London for around £22. Return flights cost around £45.

You can also fly to Toulouse for £34 and take a 1.5 hour train to Carcassonne.

Carcassonne is the ideal place for a short, two-night stay - and hotels prices for this start at around £130.

Conde Nast Traveller recommends the Hotel de la Cite Carcassonne - MGallery Collection, which has a pool, and costs £235 for two nights.

You can also nab a two-night say at the SOWELL COLLECTION Hôtel du Roi & SPA for £138.

If you're travelling as a group, you can book a lovely two-bedroom house which sleeps four people and costs just £256 for two nights, on Booking.com.

In total, that's between £114 and £285, depending on how many people you're travelling with.

2024-02-01,US suffering 'out-of-control' STI epidemic - and the government is in despair,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are spiralling 'out of control' in the US, a government agency has warned, with millions of Americans infected every year.

The latest figures include a 937% rise in cases of congenital syphilis, a major risk to the lives of newborn babies, over the past decade.

Announcing the update, the Centres for Disease Control (CDC) was unable to conceal its exasperation, giving off major disappointed parent vibes.

'Yet again, more than 2.5 million cases of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and syphilis were reported in the United States,' it said.

Chlamydia reigned king of the STIs, with around 1.6 million cases across the nation in 2022, the latest full year for which data is available.

Gonorrhea claimed second spot with just shy of 650,000 cases.

But what is concerning public health officials is the sharp increase in syphilis - which has risen 80% in the past five years to a grand total of 203,500 cases for syphilis of all stages.

In adults, if syphilis remains untreated and develops into its final stage (which is very rare), it can be fatal, but luckily, when caught in the early stages, it can be treated with antibiotics.

The disease is spread though vaginal, anal or oral sex, with the primary stages usually showing symptoms of sores around the mouth or genitals, and secondary stages showing rashes around the body with flu-like symptoms.

It should be noted that many people can also have the disease and not have any symptoms.

The first two stages are the most infectious, and the report reveals a 10% increase in 2022, and a 68% increase since 2018.

However, the most concerning finding was an increase in congenital syphilis, where 3,755 cases were recorded.

Congenital syphilis (CS) is where a mother with syphilis passes on the infection to her baby during pregnancy which can impact the health of the baby.

The disease can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, prematurity, low birth weight or death shortly after birth. Babies born with CS can have deformed bones, severe anaemia, an enlarged liver and spleen, jaundice, brain and nerve problems, meningitis or skin rashes.

'Tragically, these infections resulted in 282 stillbirths and infant deaths in 2022,' said Laura Bachmann, the CDC director for STD Prevention.

The highest number of cases occurred around those who are Black or African American - who experienced around 30% of cases - Hispanic and Latino, and White.

Native American or Alaska Native people experienced the highest rate of congenital syphilis, with one case for every 155 births in 2022.

Getting timely syphilis testing during pregnancy could have prevented 88% of these cases.

'The STI field has reached a tipping point,' said Ms Bachmann.

'We have long known that these infections are common, but we have not faced such severe effects of syphilis in decades.

'Recent public health emergencies diverted programme resources and threatened the health of those already disproportionately affected by STIs. We must move now to pick up the pieces.'

Other public health officials have also voiced their concerns.

'The CDC's latest STI data shows that our nation is facing a rapidly deteriorating public health crisis with real lives at stake,' the National Coalition of STD Directors (NCSDDC) said.

'STIs - especially syphilis - will continue to spiral out of control until the administration and Congress provide communities with the funding they need to provide the most basic screening, treatment, and prevention services.'

Experts in the US are expecting 2023 to be worse as the report does not reflect the workforce cuts and drug shortages experienced in the time since.","Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are spiralling 'out of control' in the US.

2024-02-01,Ivory Coast fan reveals what he told woman after AFCON win & apologises to wife,"An Ivory Coast supporter who went viral after his nation's win over Senegal at the Africa Cup of Nations has issued an apology to his wife after he was caught trying to get a woman's phone number during the celebrations.

AFCON hosts Ivory Coast dumped out reigning champions Senegal on penalties in their last-16 tie on Monday evening, which sets up a quarter-final clash with Mali this Saturday.

But another incident at the Charles Konan Banny Stadium was seen by millions worldwide as television cameras spotted Ivory Coast fan Anselme Santos speaking closely to a woman in the stands whilst everyone celebrated around them.

The woman clearly looked disinterested by the approach and Santos has now revealed that in the 'euphoria' of Ivory Coast's win, he asked for her number.

Santos says he is now 'saddened' and 'upset' after watching his actions back in the viral video and has apologised to the female Senegal supporter, as well as his own family.

'Since we were at the hotel we were with the Senegal fans, having fun, we danced, we ate, we got the bus to the stadium, everyone was having fun,' Santos said in an interview with Live TV on Wednesday evening.

'We arrived at the stadium, we had the first goal, Senegal fans were trying to tease us but that's the game. At the stadium we're having fun, everyone is happy. If you went to the stadium to be sad it's not good, if Senegal fans sat one side and us the other there would be no atmosphere.

'So that's how you saw it in the video, I was sitting further up [away from the woman] and I was walking down when I saw her waving the Senegalese flag.

'In the euphoria, we're having fun, we're teasing each other, I told her, 'give me your number'. I didn't insist and when she didn't want to I went back to my friend nearby in the stands. I didn't see her again.

When it was suggested that the video looked like he was harassing the woman, Santos replied: 'I don't think it was insisting, it was just fun at the stadium, we were teasing, I didn't go to the stadium to pick up a woman.

'When I say, 'give me your number, give me your number', it's not necessarily because I wanted their number, we were having fun, it's all good.'

Santos then added: 'When I got back to the hotel, I saw the video on all of the social networks. When I saw it, frankly, it saddened me.

'I am a father, I have a family, I would like to take this opportunity to apologise my family, my children, my wife and then I take this opportunity to ask for forgiveness from this lady, her family, her community, her husband, her children, we were having fun and it happened but, frankly, I'm really upset about what happened.'

2024-02-01,Strictly star fuels Bobby Brazier and Ellie Leach rumours with telling photo,"One of the stars of Strictly Come Dancing has added more fuel to the rumours that Bobby Brazier and Ellie Leach have sparked up a romance between them.

A number of the contestants who took part in the BBC series in 2023 are currently on the road travelling across the UK for the live tour.

They include the likes of winners Ellie and Vito Coppola, as well as runners-up Bobby and Dianne Buswell, and Layton Williams and Nikita Kuzmin.

The cast have been keeping their fans updated on all of their antics both on and off the dancefloor, from going on cosy dinner dates to laughing about wigs flying off during routines.

Speculation has recently been growing that Ellie, 22, and Bobby, 20, are actually an item, despite people previously thinking that the Coronation Street actress had started dating her professional partner Vito, 31.

Nikita, 26, has now made fans' theories appear even more validated by sharing an adorable picture of them holding hands.

The pro shared a compilation of backstage photos on his Instagram, several of which were particularly cheeky.

In the first image, Bobby, Layton and Vito joined dancers Robbie Kmetoni and Jake Leigh as they posed for the snap, with Robbie wearing just a pair of underpants with his back facing the camera.

In the fourth photo along, Bobby was seen sitting on a chair with Ellie behind him, the pair gripping each other's hands while beaming with their faces cheek to cheek.

Next to the EastEnders actor, Robbie was sitting on a chair while embracing pro dancer Kai Widdrington.

Strictly viewers couldn't get over the pictures as they commented in their droves underneath the post, with one person called Abs writing: 'These pictures I never thought I needed. Literally thank you for posting these. Just slay it.'

'What happens on tour stays on tour haha,' joked Darren, while Zoe added: 'Backstage looks the best fun.'

Remarking on the picture that featured Ellie and Bobby, Keeks commented: 'Number 4 is so cute.'

Last month, the Strictly stars were spotted in high spirits as they headed out for dinner together, sporting matching bun hairstyles and wrapping up cold as they went to eat at Nando's.

A few days later, Bobby shared a cryptic post on Instagram, writing in his caption: 'With you I have everything.'

Love is in the air this February, but it's not all that's going on. We're falling head over feels with incredible pizza, rustic home-style cooking and very realistic dinosaurs...

By Sophie Laughton

Florist's windows are overgrown with red roses, Clintons looks like Cupid is the new CEO, and every restaurant in London has slapped something pink and heart-shaped on the menu. Yes, Valentine's Day is nearly here, and everyone with a significant other is frantically booking for the 14th. We take a look at the places promising to put you in the mood for luuurve...

The way to most people's hearts is through their stomachs, and London is putting on a real feast. Glitzy Greek restaurant Bacchanalia is looking to the gods for inspiration with an alluring menu finishing with Aphrodite's Embrace, a decadent dessert of vanilla ganache, pink rhubarb, and sweet strawberry sorbet (£26). If a trip to The City of Love is on the cards, Searcys at St Pancras has a £48 set menu packed with Gallic delicacies like duck foie gras to be enjoyed under the neon glow of Tracey Emin's 'I want my time with you' artwork (or just get the oysters, if you know what I mean). And while I know that Germany doesn't have the strongest reputation for romance, German Gymnasium's classy menu - with courses boasting Sekt and oysters, Simmental beef fillet, and a creamy Berliner Luft dessert - might just have you falling in Liebe.

Akub is an idyllic, homely homage to Palestinian land, culture and food. As you walk through the unassuming front door, you're immediately met with a space which embodies the love and nostalgia the owners have for their country. It's a rustic, earthy dining room, lit by cast-iron lanterns and dotted with olive trees which climb the cream-coloured stone walls. But it's the food that transports you across continents. The holy trinity of Palestinian cuisine - sumac, yoghurt and za'atar (imported directly from Palestine) - is ever-present throughout the menu. Our favourites include smooth labaneh balls dressed in turmeric, Aleppo pepper, and sumac; dagga ghazzawieh (chopped tomatoes mixed with green chili, dill, garlic and lemon) as a fresh palette cleanser and crunchy mansaf with tender lamb slow-cooked to perfection. Finish off with barkuk baklawa (a sweet Arabic twist on the classic) with mistika-flavoured ice cream for a unique candy taste that will stay with you long after you've left.

Small plates from £6, large from £14. 27 Uxbridge Street, Notting Hill.

Don't be fooled by the un-prepossessing exterior, Naïfs is one of those cool, quiet, neighbourhood spots that you usually need someone in-the-know (or someone who has read the Michelin guide) to point out. Although Veganuary is now at an end and most chains are quietly relegating their meagre plant-based options back to the bottom of the menu, this family-run restaurant does veggie-only plates all year round. The menu (which changes monthly) is simple and set, and is always served family style. On this month's, find smokey celeriac with onion sauce, and braised white carrots with horseradish cream. Post Veganuary converts - welcome to the family.

Set menu from £30. 56 Goldsmith Road, Peckham.

A round of applause for the worst-named, but most stylish new dining experience in London. The decor is pure luxury: dimly-lit, long mahogany tables, plants dangling from the ceiling and wooden-framed shojis separating diners. The food is presented with the flair and creativity you can expect given the surroundings. We recommend the spicy edamame beans (tangy, sweet, hot - the lot); the obnoxiously large sushi platter with sashimi, nigiri and rolls; marinated lamb rack with kimchi; and, for an absolute show-stopper of a dessert, the natsu platter. One bite of CLAP's matcha cheesecake and you'll even find yourself forgiving the name. Oishii!

Starters from £6, mains from £23. 12-14 Basil Street, Knightsbridge.

If you've already gawped at the giant screens of natural wonders at the BBC Earth Experience, here comes another digital experience celebrating the work of Britain's greatest naturalist - this time aided by virtual reality. Despite the headset, gaming pod and Otherworld's reputation for futuristic, high production value VR adventures, this is not an interactive, 360º experience. In many ways you are just having a 70-minute David Attenborough documentary being directly beamed to your retinas while you sit on a swivel chair in a darkened room. But saying this is a step up from watching Planet Earth II on your laptop is an understatement - soil rumbles under your seat as you're beamed down to bug-size, your stomach lurches as you soar above prehistoric forests. Originally made in 3D for Sky, Sir David's anthology series is heightened to jaw-dropping effect in 8k, his dulcet tones guiding you through an odyssey that sees murderous plants ensnare unwitting insects in viscous glue traps, musical spiders entrance their prey with deadly strums of their web, and iridescenet hummingbirds flutter as they feast on sweet nectar. If you're willing to pay to be fully immersed in Attenborough's world, there's nothing quite like it.

Gliding into London's Pleasance Theatre in an avalanche of sheer fun, is this year's new, hilarious musical. It tells the story of last year's most infamous celebrity court case, when Gwyneth Paltrow faced off against retired optometrist Terry Sanderson over a skiing accident in 2016. The absolute ridiculousness of the trial is mirrored here as an appropriately ridiculous musical spectacle, with some stellar performances from Linus Karp and Joseph Martin. The audience even get to decide the verdict each night. Prepare to piste yourself laughing.","Love is in the air this February, but it's not all that's going on in the capital.

2024-02-01,The Big Bang Theory star blasted for laughing at 'disgusting' Israel-Hamas post,"A The Big Bang Theory star has been condemned for laughing at a comedian's comments about the Israel-Hamas war on social media.

Mayim Bialik, who played neuroscientist Amy Farrah Fowler on the CBS sitcom, was blasted for showing her appreciation for Dan Ahdoot's stand-up routine that was deemed by X users as trivialising the conflict.

Reposting the set next to a clip of her bursting into laughter on her social media sites, the Blossom actress, 48, captioned the post: 'Remixing my reaction to @standupdan because it was making me laugh so hard - I thought you should see how hard I was laughing and maybe you need a laugh from Dan Ahdoot too.'

Bialik, who recently departed as host of Jeopardy! in the US, had turned off the comments on her Instagram and X accounts but her reaction was widely reposted on the latter.

On X, her response sparked huge backlash with Zakwan Khidzir writing: 'This is disgusting behaviour, really. It's sad because TBBT is one of my favourite sitcoms. Amy Farrah Fowler is a hilarious and innocent character, but Mayim Bialik is not.'

Hil added: 'Does Mayim Bialik care to film her reaction to the thousands of videos of people buried under rubble, undergoing surgery without anesthesia, getting their limbs blown off, dead babies in NICUs, people being shot while lining up for aid or no.'

Vangelina Skov, meanwhile, said: 'Didn't expect to see Mayim Bialik laughing about the murder of innocent people and children but I guess everyone I admire turns out to be rotten eventually.'

In Ahdoot's routine, he said: 'Hot take: I think Israel absolutely has the right to exist. Right? I wish I didn't. Honestly, I wish I didn't, because the Palestinian chants are just so much more fun than ours. They're quick, they're snappy, they rhyme.

'Even if you don't agree with them, they're fun to sing.'

Adhoot sang: '""There is only one solution. Intifada, revolution."" I'm like, did DJ Khaled write this?

Referencing the controversial Pro-Palestinian chant and Lil Jon & The East Side Boyz's track Get Low, he continued: '""From the river to sea, Palestine will be free."" I'm like, this is the new ""from the window to the wall.""

Bialik isn't the only celebrity to come under fire for comments made concerning the conflict with Stranger Things star Noah Schnapp previously slammed after sharing a statement shortly after Hamas' attack on Israel on October 7, explaining that he was 'afraid' amid the unrest.

In November, the Will Byers actor was then met with a wave of fury when he liked a video that mocked Muslim people, while also offending the queer community.

In another clip, he could be seen smiling while filming a group of friends, as they showed off labels which read, 'Zionism is sexy' and 'Hamas is ISIS'.

Schnapp later addressed the backlash insisting that his 'thoughts and beliefs have been so far misconstrued' and that he just 'wanted to just state from my heart how I feel'.

Other celebrities including Gal Gadot and Amy Schumer have also spoken out on social media, while Quentin Tarantino visited an Israeli military base.

Gigi Hadid, whose father is Palestinian, was praised for issuing a powerful statement on Instagram, addressing the atrocities.

The conflict began after Hamas' October 7 cross-border attack that killed over 1,200 people and abducted some 250 others.

The offensive has caused widespread destruction, displaced an estimated 85% of Gaza's population and left more than 25,000 Palestinians dead, according to health officials in the Hamas-run territory.

The United Nations and international aid agencies say the fighting has unleashed a humanitarian disaster with a quarter of the area's 2.3 million people facing starvation.

Metro.co.uk has contacted Bialik's rep for comment.

2024-02-01,England youngster set for Test debut against India after visa controversy,"England have made two changes for the second Test against India, with James Anderson returning to the XI and Shoaib Bashir set to make his debut in Visakhapatnam.

Pace bowler Mark Wood and the injured Jack Leach make way, leaving a new-look England attack, as the tourists look to build on their staggering 28-run victory and take a 2-0 lead in this winter's intriguing five-match series.

It's been a sensational rise to the top for the 20-year-old off-spinner Bashir, who only made his first-class debut for Somerset last June.

However, Bashir's experience heading into a dream Test debut has been clouded by visa complications which ruled the youngster out of the opening contest, sparking outrage amongst England's touring party and supporters alike.

Bashir - a British Muslim of Pakistani heritage - was a left-field selection in England's 16-man squad and appeared an outside shot for Hyderabad, where Ollie Pope and Tom Hartley's heroics sealed a famous win.

But that's besides the point. Bashir's paperwork had been with Indian bureaucrats for over six weeks. Why was the spin bowler made to return home and why has his breakthrough been delayed until now?

While a previously uncapped Hartley recovered from a shaky start to emerge with stunning figures of 9 for 193 across India's two innings at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium, Bashir was forced to watch on from the sidelines - no doubt thinking: ""This could have been me!""

Eyebrows were raised when Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes named Bashir in their touring party last month, with fans up and down the country no doubt turning to Google to check out this precocious talent's first-class numbers.

In truth, they won't have found much given the Somerset man has made just six first-class appearances for his county, with a modest record of 10 wickets at 67 and a batting average of 14.20.

It's been a meteoric rise for Bashir, who was plying his trade in Australian club cricket not so long ago after signing professional terms with Somerset in October 2022.

However, Bashir caught the eye on the Lions' tour of the United Arab of Emirates in late 2023, taking six wickets for 42 runs across two innings in convincing fashion versus Afghanistan A.

The Surrey-born off-break bowler, who stands at a towering 6 ft 4 in, spent time with coaches Andrew Flintoff and, crucially, Graeme Swann in the UAE and the latter, arguably England's greatest spinner, sent glowing reports back to England's selectors.

This paved the way for Bashir's first Test call-up, which would have had the youngster dreaming of showcasing his talents and making the difference on India's spin-friendly pitches, where touring teams have so rarely prevailed in recent years.

The Bashir situation is far from an isolated incident in cricket, with players of Pakistani heritage experiencing similarly frustrating delays and hold-ups over recent years.

Lancashire's Saqib Mahmood - who has since been capped by the Test team - was due to travel to India as part of the Lions' limited-overs squad in early 2019, but the fast bowler failed to obtain a visa and was replaced by Tom Bailey.

India's strained relationship with Pakistan had widely been cited as part of the reason for such delays and Tom Harrison, the ECB's then chief executive, said he was 'concerned' and 'very disappointed' that political matters had seemingly punctured the world of sport after Mahmood's ordeal.

Last year, Usman Khawaja also faced a nervous wait for visa approval ahead of Australia's heavyweight series with India, though was eventually cleared to travel and opened the batting in the first Test in Nagpur.

The Pakistan Cricket Board, meanwhile, wrote to the International Cricket Council after visa delays and complications left their players, fans and members of the media in the dark before last year's Cricket World Cup - Pakistan's first trip to India since the T20 World Cup in 2016.

Back in London, Bashir faced an anxious wait to learn whether he would be granted permission travel to India and play a role in the remainder of this winter's series, with the second Test starting on Friday and the fifth and final Test beginning on March 7.

Bashir was forced to stay put at the tourists' training camp, accompanied by the ECB's director of cricket operations Stuart Hooper, before returning home as Stokes and co made their way to Hyderabad.

Thankfully, the news of Bashir's Indian visa being granted broke last Wednesday and the Somerset starlet was able to link up with the rest of the squad in Hyderabad at the weekend.

Bashir could not hide his delight as he was pictured training with his team-mates in Hyderabad, but there would no doubt have been a sense of frustration and disappointment that he was denied the opportunity of playing a part in one of England's all-time great victories.

The youngster will be desperate to make his mark in Vizag and should look no further than fellow newboy Hartley for inspiration after the latter ripped through India's batting line-up on the fourth day and final of the first Test.

Unsurprisingly, Bashir's return home - on the eve of what could otherwise have been the greatest day of his young life - made headlines and drew sympathy from all corners of the cricketing world.

At his pre-match press conference in Hyderabad, Bashir's talismanic skipper, Stokes, said he was 'devastated' his team-mate had been put through such an ordeal.

'When I first found the news out in Abu Dhabi, I did say we shouldn't fly until Bash gets his visa but that was a little bit tongue in cheek,' the England batter told the media.

'I know it's a way bigger thing, doing that. That was probably just my emotions around the whole thing. There was never a chance that we were not going to travel around this but Bash knows he's had our full support.

'I'm pretty devastated that Bash has had to go through this. As a leader, as a captain, when one of your team-mates is affected by something like that you do get a bit emotional.

'I know he's back in London and a lot of people are jumping through hoops to try and get this through quicker. Hopefully we're going to see him here over the weekend.'

Stokes' opposite number, Sharma, expressed his sympathy for the uncapped Englishman and said the situation was 'not easy for anyone'.

'I feel for him, honestly,' the India Test captain told reporters.

'Unfortunately I don't sit in the visa office to give you more details on that but hopefully he can make it quickly, enjoy our country and plays some cricket as well.

'It's not easy for anyone, it could be one of our guys wanting to come to England and being denied.'

Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the government had been clear that they expect all British citizens to be given fair treatment by India's visa processes.

'I can't speak to the specifics of this case. But more broadly we have previously raised issues of this kind with the High Commission,' a Downing Street statement read.

'We have been clear that we expect India to treat British citizens fairly at all times in its visa processes.

'We have previously raised the issues British citizens with Pakistani heritage have experienced.

'We've raised the issues about their experience of applying for visas with the Indian High Commissioner in London.'

2024-02-01,A surprising high street store is giving Primark a run for its money,"Primark has long since been the go-to store for bargain hunters looking for cheap and cheerful fashion and homeware finds.

But now, they've got some competition, as Matalan has revealed it's lowering the price of hundreds of items.

Average prices will fall by an impressive 15% across the shop's everyday family essentials - which include clothes and furnishings.

Matalan's popular beddings sets have also been reduced by £3 across single, double and king sizes. A grey single duvet set at Matalan currently costs £10, while a similar grey set at Primark is £7.

The discounts will be good news for shoppers who want to snap up low-cost items after the financial strain of the festive period.

Matalan bosses say they've been able to make the cuts after making savings elsewhere in the business.

Input costs, meaning what it has to pay suppliers for products and to run its shops, have come down and inflation has slowed.

The lower-cost retailer said it is investing £35 million in cutting the prices of more than 700 products.

Some items will have even bigger price reductions - up to a quarter as part of the price reductions - with the changes taking effect from Monday online and in shops.

Jo Whitfield, Matalan's chief executive, said: 'The start of the year is always a tough time financially and this year, given how difficult 2023 was for so many families, it'll be harder than ever. So, for 2024 we want to start the year off differently.

'We've unlocked efficiencies at a time when inflation and input costs are starting to fall, enabling us to pass these savings on directly to our customers - bringing down the prices of new and existing lines of everyday essentials and favourites across all our key categories.'","Average prices will fall by an impressive 15% across the shop's everyday family essentials.

2024-02-01,"Rolling your eyes could be a sign of sexual discrimination, civil servants told","Government employees have been told if they roll their eyes or look at their phones, it could be considered a sign of sexual or racial discrimination.

A new training for employees which cost more than £160,000 has seen officials told to 'nod their heads' as a way to improve inclusion.

However, feedback from employees who have undergone the training has been incredibly critical.

Former Cabinet minister Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg told the Mail: 'My eyes are rolling at this news - and it is about time for some macro-aggression on behalf of taxpayers who pick up the bill for all this folderol.'

It's estimated around £1,000 per worker was spent by the Department for Education Agency on the training.

The training, held by a private company, first began in 2021, The Times revealed.

Musa al-Gharbi, a sociologist at Stony Brook University in New York state, told them: 'Making people more attentive to small faux pas and unintentional slights, and encouraging minority group members to interpret these as hostile acts indicative of deep-seated racism, sexism or xenophobia -- this is likely to have a negative effect on the wellbeing of the very people it is supposed to help.

'Meanwhile, the perception that people from these populations are highly sensitive, and that majority-group members constantly and aggressively police their every word, thought and gesture, even automatic responses, for fear of being institutionally punished or perceived as a bigot -- this generally leads people from the dominant group to just minimise working with minorities and stick with people you can be yourself around. It reduces co-operation, collaboration and mentorship.'

The definition of microaggressions has also been highly contested.

Google defines it as 'a statement, action, or incident regarded as an instance of indirect, subtle, or unintentional discrimination against members of a marginalized group such as a racial or ethnic minority.'

But some groups in the training were told it was 'verbal or nonverbal snubs (rolling of eyes, looking at your phone whilst someone is speaking to you) ... communicate unfriendly, critical or negative messages'.","officials told to 'nod their heads' as a way to improve inclusion.

2024-02-01,Another Man Utd youngster set to leave on deadline day after rejecting new deal,"Isak Hansen-Aaroen is set to become the latest Manchester United youngster to leave Old Trafford and is close to joining Werder Bremen on transfer deadline day.

The 19-year-old has entered the final six months of his contract in Manchester with United desperate to keep hold of him.

Despite offering him a new four-and-a-half-year deal, the attacking midfielder is frsutrated with a lack of first-team opportunities under Erik ten Hag. The deal on the table is also thought to 'not come close' to those offered elsewhere.

According to Sky Germany, Hansen-Aaroen is now close to joining Werder Bremen on a permanent deal with United giving the green light for him to complete the move.

Despite training with the first-team on a number of occasions, c was not included in the squad that took on Wigan Athletic in the third round of the FA Cup on Monday, despite a spate of injury and illness absences with two goalkeepers named on the bench.

Willy Kambwala and Omari Forson were given chances off the bench against the Latics with Shola Shoretire, Joe Hugill and Rhys Bennett unused substitutes.

He also failed to make the squad for the fourth round clash against Newport County with Forson again getting the nod in attack.

The Norwegian teenager, who joined United from Tromso in 2020, caught ten Hag's eye during a pre-season fixture against Leeds in Oslo but is set to leave Old Trafford without making a senior appearance.

He did well,' ten Hag said last July. 'He had a good pass on the first goal.

'You can see that he is very comfortable with the ball. He has good vision and good scanning.

'He is of course a young player. He has some small things to work on. But we want to tell him that, show him and then work with him to get the right movements in.'

Hansen-Aaroen will become the latest United youngster to leave this club. Hannibal Mejbri and Alvaro Fernandez have joined Sevilla and Benfica respectively on loan deals which include permanent options at the end of the season.

Facundo Pellistri meanwhile has joined Granada on loan with his agent accusing ten Hag of 'not valuing' the winger with his long-term future in Manchester looking bleak.

2024-02-01,Shock passion as EastEnders characters kiss after two traumas,"This article contains spoilers from Thursday's (February 1) episode of EastEnders, which has not yet aired on TV but is available to watch now on BBC iPlayer.

Best friends Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) and Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) have both been going through tough times in recent months, with things coming to a head this week.

Alfie was let down by Linda earlier in the week when she bailed on accompanying him to his prostate cancer treatment, though she later made up for it by organising a lads night for him at the Vic.

However, things ended in disaster for poor Alfie when he had an accident in from of everybody, leaving him feeling humiliated.

Thankfully, his friends were understanding, especially after he finally revealed his diagnosis to them.

At the same time, Linda has also been suffering, after killing Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters) on Christmas Day.

This week, things got even worse when she was sent a photo of Mick Carter and Janine Butcher's son, and was hit by a new wave of grief for her childhood sweetheart.

It didn't take long for Linda to hit the bottle again, and thankfully Alfie was there to pick up the pieces when she was thrown out of The Albert, however, he wasn't prepared for what she would say next.

In her drunken, grieving state, Linda cried about how she wanted to drink herself to death because of what she had 'done to him at Christmas', leaving Alfie both horrified and confused.

Concerned for her wellbeing, Alfie recounted the conversation to Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner), who later urged Linda to go and put things right.

Terrified that the other members of The Six would find out what she had let slip and turn on her, Linda headed back to Alfie's flat to try and convince him that the man she had been referring to was Mick.

Linda explained how she blamed herself for what happened to Mick on Christmas Day 2022, revealing that she was still tormented by it.

Alfie seemed convinced by her story, but when she attempted to leave, he refused to let her go until he could convince her that she was a good person.

He revealed that she had been a huge support to him over the past few months, and continued to shower her in compliments, before Linda shocked him by leaning in for a passionate kiss.

Is this the start of Linda and Alfie being more than just friends?

The father-daughter duo mingled with a star-studded guestlist from across the creative industries at the swanky pre-Bafta Film Awards affair, held at Pavyllon London at Four Seasons Hotel London at Park Lane.

Phoebe, who has been kept out of the spotlight by her protective parents, looked stunning after opting for a metallic silvery sheath cocktail dress.

She paired it with strappy white heels, a collection of bangles and a black clutch bag, keeping her blonde hair loose.

Meanwhile, BBC Radio 2 host Vernon, 49, looked dapper in a black evening suit with silk lapels and a black shirt worn open at the collar.

He and Strictly Come Dancing co-presenter Tess, 54, also share youngest daughter Amber, 14.

They celebrated their 20th wedding anniversary in September, having tied the knot back in 2003.

Phoebe made her red carpet debut, also alongside her dad, last year at the John Wick: Chapter 4 UK premiere in March, rocking a pair of black pleather trousers with split hems.

In August, he and Tess took Phoebe out to celebrate her A-level results together at the Ivy Asia in Manchester's Spinningfields, after she spent the last several years focused on her schoolwork and studies.

Other famous youngsters at the pre-Baftas party, which is held to celebrate the only category at the EE Bafta Film Awards voted for by the public, included Mel B's daughter Phoenix Chi Brown.

The 24-year-old DJ looked super-stylish in a black skirt and cream distressed jacket, which she wore with a black tie, and hopped on the decks during the course of the evening.

The party honoured Rising Star nominees Jacob Elordi, Phoebe Dynevor, Ayo Edebiri, Mia McKenna-Bruce and Sophie Wilde, with Mia and Sophie in attendance.

Other guests included Sanditon star Rose Williams, comedian Katherine Ryan, singer Paloma Faith, radio star Vick Hope and former Strictly champion Rose Ayling-Ellis.

Several of the cast of Netflix's Heartstopper were in attendance, as well as Aisling Bea, actress Kaya Scodelario, Emma and Matt Willis and former girl band singers Nicola Roberts and Frankie Bridge.

The Bafta Film Awards, hosted by David Tennant, are set to take place at the Southbank Centre's Royal Festival Hall and broadcast on BBC One and iPlayer on Sunday February 18.

2024-02-01,The dark side of the Instagram massage gun craze,"Before you reach for a massage gun to ease your neck pain, you may want to heed this warning.

Fitness influencer Sophie Sanguedolce recently shared a TikTok detailing her experience, which she says left her in severe pain and needing urgent care.

In the video - captioned 'why to not use a massage gun on your neck EVER' - Sophie claims she woke one morning with a kink in her neck, and decided to use a massage gun to ease the pain.

From 8am that day she says she was using the device on a high setting on her neck and upper back every 30 minutes, finding temporary relief each time she did. But by 5pm, the area had become 'super sore, red, and inflamed'.

When she woke up the next morning, the pain was worse, and Sophie noticed a lump protruding from the side of her neck. It wouldn't go down, so she stopped by her local urgent care, where staff gave her a stark warning about the at-home remedy.

'My doctor was like, don't you dare ever use a massage gun on your neck,' Sophie said.

'She said she had a patient recently who was using it on her neck - she would have a lot of pain from carrying her baby. You've got your jugular and carotid artery here, so if you use it on your neck it can actually stop the blood flow from going to your brain. And her patient was having strokes.'

Sophie explained that while her doctor believed she simply had an inflamed lymph node, she wanted to share the advice to ensure others would stay safe and avoid more serious consequences.

Unfortunately, many responded saying they'd already experienced health issues as a result of massagers.

'Not me having a mystery stroke at 28 and constantly using a massage gun on my neck,' wrote @rupaulrudd, while @drivera_77 said: 'I developed rhabdomyolysis [a rare muscle injury where your muscles break down that can be triggered by injury] due to using a massage gun on my arm.'

'Yes! My aunt had a stroke from her massage gun,' added @ellierinehart.

Vibrational massage has been practiced for centuries, but modern technology has greatly advanced the field. At-home machines offering localised percussive therapy were first released in 2008, and became popular thanks to endorsements from sports stars (including NBA player Kyrie Irving). Fitness Instagram then introduced these guns to a whole new audience, cementing them as a must have for gymfluencers and health fanatics alike.

Although Sophie's story, and those shared in the comments of her video, sound extreme, there are a number of risks associated with improperly using a massage gun.

GP and author Dr Philippa Kaye tells Metro.co.uk: 'When you use one of those guns, which has got a lot of pressure and can pulse, the concern is that you can temporarily disrupt the flow of blood to the brain.

'This could then cause a stroke or stroke-like symptoms; things like slurred speech, not being able to move, becoming confused, weakness on one side of the body or a severe headache.'

This can be due to something called vertebral artery dissection, a form of blood clot which may also occur after other injuries (such as car accidents) or as a result of sudden trauma to the neck (such as chiropractic adjustments or lifting heavy weights).

According to Dr Philippa, applying a massage gun to the neck can also 'cause inflammation of the lymph nodes' - as it did in Sophie's case - and using the device too often or with too much pressure can lead to bruising, swelling, or soft tissue injury.'

She advises keeping the gun to the shoulders and back, adding: 'That's different to the base of the skull or the side or front of the neck, which is where I'd consider it to be more dangerous.'

If you're concerned about neck or shoulder pain and particularly if you're experiencing any neurological symptoms like weakness or pins and needles, get it checked out by a medical professional.

It's also important to ensure the device you have is safe, as some models were recently recalled over safety issues, with US authorities claiming they could catch fire and pose a burn risk.

You don't need to throw your massage gun in the bin, but do ensure you're using it as safely as possible.

Personal trainer Jamie Barnard of PMPT has seen clients exacerbate previous injuries by getting too trigger happy with theirs, advising massage gun usage in moderation alongside other methods like foam rolling and stretching.

He tells Metro.co.uk: 'The best way to start using a massage gun is to set the vibration to low and begin with applying little pressure before slowly building up resistance.

'Be careful of the amount of pressure being applied and avoid staying on a single area for a prolonged amount of time.

'If you experience any pain, discomfort or unusual symptoms stop using immediately and seek professional advice.'

Neck pain can be down to a number of factors, so it's often best to speak to a specialist before trying to DIY a treatment.

'My advice would be tailored according to the client's pain,' says Jamie. 'If they were experiencing muscular pain due to exercise - also known as Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS) - I would recommend some light stretching and epsom salts which are good for relaxing the muscles.

'With trained advice the use of a massage gun around the upper back or shoulders could also help alleviate tension in these areas, but if the pain persists, I would always recommend seeing either a physio, osteopath, chiropractor or massage therapist.'","Fitness influencer Sophie Sanguedolce recently shared a TikTok detailing her experience.

2024-02-01,Girl falls 30ft off ski lift after slipping out of seat,"This is the chilling moment a snowboarder plunged more than 30 feet off a ski lift, landing on the ground.

Footage shared on Instagram shows the 16-year-old girl dangling from the chair for a few minutes at Mammoth Mountain, in California.

Employees can be seen holding a 'deceleration net' to help cushion her fall and eventually, she is seen falling down.

Other skiers at the resort, on the edge of the Sierra Nevada, could only hope for the best as they watched the situation unravel in front of them.

They can be heard gasping in horror as a big 'thud' sound is heard from the girl's fall.

Unfortunately, the net did not fully protect her from the impact with the ground and the victim was rushed to hospital.

The full extent of her injuries from Saturday's incident are not yet confirmed.

The resort said the girl had been sitting incorrectly as the lift set off and began 'sliding off' the chair.

Other riders were seen holding on to her but were apparently unable to pull her back up.

Meanwhile, skiers accused the lift operators of not paying attention and 'missing catching her'.

An Instagram user who shared the video wrote in the caption: 'Ski patrol failed this girl today, totally missing catching her with the net after convincing her everything was okay!

'Telling her Just to jump already I heard the ski patrol say they've never done this before and was way under experienced for this situation!'

A spokesperson from the mountain operator said the net decelerated the girl's fall, but 'did not stop it'.

'Five Mammoth Mountain employees and eight guests immediately responded and positioned the deceleration net under the guest,' a statement cited by ABC said.

'When the guest slipped from the grasp of her chair mates, the net decelerated her fall, but did not stop it.

'The guest was transported to Mammoth Hospital for evaluation. Our thoughts are with the guest and her family.'","Footage shared on Instagram shows the 16-year-old girl dangling from the chair.

2024-02-01,Lewis Hamilton set to quit Mercedes and make shock move to Ferrari,"Lewis Hamilton is set to make a shock move to Ferrari for the 2025 season and end his long-standing association with Mercedes.

The seven-times world champion has been with his current team since 2013 and appeared to have put to bed speculation surrounding his future last year by signing a new contract.

Speaking at the time, Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff said: 'Our partnership with Lewis is one of the most successful in the sport's history. It was always a formality that we would continue together - and it's energising for us all to be confirming that publicly.

'His qualities as a pure racing driver are illustrated by his remarkable track record, but over our years together, he has grown to become a pillar and leader of our team. Those leadership qualities are crucial as we focus on fighting for world championships again.

'As F1's biggest global star, he has also played a key role in shaping our commitments to diversity, inclusion and sustainability, that will be foundations for our success in the years ahead.'

2024-02-01,Pokimane says she left Twitch for YouTube because of male toxicity,"Twitch star Pokimane has revealed she's leaving Twitch to start a YouTube stream and seek more independence from the 'manosphere' community.

On Wednesday, one of Twitch's most popular, and longest serving, streamers announced that they are leaving the platform after 10 years, but Pokimane didn't say what she would do next.

Her goodbye tweet sparked debate about whether she was signing for rival Kick, moving to YouTube, or retiring entirely.

Less than 24 hours later, Pokimane has revealed that she is starting a new YouTube stream and her reasons why do not paint Twitch in a good light.

Pokimane announced the news on Twitter, saying, 'Let's explore something new together. No strings attached. First ever YouTube stream tomorrow.'

She then pointed people in the direction of her podcast, where she went into detail about why she left Twitch, saying she wanted to be more independent with her content and explore new things:

'Over the last year I've been doing a lot of different things and, frankly, missing out on a lot of money I could have made. But that is 100% my choice that I'm making for myself, for my happiness, and for my long-term career growth,' she said.

She added that exclusivity deals, which until recently she had with Twitch, are a double-edged sword, even if they provide a minimum amount of income as long as you 'hit your targets', such as hours streamed per month.

However, there's a downside, Pokimane revealed, which is that 'they do put you in this head space of prioritising hours streamed versus how good the content actually is. Or putting effort into other platforms, or doing other things.'

Pokimane quoted Twitch CEO Dan Clancy, who admitted the platform isn't profitable, and that 'putting all your eggs in on backet isn't always great, especially once you start seeing that that basket isn't doing as well as it was doing before.'

She suggested the community landscape of Twitch, which remains dominated by male streamers,' was also a factor in her leaving Twitch, saying:

'For the last couple of years, is it just me or do you guys also feel like it has regressed a lot? Especially with the rise of so much manosphere, red pill, bulls***. I feel like that stuff has flourished within the male-dominated live streaming sphere. I can't be surprised. It's the online demographic that skews males the most, so of course manosphere stuff would perform better there.

'But it was just disappointing seeing this community and industry that I have so much love for relish, almost, in this s***. So many of the things I see... figureheads in my industry, the most popular, well established, typically male, creators... some of the stuff I see them say and do breaks my heart. It's hard for me to exist in a community and watch that happen.'

At the end of the day, leaving Twitch was never likely to be a big problem for Pokimane. She has 5.9 million followers on Instagram, 6.7 million followers on TikTok, and 6.6 million subscribers on her main YouTube channel and a large proportion will almost certainly follow her wherever she goes.

2024-02-01,Coronation Street star 'feared she would die' in terrifying home invasion,"Coronation Street star Stephanie Beacham revealed she feared for her safety after being burgled in her home.

Last year the actress, known for her role as Martha Fraser and starring alongside Dame Joan Collins in the 80s series Dynasty, was forced to hand over money and jewellery after David Wilson broke into her home.

It is said that Wilson raised a jemmy - a bar with a claw at the end - in front of Stephanie and told her 'don't look at me.'

During Tuesday's (January 30) Good Morning Britain Stephanie opened up about the frightening ordeal.

'There I am, it's Sunday afternoon - you don't get burgled on a Sunday afternoon, do you?' she said.

'Luckily I was dressed for gardening, which meant I had a really dodgy jumper on and no jewellery and probably didn't look very much like moi.

'Anyway, I heard a noise downstairs and I thought, 'Well, must be I've got an assistant, a friend'. Then I said, 'Hello?' and I looked over [and] there he was.'

She added: 'There it was - crowbar over my head, and then the corny dialogue, ""Give me your money, give me your jewellery, don't look at me. I wish you weren't here.""'

She continued on the ITV morning show that she believed she was going to die and claimed she was 'an absolute wimp, total wimp. And I gave him my money.'

In February 2023, Wilson pleaded guilty to aggravated burglary over the break-in last year, and a separate ordeal back in 2021.

'During the course of this incident, which was terrifying for Ms Beacham, when in the circumstances of which she found herself, she had real fears for her life', Prosecutor John Traversi told Southward Crown Court.

He was sentenced to 10 years and five months.

The court also discovered that Stephanie has since doubled her sleeping medication, regularly experiences nightmares, panic attacks and won't walk her dog after dark.

'He ran up towards her holding up to her face what he saw as a metal bar with a claw at the end, some two feet in length, and what she described as undoubtedly a jemmy, as used by burglars since time immemorial to gain access to properties and steal therein', Traversi added, describing the moment Wilson broke in.

Stephanie reprised her role as Martha Fraser in Coronation Street last year.

She returned to the cobbles to help out with a local AmDram play, but found herself questioning her feelings for Ken Barlow (William Roache), who she had an affair with back in the day.

2024-02-01,Chelsea lower Armando Broja demands on Deadline Day,"Chelsea will now accept loan offers for Armando Broja, with the club desperate to get the striker off the books on Deadline Day.

The Blues had initially been seeking a £50million fee for Broja but the likes of Fulham and Crystal Palace deemed that excessive.

Chelsea need to balance the books at Stamford Bridge following their unprecedented spending over the last two years.

The 22-year-old is a Chelsea academy product and the club could therefore use the entirety of any fee they get for him to reinvest, in line with Profit and Sustainability rules.

But, after rejecting a bid from Wolves, Chelsea have now lowered their demands according to the Athletic.

The club will now accept a 'significant' loan fee in order for clubs to sign Broja for the remainder of the season.

Chelsea will also accept an obligation to buy, provided its at the right price.

Broja was an unused substitute in the side's 4-1 defeat to Liverpool on Wednesday.

He returned from nine months out with an ACL injury earlier this season.

2024-02-01,Buying bigger packs might not actually be saving you money,"When you're at the supermarket and you pick up large packets of items like toilet roll, laundry detergent pods and ketchup, you may assume bigger packs means more value.

However a closer look at unit pricing on these items suggest otherwise.

The watchdog Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has published findings after examining 26 everyday essentials and found examples of when shoppers had not scooped a bigger deal by relying on a 'rule of thumb' assumption about what is the best value by size.

This assumption is, in fact, not always correct and could lead to you paying more per unit.

In its first release of analysis from its investigation, the CMA said: 'While it was usual for bigger packs to have a lower unit price than smaller packs, this wasn't always true. We saw examples in our basket of groceries of larger packs having higher unit prices.'

Unit pricing is a labelling system for displaying the cost of different products to standard units of weight and volume.

It's meant to help shoppers compare the relative costs of products, irrespective of their size, to work out which product is the best value for the shopper's needs.

However, the CMA research has revealed that there isn't much awareness about what unit pricing is and that it tends to compete with promotions and special offer notices for a shopper's attention.

While products on promotion generally were cheaper than those that were not, there were some products, including ketchup and laundry detergent packs, when discounted 'had an equal or more expensive unit price than alternative pack sizes which were not on promotion'.

There were also some multipack items, including mayonnaise, which were more pricey for each unit than other packs that were not on promotion.

The CMA shared: 'Our pricing analysis highlights the value of unit pricing when comparing between grocery items - revealing that shoppers' commonly held assumptions about what products are cheapest on a per unit basis aren't always right and that the pricing of some products relative to others can be surprising.'

To ensure you get the best deals, Victoria Leyton, a consumer expert at hotukdeals.com and host of False Economy podcast, tells Metro.co.uk that it is important to look at the unit price on the shelf before purchasing a bigger pack.

This will give you a cost you can compare to full price individual, smaller batch products and promotional offers.

On how supermarkets can make unit pricing clearer, Victoria says unfortunately it is currently as clear as it will get.

She adds: 'Highlighting a deal that isn't great value is unlikely to be a priority for shops looking to nudge people into spending a little bit more, which is why it is on the consumer to look closely.

'If you need one, buying one at full price is better for your bank balance than buying three.'

The CMA investigation comes as shoppers face big changes with various loyalty schemes potentially coming to an end.

The watchdog said it would investigate whether the schemes, such as Tesco's Clubcard and the Nectar card from Sainsbury's, really offer a good deal.

Alarms have been raised about the two-tier pricing currently offered by retailers like Boots and Tesco - where members pay less for certain products - with 'a number of questions about the impact of loyalty pricing on consumers and competition.'

Its review will assess whether non-members are being unfairly shortchanged by the schemes, as well as their impact on shoppers' ability to compare prices.

'It's easy to be tripped up by loyalty schemes,' Vanessa explains, arguing that being 'disloyal' is what shoppers should be.

'When [loyalty schemes were] initially pioneered by Clubcard, it was a small selection of deep discounts on things like premium brand coffee, bringing them down to affordable prices.

'As time has gone on and it has been adopted more widely by the big four, it has become easier to exploit the remembered early buzz of big discounts with the actual discounts getting more shallow.

'For some items it might be more of a case of allowing you to level up brand wise, rather than bring down the cost of your shop. There are still deals to be found and it is worth checking across all supermarkets accessible to you - be disloyal - but you shouldn't assume loyalty prices are the best you can do.'

Yiannis Zourmpanos, a finance expert and chartered certified accountant, tells Metro.co.uk that the investigation into loyalty schemes is 'wise'.

He adds: 'While reward programs foster customer engagement when structured well, there is cause for concern if they skew shoppers' perceptions or disadvantage certain groups. Supermarkets must ensure discount claims stand up to scrutiny.

'Pricing practices should prioritise transparency to empower informed choice. If done right, both retailers and consumers can benefit through building commitment and trust over time. But fairness and clarity must come first to protect all shoppers.'",Unit pricing is a labelling system for displaying the cost of different products to standard units of weight and volume.

2024-02-01,Map shows exact location Clapham 'acid' attack unfolded,"The Met confirmed a 31-year-old woman and her two daughters, aged eight and three were taken to hospital with 'potentially life changing injuries' after the attack on Lessar Avenue, just yards away from Clapham Common.

Three other adults and police officers who were thought to have come to their aid were also taken to hospital.

Superintendent Gabriel Cameron confirmed this morning that the substance used in the attack was an alkaline.

Supt Cameron added: 'Three women - two in their 30s and one in her 50s - who were injured when they bravely came to the aid of the family, have all been discharged from hospital with minor burns injuries.

'A man in his 50s who also helped declined hospital treatment for minor injuries he suffered.

'Five officers who were injured as they responded have all been treated and have left hospital.

'All these members of the public, and my officers, deserve enormous recognition and praise for coming to the aid of this woman and children in what must have been a terrifying scenario. We will provide them with all the support we can.

'I also want to commend nearby hotel staff after victims and officers sought refuge and water there following the incident.'

Officers are searching for a man seen fleeing the scene towards Clapham Common, assisted by a police helicopter.

The Metropolitan Police say they believe the man and woman knew each other and described the attack as 'targeted'.

CCTV footage shows the suspect ramming his car into someone before throwing a child onto the ground.

A couple who live on the street say they ran outside after hearing a cry for help and a car crashing.

The man said: 'We came outside and saw this guy and he took a girl out of the car and he slammed her to the ground twice.

'I chased him half way down the road, but I was in slippers so didn't get very far.

'As I came back, that's when I saw the woman who had been attacked, so I ran inside to get some water and just sprayed her down with water.'

Another witness who tried to wash the chemical off the woman's face told Sky News: 'It was horrific. First a man grabbed a kid - a girl aged two or three from a white car.

'He threw her onto the floor - twice! It was the worst thing I've ever seen.

'I then ran into my house, grabbed a water bottle and threw water on her eyes. Her lips were black. Her skin looked burnt.'

2024-02-01,Is The Traitors in jeopardy? The truth behind Claudia Winkleman's 'move',"Strictly Come Dancing presenter Claudia Winkleman is said to be being poached by ITV for a six-figure deal, according to reports.

It's been claimed that bosses are looking to steal The Traitors star, 52, to front a Saturday evening programme over on ITV - though she would still be fronting her major roles on BBC One.

A source had said: 'ITV very much see Claudia as the presenter of the moment. She's smart, fun, witty, hard-working and is so sharp she's considered a safe pair of hands when it comes to live TV.

'That means she could pretty much tackle any project bosses could throw at her, and it might offer her the next step up in her stellar career.'

The insider insisted to The Sun that there's 'no suggestion' that Claudia will quit Strictly, but ITV bosses would offer her 'at least £500,000'.

However, Metro.co.uk can confirm, thankfully, Claudia's roles on The Traitors and Strictly are pretty safe.

We understand that no conversations have taken place about Claudia being poached by ITV.

Meanwhile, despite criticism over the broadcaster's male-heavy presenting line-up and claims the channel is trying to boost its number of female presenters, an ITV spokesperson has insisted they have 'a broad roster of female on screen talent'.

Saturday night entertainment programmes on ITV are male-dominated, and earlier this month saw The Chase Celebrity Special (Bradley Walsh), followed by the Wheel of Fortune (Graham Norton), The Masked Singer (Joel Dommett), Ant & Dec's Limitless Win (Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly), Bradley & Barney Walsh: Breaking Dad, and finally Big Zuu's 12 Dishes in 12 Hours.

Following The Sun's claims, an ITV spokesperson told Metro.co.uk: 'We have a broad roster of female on screen talent across our entire daytime and primetime schedules, and a number of our biggest formats, including Love Island, Big Brother, The Voice UK, Dancing on Ice, My Mum Your Dad and Soccer Aid are hosted or co-hosted by female presenters.

'Additionally, big weekend shows such as The Masked Singer, Britain's Got Talent, The Voice UK and Dancing on Ice feature female talent in prominent on screen judging roles.

'In the last year, we have broadcast shows including An Audience with Kylie Minogue, Mamma Mia I Have A Dream hosted by Zoe Ball and featuring three females on the judging panel, as well as the Olivier Awards and British Soap Awards which were both hosted by female presenters.'

Possible demand for Claudia to front more programmes comes after The Traitors finale's roaring success.

Of course, that made it the most-watched programme on TV of that last week (since Monday), and beat the season one final last year which reached 3.1m.

The Traitors is available to watch on BBC iPlayer.

2024-02-01,Justin Timberlake makes 'disgusting' comment on stage 'aimed at Britney Spears',"Justin Timberlake just well and truly ruffled the feathers of Britney Spears fans all over the world.

While performing on stage in New York City last night to an intimate crowd, he was videoed seemingly taking aim at ex Britney Spears.

'I'd like to take this chance to apologise, to absolutely f***ing nobody,' he announced into the microphone between songs.

That doesn't seem so bad on first appearances. But fans reckon the comment was, shall we say, very loaded, given only days ago Britney publicly apologised to Justin.

Britney's apology came after she called out the SexyBack hitmaker, 43, in her memoir The Woman In Me - released in October - on his alleged behaviour in their high-profile noughties relationship.

In it, the Toxic popstar, 42, claimed Justin pressured her into having an abortion when she became pregnant with his child.

Following their 2002 break up, which Britney said Justin did over a text, he released Cry Me A River - his biggest hit - which showed a blonde woman cheating on a man.

Britney reflected on this time in her book, and said she was painted as the 'harlot' who broke the heart of 'America's golden boy'.

In reality, Britney - who owned up to cheating rumours - said she was 'comatose in Louisiana' while he was 'happily running around Hollywood'.

This is despite, Britney claims, Justin having cheated on her 'multiple' times throughout their relationship.

Fans were appalled at these revelations and many have criticised Justin in the wake of the book release, and they were even more appalled when Britney took to social media days ago to apologise to Justin.

'If I offended any of the people I genuinely care about I am deeply sorry... I also wanted to say I am in love with Justin Timberlake's new song ""Selfish"" 🌹 It is soo good,' she wrote on social media.

She praised the former *NSYNC member's new solo track Selfish, despite her fans calling it a direct snub to the Gimme More singer, as its name is the same as Britney's 2011 track.

In response, Britney fans - a historically dedicated bunch - got her 13-year-old Femme Fatale cut track to the top of the iTunes charts, with Justin's Selfish trailing behind. What a flex.

So given all this history and Britney's apology a mere 48 hours before, fans took Justin's defiant words at the New York concert as unashamed shade towards his ex.

'Absolutely disgusting that in 2024 and after Britney literally promoted his trashy song, this a**hole Justin Timberlake is shading her,' X user @britboy18 wrote alongside the video.

They continued: 'Britney didn't even need to apologize about her single outselling and out-charting his comeback but here he is being a sore loser as always.'

'And ppl say Britney talks about him too much.. he legit shades her every time he performs this song,' @SeanRyanKC wrote.

'Can this man hit a new low? Seems unlikely,' added @hleb91.

User @officalmro wrote: 'This kind of ""I don't care"" attitude is only cute when you've actually done nothing wrong.'

Meanwhile, @RamonLevit said: 'Drop this attitude, society has been too kind and tolerant with this man. Own up to your faults , be genuine, be humble, and that's how you crawl back to success.'

Another fan said he made the apology right before singing Cry Me A River - the song Britney described as having 'shattered' her on its release in 2002.

'May I just say that on his explosive album and in all the press that surrounded it, Justin neglected to mention the several times he'd cheated on me?' Britney wrote in her book about Justin's biggest hit.

'There's always more leeway in Hollywood for men than for women. And I see how men are encouraged to talk trash about women in order to become famous and powerful. But I was shattered.'

This gig comes almost exactly 20 years after Justin's Super Bowl controversy, when he exposed Janet Jackson's breast instead of her bra in their half time performance on February 1, 2004.

In alignment with Britney's claims about the difference in treatment between men and women in the noughties, Janet, 57, was vilified and 'Nipplegate' almost ended her career. Meanwhile, Justin carried on living his life in the spotlight as normal.

In 2021, after the release of documentary Framing Britney Spears, Justin apoogised to both Britney and Janet for times his 'actions have contributed to the problem' of misogyny and racism.

Taking to social media he said: 'I am deeply sorry for the times in my life where my actions contributed to the problem, where I spoke out of turn, or did not speak up for what was right.'

He continued: 'I understand that I fell short in these moments and in many others and benefited from a system that condones misogyny and racism.'

2024-02-01,Bricklayer calmly packs up moments after beating customer to death with hammer,"A bricklayer was filmed whistling as he calmly packed away his tools after bludgeoning a customer to death in a row over 'chronic' delays to extension works at her home.

Cowboy builder Peter Norgrove, 43, repeatedly smashed Sharon Gordon, 58, over the head with a hammer when she complained about how long he was taking to complete the job last July.

He left her dying at the bottom of her stairs in Dudley, West Midlands, and hours later led a service for worshippers at the Jehovah's Witnesses Kingdom Hall through which they met via a friend.

Norgrove, from Sedgley, pleaded guilty to Mrs Gordon's murder at Wolverhampton Crown Court and was jailed for life with a minimum term of 14 years.

The court heard she hired newly-qualified Norgrove to build a ground-floor extension, paying him £29,000 in instalments for what was envisioned to be two months' work.

But the job ended up dragging on for more than a year and still was not finished by the time of the killing on July 20.

Mrs Gordon suffered at least eight blows to the head during what the judge called a 'brutal and savage' attack.

Norgrove's movements outside her home that day were captured on doorbell and security cameras.

The court heard two friends visited Mrs Gordon that afternoon and criticised the building work.

Shortly after they left, Norgrove could be seen pulling on a pair of red gloves.

Prosecutor Earl Pinnock told the court that camera footage showed him going inside through the back door wearing the rubber gloves.

He told the court: 'At 2.02pm the Ring doorbell recorded noises. They last for a duration of 18 seconds.

'A female voice screamed momentarily and then shouted something inaudible.'

Around 20 minutes later it captures him leaving again with blood visible on his right leg. He then carries on packing away his tools, whistling as he goes, and then driving off.

During sentencing, Judge Michael Chambers KC said Mrs Gordon may have lived for up to an hour after the attack.

The court heard bloodstained items were later found in a wheelie bin at a family address linked to Norgrove and further searches revealed a hammer hidden in a shed at the victim's home.

Norgrove started the building work in April 2022 and the court heard that by the following January it was 'clear there was a steady reduction in her trust and confidence in him'.

Mr Pinnock said the relationship 'soured further' over the following weeks.

He added that the 'pattern of irregular attendance, dissatisfaction and mutual distrust continued into the summer'.

The judge told Norgrove: 'What was clear was by that Thursday, July 20, Sharon Gordon continued to criticise you as to the delays and standard of your work.

'That clearly was the motivation for your anger. You went into the house, having put gloves on.

'You used a hammer to repeatedly strike her to the head. You made no attempts to seek help.

'No sentence I can impose can put the clock back, nor should it be seen as any attempt to put a value on the loss of a human life.

'The principal aggravating factor is this was a brutal and savage attack in the victim's home, using a weapon. She would have been no match for you.

'There was clearly an intention to kill.'

Detective Inspector Damian Forrest, who led the investigation, said: 'Mrs Gordon tragically lost her life following a violent attack by Peter Norgrove, which appears to have stemmed from him losing his temper after a disagreement over the work he was carrying out.

'Mrs Gordon's friends and family have been deeply affected by her death, and while Norgrove has now faced the consequences of his appalling actions, our thoughts remain with them as they continue to grieve.'

Victim impact statements read to the court by friends and family members described the murder as an incomprehensible 'atrocity' which took the life of a generous and kind woman with strong faith and values.

The victim's daughter, Rhian Brown, told the court prior to the sentencing: 'This man's actions have changed my life forever.

'I am tormented at the thought of what my mum endured. Did she cry out for someone? Those thoughts are torture but I can't get them out of my head.

'In her final moments she was faced with shocking violence from someone she thought she could trust. Nothing will ever restore or compensate for what we have lost.'","Peter Norgrove, 43, repeatedly smashed Sharon Gordon, 58, over the head with a hammer.

You don't need to spend loads for a sunny escape either. This month, flights to some of the hottest destinations in the world are far cheaper than during the summer months - return fares start from just £28.

So, where in the world should you jet off to in February for gorgeous weather and plenty of sunshine? Here are a few bright ideas.

In a Spanish archipelago off the coast of Africa, Tenerife is one of seven perfectly-positioned Canary Islands for a warm February holiday.

Base yourself in buzzy Puerto de la Cruz, less than half a mile from Playa Jardín, one of the island's most beautiful beaches, known for its volcanic black sand.

The island is also home to Loro Parque, considered the world's best zoo.

But if you prefer to see animals in their natural habitats, Tenerife is Europe's first Whale Heritage Site - the coastal strip between Tenerife and La Gomera is a sanctuary for them.

Head inland and you'll find a lunar-like landscape of lava beds, jagged escarpments and ravines - the adventurous can hike up the 3,718m high Mount Teide, or take a cable car.

In February, highs of around 30°C are possible. But you can still expect it to be hot and sunny in the 20s regardless. Better still: it'll be balmy at night, so you hopefully you won't need to wrap up.

Choosing where in Mexico to go is the real conundrum, but the city of Cancun, bordering on the Caribbean sea, naturally ticks the 'beach holiday' box.

For a bit of culture, travel along the Yucatán Peninsula to Tulum, where there are well-preserved ruins with a beach!

If an off-beat city break is more your bag, look up Oaxaca in the south-west or San Miguel de Allende in the Central Highlands.

If you're up for being active, there's plenty to do in Lanzarote - such as exploring Cuevas de los Verdes (caves) and surfing at Famara Beach.

Again, it's another place where you have several options for how to spend your trip: lay on the golden beaches for a week straight, or combine your time on the coast with a bit of adventure.

The capital city, Bridgetown, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, with a fascinating museum about the nation's history and a bustling shopping street.

Wherever you go, you'll likely come across amazing food, vibrant nightlife and an abundance of water sports to try.

The fragrant smell of street food is probably the first thing that comes to mind when you imagine Singapore.

Or perhaps it's the whoosh of Changi Airport's show-stopping waterfall.

A trip to the South-East Asian city-state wouldn't be complete without a wander through the futuristic-looking Gardens By The Bay or a trip to shopping hotspot Clarke Quay.

OK, so it's probably not the first place you'd think of when you imagine going on a hot holiday in February, but make no mistake - you'll definitely feel the heat in Singapore.

February is slap-bang in the middle of its driest season (December to April), and promises soaring temperatures and minimal rainfall.

Fiji is nearly 10,000km away from the UK - which explains why the weather is so fabulous in February.

Temperatures are regularly in the upper 20s, while the ocean water is prime for swimming at an inviting 28°C.

A once-in-a-lifetime destination, this South Pacific destination has more than 330 islands. Among the biggest and most popular are Viti Levu (where you'd find capital city Suva), Vanua Levu, Taveuni and Kadavu.

You're guaranteed to see some truly breathtaking beaches, practically plucked off a postcard and placed, unbelievably, right before your eyes.

But for the effort it'll take Brits to get there, you'll want to experience as much of Fiji as possible - by hopping across different islands, swimming in the pools of Tavoro Falls, walking through Sigatoka Sand Dunes National Park, seeing the Garden of the Sleeping Giant, and searching for Fiji's rarest birds.

The resort town of Punta Cana, in the east of the country, is a very popular place for winter sun escapes - as it is home to white-sand, turquoise-water beaches that go on for miles, peppered with palm trees.

Here, you can also try watersports from surfing to scuba diving, or hire a car and drive for 40 minutes to the historic city of Higuey to marvel at the Basilica Catedral Nuestra Senora de la Altagracia.

Drive further still (around two hours, 15 minutes) to reach the country's fascinating capital Santo Domingo, known for its seafront and Ciudad Colonial historic centre.

Elsewhere in the Dominican Republic, Puerto Plata is also a great place to base yourself for a trip - making sure to travel on the Teleferico Cable Car and to the city of Santiago de los Caballeros, where there is the powerful Monument to the Heroes of the Restoration.

Temperature: 28°C (up to 34°C)

Sunshine hours: Seven to eight hours (roughly)

Perfectly placed in the middle of dry season, with next to no rainfall expected, February is a fantastic time to fly to Costa Rica - where temperatures can climb into the low and mid-30°Cs.

From the UK, you'll typically fly into the Central American country's capital San José, and it's well worth spending a few days getting to know the city, before heading further afield.

It would be crazy to travel so far and not book a tour that incorporates some of Costa Rica's breathtaking natural sights: the Arenal Volcano, Monteverde Cloud Forest, or national parks Manuel Antonio or Corcovado.

Costa Rica is also beloved for its sensational array of wildlife, such as sloths, sea turtles, jaguars, scarlet macaws and squirrel monkeys.

If you're not sure where to start, consider booking a tour via Intrepid Travel, Trailfinders or a similar company to arrange your ideal itinerary and make travel arrangements.

Temperature: 24°C (up to 27°C)

Sunshine hours: Eight hours

Flight time: 11 hours

Another destination in the Caribbean, St Vincent and the Grenadines averages a pleasant mid 20s temperature during February.

For those looking to top up their tan there are plenty of options here, and no visit to the islands would be complete without a trip to Tobago Cays, the uninhabited archipelago which offer some of the best beaches for snorkelling and sunbathing in the Caribbean.

If you're staying in Mustique be sure to check out the super-exclusive Macaroni Beach, open only to guests and island residents, while Princess Margaret Beach and Salt Whistle Bay Beach are also must-visits.

When you're done sun-seeking, don't forget to stop by the Botanical Gardens -one of the oldest of its kind - and visit town Port Elizabeth's stunning scenery.

Temperature: 27°C (up to 31°C)

Sunshine hours: Nine hours

Sri Lanka typically has dry and pleasant weather in February, save the northern and eastern coasts.

Which part of the island to visit - or how much of the country you have time to visit - is a real conundrum.

You could start in the capital, Colombo, where many will fly into from the UK, and eventually make your way to Galle - a southwestern city known for its quiet charm, colonial Portuguese architecture, and its Dutch Sea Fort.

A popular tourist trail is the scenic seven-hour train journey through the lush Hill County from Ella, via Nuwara Eliya, to the city of Kandy, which is ideal if you like to travel by rail.

Temperature: 27°C (up to 30°C)

The hottest month is Brazilian city Rio de Janiero is February, reaching potential highs of 30°C - and water temperatures of around 25°C.

If you go to Brazil in February, the highlight of your trip will undoubtedly be Rio Carnival, which runs from February 9 to 14 in 2024 and from February 28 into March in 2025.

Unsurprisingly, the world-famous event attracts visitors from across the globe thanks to its colourful celebrations.

Away from the parades and the samba dancing, there's also plenty to explore in Rio itself - including the Sugarloaf Mountain and iconic Christ The Redeemer statue.

When you're done taking in the views, you can relax on one of its beaches - Ipanema and Copacabana being among the most famous.

Candy-coloured Spanish colonial architecture can be found in the Old Havana neighbourhood - but museums, incredible live music, brilliant bars and culture hubs make up the city.

If a city break isn't your thing, Varadero is probably one of the better-known white-sand beach towns. You won't struggle to find a place to sunbathe or read a book.

Or go beyond the initial tourist trail to discover the town of Trinidad, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, or make your way to Santa Clara to visit the mausoleum of revolutionary Che Guevara.

2024-02-01,My ex-boyfriend threw acid all over me. I thought I was going to die,"The moment I woke up from a three-month coma, I immediately felt angry.

Of course, I was fuming at the man who attacked me by dousing me in acid and severely burning off skin all over my body, but I was also mad at the doctors for keeping me alive.

I really thought my life was over and there was no point living anymore.

Thankfully, my outlook has changed since then and ever since my attack almost 13 years ago, I've been fighting for the rights of acid attack survivors.

It all started with a ring at my doorbell on 1 December 2009 when I was 45 years old.

I have an entry camera on my Belgian home so I answered the speaker and a voice bellowed: 'Madam, I have a package for you'.

I came down to have a closer look. As soon as I came out of the lift, I recognised him by his long keyring and his build through the window in the door - my ex, Richard.

When I got to the glass door, he opened it and - before I could say or do anything - he threw acid all over me.

The pain was immediately excruciating so I fell to the ground and screamed, while he shook me all over and kicked me. I looked at my right arm and the skin was melting right off, which was absolutely terrifying.

To get away, I called the lift in the building, but then I suddenly changed my mind because I thought I was going to die and I didn't want to die in the lift.

I wanted to go outside to find help, but my attacker was still there in the lobby. So he took the opportunity to grab me by my long hair, which he rolled around his wrist. He lifted my head and poured acid directly on my face.

The pain was excruciating. I didn't see Richard at all anymore and I have no idea what happened to him by this point. I really thought that my body had hit its pain threshold and my brain was saying stop.

I knew I had to get out of the building and call for help, then go into a nearby building where my old bosses worked. They are the ones who came to look in the street when they heard me screaming.

They called the ambulance but I honestly thought I was going to die before help arrived.

When I woke up three months later from my coma, my sister was there, as well as my three children. I knew I was safe but when I went to speak, nothing came out because I'd had a tracheotomy.

When I was all alone, I discovered a mirror. Staring back at me was my destroyed face and it was shocking.

I was treated for major burns at the military hospital, where I stayed for nine months. I had a lot of operations at the time - 80 in all. These included multiple skin grafts, the amputation of my ring finger and my left ear, and my left eye had to be removed. I also had operations on my leg because the acid had glued a nerve to my leg bone.

Then I went to another hospital for rehabilitation, to teach me to walk properly. To date, I've had 114 operations.

Throughout my recovery, I helped the police with their investigation and I believe they did an extraordinary job.

Richard was charged with attempted murder, and had a trial for his heinous crime. During the trial, my attacker never once looked at me.

He was eventually found guilty and sentenced to 30 years in prison, where he still is today. When the verdict was handed down, I was so relieved that my truth was recognised.

For me, it was important to make him understand what he'd done, and for him to see that I was still alive.

Richard attacked me after I ended the relationship we had for less than a year - even in that time, there was a lot of time apart.

I put a final end to the relationship when he told me that he was accused of murdering a 16-month-old baby in 1988. He actually went to trial a second time after his conviction because of me and was found guilty for the murder of the baby - getting a further 17 years in prison.

Today, I share my story to raise awareness about the issues facing acid attack survivors.

The Acid Survivors Trust International is doing an extraordinary job.

One of their reports aims to encourage companies to sign the pledge to work with them to take responsibility for how the acid they use is procured, stored, distributed and most importantly accounted for. The report identifies the good practices that businesses must follow.

The issue is stopping the cheap, easy access and availability of acid.

I think the solution is that people must purchase acid with an identity card. The seller should also notify the police of this type of purchase because it identifies the aggressor faster.

Since my attack, I have created a petition about regulating the sale of sulphuric acid in Belgium. Shops should put bottles of acid in a cabinet under lock and key, so thieves don't have access to it.

ASTi has been very supportive, and they actually joined me in Parliament in Belgium.

I want people to know that I recovered from my attack and that if this happens to you, your life isn't over.

I wrote my book Vitriolée! about my experience and I give lectures and speak in schools. When ASTi offers me opportunities to participate in events for acid attack survivors, I say yes immediately because I know that this raises more awareness and support for what they are doing, and will make people think.

I continue to hold conferences and participate in events for acid attack survivors. My future is to accept invitations to speak about my experience - I have been to France, Krakow, and was interviewed for Australian television.

Today, my activism and advocacy work keeps me busy.

On a personal level, I look forward to seeing my two grandchildren grow up. I'm so thankful to be alive.

ASTi launched a report at their Tear Couture event with the charity's Royal Patron, HRH Princess Anne, which encourages companies to sign their pledge to try to prevent acid attacks.

2024-02-01,"Napkin used to sign 13-year-old Lionel Messi to go up for auction - with a starting price of £300,000","A napkin used to ensure a 13-year-old Lionel Messi signed for Barcelona is to be sold at auction - with a starting price of £300,000.

The napkin was written on in blue ballpoint ink by Barcelona coach Carles Rexach and served as the club's commitment to sign the Argentinian prodigy.

It would become a pivotal moment in the history of the club, with Messi going on to win dozens of trophies with the Spanish side - becoming arguably the greatest player in the history of the game in the process.

The 16.5 x 16.5 cm napkin is now being put up for auction on behalf of Horacio Gaggioli, the agent who brought Messi to the attention of Mr Rexach, and who was at the table when it was signed.

It will be put under the hammer in an online auction by Bonhams in March, with a starting price of £300,000.

An ultimatum

Messi had come to the attention of Barcelona's scouts as a 12-year-old while playing for his local club, Newell's Old Boys, in Rosario, Argentina.

In September 2000, Messi and his father, Jorge, were flown to Barcelona for trials, but negotiations stalled.

While Mr Rexach was convinced of Messi's talent, board members at the club had their doubts.

Firstly, Messi was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency as a child and would require expensive treatment, which his family were unable to afford.

Club bosses were also concerned at the prospect of bringing a player from Argentina to Spain at such a young age.

A fateful napkin

By December, Jorge, frustrated at the lack of movement, eventually made an ultimatum to the club - sign my son or lose him.

So the story goes that Mr Rexach, without a piece of paper to hand, reached for the napkin and scribbled down a note, committing the club to sign 13-year-old Messi.

That night, the then president of FC Barcelona, Joan Gaspart, finally confirmed the agreement, this time on more substantial paper.

The rest, as they say, is history.

Messi would go on to become Barcelona's talisman, helping the Spanish side to 35 trophies throughout his career at the club.

2024-02-01,The signs point to interest rate cuts within months - here's why,"The conversation about rate cuts has now officially begun.

For months, even as the market began to bet that the Bank of England would soon begin reducing the cost of borrowing, those in Threadneedle Street were adamant that the time for such conversations had not yet come.

In the minutes alongside each of its decisions, the Bank dropped heavy hints that it was just as, if not more, likely that the next move in interest rates would be up rather than down.

Money latest - reaction to Bank of England decision

Now, everything has changed. Today we learnt that one of the nine members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted for a quarter point reduction in interest rates this month.

In the event, the member, Swati Dhingra, was outvoted by her fellow rate-setters, most of whom wanted to leave borrowing costs at 5.25%. Indeed, at the same meeting two members voted for higher rates.

Even so, this feels like one of those watershed moments - the beginning of a conversation which is increasingly likely to end in action, with Britain's official borrowing costs being cut, perhaps within a few months.

To see why it's helpful to consider the Kremlinology whereby the Bank drops hints about its future plans.

While in public the governor rarely, if ever, says baldly what they plan to do with interest rates in the coming months, there are a few ways in which he signals which way they're inclined to go.

One of them is the phraseology of the minutes, released alongside each decision.

In previous minutes, the Bank had included a telling phrase: ""Further tightening in monetary policy would be required if there were evidence of more persistent inflationary pressures."" The point had been that while many had come to assume that 5.25% would be the peak for interest rates, another rise was even more likely than a cut.

That phrase has been removed from the latest set of minutes, replaced with the more neutral phrase, that ""the committee will keep under review for how long Bank Rate should be maintained at its current level.""

Another signal comes via the so-called ""fan charts"" the Bank provides of where it expects inflation to go in the coming years. There are two versions of these charts: one which shows where inflation will go if interest rates are left on hold at their current level, and another version which shows where inflation will go if interest rates follow market expectations.

Here, too, there is a clear hint. The chart based on constant interest rates shows a very sharp fall in inflation to well below the Bank's 2% target. The accompanying chart showing the impact on gross domestic product - the best measure of economic growth - paints the picture of a deep recession.

On both of these bases, leaving rates on hold indefinitely would clearly be a mistake.

But of course, investors are betting that rates won't stay unchanged; they reckon the Bank will begin to cut them this summer, taking them down from 5.25% to just above 3% in the next few years.

Look at the second set of Bank inflation charts, which follow the thought experiment that the Bank indeed does what markets expect, and you see that far from dropping well below target, inflation hits 2% briefly this year (in part a statistical effect because of how volatile energy prices have been in the past year), rises again, but then eventually comes back to settle at around 2% by the end of 2026.

In short, it's pretty much bang on target.

Most investors will look at all of this evidence and come to the conclusion that the Bank is not pushing back on their expectations, for rates falling in the middle of the year and then continuing to fall in the coming years.",Money latest: the conversation about rate cuts has officially begun.

2024-02-01,"COVID Inquiry: 'Nicola Sturgeon could cry from one eye if she wanted to,' says Scottish Secretary Alister Jack","The UK COVID-19 Inquiry is currently sitting in Edinburgh as it probes the devolved administration's response to the pandemic. The former first minister fought back tears as she was quizzed about her actions on Wednesday.

Scottish Secretary Alister Jack has rejected Nicola Sturgeon's claim she did not seek to politicise the pandemic - claiming he ""didn't believe it for a minute"".

The former first minister repeatedly fought back tears as she appeared before the UK COVID-19 Inquiry on Wednesday, claiming she took accusations that she sought a different approach to the virus from the government in Westminster to advance the cause of Scottish independence ""very, very seriously"".

Ms Sturgeon said: ""People will make their own judgments about me, about my government, about my decisions, but for as long as I live, I will carry the impact of these decisions.

""I will carry regret at the decisions and judgments I got wrong, but I will always know in my heart and in my soul that my instincts and my motivation was nothing other than trying to do the best in the face of this pandemic.""

However, Mr Jack rubbished Ms Sturgeon's testimony as he appeared before the inquiry on Thursday as it sat for its final day in Edinburgh.

""I watched that evidence from yesterday and I didn't believe it for a minute,"" he said.

""I think Nicola Sturgeon could cry from one eye if she wanted to.""

The cabinet minister went on to say it was ""inevitable there would be tensions"" between the Scottish and UK governments given their different political positions on the union.

""The then first minister saw her job as leader of a nationalist government to break up the UK,"" he said.

""Devolution works very well but works very well when both governments want to work together. But when one government wants to destroy the UK and destroy devolution, then there are tensions.

""Those tensions existed before the pandemic, during the pandemic and they exist now today.""

Ms Sturgeon was questioned about her government's decision not to disclose an outbreak of COVID linked to a Nike conference in February 2020 to the public - a decision she said she would reverse in hindsight.

On Thursday, Mr Jack said the UK government was also not informed of the outbreak, despite both he and then UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock having spoken to then Scottish Health Secretary Jeane Freeman.

Mr Jack said: ""Another thing that had happened at that meeting, that had come to light in May, that despite being with the health secretary for two hours, at no point did she mention that they had discovered an outbreak at the Nike conference in Edinburgh.""

He said Mr Hancock only discovered the outbreak when newspapers had contacted him about the issue.

'Bit of a Luddite'

When asked about his WhatsApp messages, Mr Jack said: ""I deleted all of them.""

However, the cabinet member insisted no messages related to government business were removed - because he did not conduct such matters via the app in the first place.

He told the inquiry he deleted messages from his phone because the device was running out of memory.

2024-02-01,Glasgow care home worker Salieu Ruffai receives warning for dragging vulnerable woman along floor after fall,"A care home worker who caused a vulnerable woman to fall and then dragged her along the floor by her armpits has been given a formal warning by a watchdog.

Support worker Salieu Ruffai was found to have used incorrect procedures while attempting to move the resident from her chair without waking her.

Ruffai also failed to use a hoist after the woman fell and instead dragged her along the floor by her armpits from the bathroom back to her chair.

The Scottish Social Services Council (SSSC) further reprimanded the carer for failing to seek help and for not reporting the incident to bosses in an effort to conceal their wrongdoing.

The watchdog said: ""By causing [the woman] to fall and then dragging her along the floor by her underarms and failing to use a hoist to move her safely after she had fallen, you violated the rights of the service user to be cared for in a dignified manner and placed her at risk of serious physical and emotional harm.""

The SSSC said the behaviour of Ruffai, who was working at Orchard Grove House in Glasgow, fell below the ""acceptable standard of care expected of a social service worker"".

The watchdog added: ""Failing to seek assistance or to report that [the woman] had fallen placed her at further risk of harm and showed a disregard for her wellbeing.""

2024-02-01,CVC and Cinven make noise in £1.5bn sale of Audiotonix,"The private equity backer of Six Nations Rugby is drawing up plans for a £1.5bn bid for Audiotonix, the British-based manufacturer of equipment used by bands such as Coldplay.

Sky News has learnt that CVC Capital Partners is among the private equity firms examining offers for the Chessington-based company.

On Thursday, City sources said that Cinven, another sizeable buyout firm, is also preparing to lodge a bid as part of a formal sale process.

Audiotonix, which makes professional audio consoles, is expected to be valued at between £1.5bn and £2bn, according to bankers.

Ardian, the French buyout firm which owns a stake in Audiotonix, is in the process of initiating a sale process by hiring bankers to advise on it, Sky News reported last month.

Audiotonix's equipment has been used by bands including Coldplay and U2 during their global tours.

It is estimated to have a 30% market share across roughly 90 countries, with brands including DiGiCo, Allen & Heath and Solid State Logic.

Calrec, another Audiotonix brand, mixed sound that was broadcast to a broadcast audience of millions from the late Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee concert in 2022.

Acquired by Ardian in 2019, from Astorg, another private equity firm, Audiotonix was founded in 2014.

2024-02-01,Rachel Reeves defends decision not to restore bankers' bonus cap,"Rachel Reeves has defended her decision not to restore a cap on bankers' bonuses, arguing businesses do not need ""more chopping and changing"".

The shadow chancellor said that when the government scrapped the cap under Liz Truss, Labour did not ""feel that was the right priority in that budget"".

But she said much stronger rules were now in place since the 2008 financial crash, when the cap was first introduced, and that it was no longer her priority to restore it.

""What I hear loud and clear from business is that what it will take to get them to invest in Britain is stability and the last thing they need is more chopping and changing,"" she said.

""The chopping and changing has got to end if we're going to give stability to business and that's why we will not be bringing that back.""

Politics latest:

Labour 'under no illusions about scale of task ahead'

Addressing Labour's business conference in central London this morning, Ms Reeves also announced she would not increase the headline rate of corporation tax of 25% during the first term of a Labour government but left the door open to changes in the rate in the future.

She said: ""There have been 26 changes to our corporation tax arrangements in this parliament alone. We can't go on like this.

""The next Labour government will make the pro-business choice and the pro-growth choice: We will cap the headline rate of corporation tax at its current rate of 25% for the next parliament.

""And should our competitiveness come under threat, if necessary we will act.""

Ms Reeves also said Labour would maintain full expensing and the annual investment allowance and would provide a ""road map"" for business taxation within the first six months of government.

Ms Reeves has sought to portray herself as pro-business during her time as shadow chancellor, in contrast to her predecessor John McDonnell, who led Labour's economic policy when Jeremy Corbyn was the leader of the Opposition.

Will Labour stick to £28bn a year green pledge?

However, the shadow chancellor is facing scrutiny over Labour's pledge to spend £28bn a year on green projects until 2030 if the party comes into power.

In a Q&A following her speech, Ms Reeves failed to commit to the policy, which some in Labour want Sir Keir Starmer to drop because it allows the Conservatives to cast doubt on the party's commitment to fiscal discipline.

Asked by Sky News's political editor Beth Rigby whether the pledge had become ""an albatross around your neck"" that ""threatens to unravel all the hard work you've done to be trusted with economic competence"", Ms Reeves said there were ""big opportunities to invest alongside business in the jobs and the industries of the future"".

But she said it was ""absolutely essential that all of our policies are consistent with our fiscal rules"" and that the green prosperity plan ""was no exception to that"".

The shadow chancellor said that after the next budget, the party will ""set out our plans and ensure they are consistent with our fiscal rules because they will always take precedence to guarantee the economic security of family finances and of businesses as well"".

Tories attack Labour over bonus cap change

The cap on bankers' bonuses was first introduced in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to limit annual payouts to twice a banker's salary, but it was scrapped by former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng during Ms Truss's short time as prime minister.

During Prime Minister's Questions this week, Rishi Sunak seized on the issue to argue that voters ""cannot trust a word he [Sir Keir Starmer] says"".

""I was genuinely surprised that, after recently and repeatedly attacking not just me but the government for lifting the bonus cap, the shadow chancellor has announced, just today, that she now supports the government's policy on the bankers' bonus cap.""

Ms Reeves and other senior Labour figures had been vocal critics of the government's decision to axe the cap during a cost of living crisis, saying only three months ago that the decision to allow unlimited bonuses to be earned again ""tells you everything you need to know about this government"".

The issue has caused some division within Labour, with Anas Sarwar, the party's leader in Scotland, previously criticising Ms Truss as a ""Thatcher tribute act"" who would rather ""boost bankers' bonuses than help those in need"".

He told reporters in Westminster today that he stood by his previous words but added: ""You have got to look at it in the balance. We have got to inspire confidence for them to make the strategic investments, but we can't return to a situation where they get away with it.

""I'm not here to defend bankers' bonuses, I'm not here to defend banks. That is something the UK Treasury has got to keep an eye on.""

Stephen Flynn, the SNP's leader in Westminster and Labour's main opponent in Scotland, sarcastically praised Mr Sunak for convincing the Labour Party to agree to a ""bleak future"", saying it was a ""great achievement"" for the government.","Rachel Reeves has defended her decision not to restore a cap on bankers' bonuses.

2024-02-01,Firecrackers explode and thick smoke fills the air as seething farmers arrive at Brussels' door,"Ahead of us, a ring of police protecting the European Parliament while acrid smoke billows over our heads. Firecrackers go off all the time, near and far.

The very heart of Brussels, normally populated by politicians, advisers and smooth-suited lobbyists, has been transformed into a cauldron.

A firecracker explodes too near for comfort. On the other side of Place Luxembourg, a hay bale is on fire. Next to it, a green flare has gone off. Then someone throws a rubber tyre on to the smouldering fire and thick black smoke starts filling the air.

To be in the middle of Brussels right now is a visceral experience of noise, smell, heat and sights.

And lacing it all, a sense of tension between those who have come to protest, and those who stand in their way.

For weeks, farmers have been demonstrating in their countries - blocking roads in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy and beyond.

The French farmers are today heading towards their own Parliament.

The Belgian farmers have only recently revved up their own tractors to join the protest, but the momentum is growing and now their own capital has become the focus of so much attention.

Read more on this story: Fires erupt during protests

There are reckoned to be a thousand tractors in the city today. I don't remember ever seeing one in the city's central European quarter before.

But none of this is a coincidence. The European Parliament is blamed for endorsing restrictive environmental legislation that has hindered farmers, slashed profits and increased bureaucracy.

And, increasingly, the focus of these protests is also being directed at the European institutions who have designed and signed free trade agreements with the rest of the world.

These have pushed down the cost of many items - grain, meat, vegetables, fruit, which may be good for consumers, but is palpably bad for farmers.

Anger is simmering among Europe's farmers

Ukraine's top general 'refuses request to step down'

Another regular complaint is that some countries stick to the rules, forcing their farmers to abide with new regulations, while others turn a blind eye.

""Why should we have to suffer when farmers in Romania don't have to do anything because nothing will happen to them if they break the rules,"" said one French farmer.

And amid all of this acrid acrimony, Europe's leaders are arriving in town.

At the European Council building, just a short stroll from the Parliament, the EU's presidents and prime ministers are gathering to discuss a variety of topics, including their budget and their ongoing support for Ukraine - fitting, because the benevolent decision to allow Ukrainian agricultural exports to enter Europe is another recurring gripe among farmers.

What isn't on the agenda of these EU leaders is the question of how to handle their angry farmers. But in the margins, surely, it will come up.

2024-02-01,PwC kicks off hunt for successor to Ellis as UK chief,"PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) is kicking off the hunt for its first new UK chief in nearly a decade amid growing expectations that it could appoint a female boss for the first time in its 175-year history.

Sky News has learnt that the world's biggest accountancy firm has initiated the process through which its supervisory board - consisting of PwC partners - will oversee the installation of a successor to Kevin Ellis.

The firing of the starting-gun on the process to fill arguably the most prestigious job in British professional services has ignited internal speculation about the identity of Mr Ellis's replacement.

While a shortlist will not be identified until April, when the election of a new UK chair will also take place, insiders have pointed towards several female partners as credible contenders.

Among them is Marissa Thomas, the firm's managing partner and chief operating officer, and a member of its management board since 2017.

Laura Hinton, the partner who leads PwC UK's tax function and also sits on the management board, is also seen as a potential candidate.

Others identified as possible successors to Mr Ellis include Hemione Hudson, the head of audit, and Marco Amitrano, the firm's head of clients and markets.

Mr Ellis has served as UK chair for two terms, steering PwC through a tumultuous period including the Brexit vote and its aftermath, and the COVID pandemic.

Although it remains extremely profitable, with partners enjoying average seven-figure annual pay packages, PwC has not been immune to broader pressures on the industry, and last November announced hundreds of job cuts in response to market headwinds.

Like its 'big four' peers Deloitte, EY and KPMG, it has also been grappling with growing political and regulatory pressure on the future structure of the audit profession following a wave of high-profile corporate collapses.

PwC has been fined for a string of audit failings, most notably in relation to Arcadia, the former high street clothing empire of Sir Philip Green.

2024-02-01,Barbie star Margot Robbie reacts to Oscars snub for best actress and Greta Gerwig for best director,"Barbie star Margot Robbie says ""there's no way to feel sad"" despite missing out on an Oscars nomination for best actress.

Margot Robbie has broken her silence over being snubbed for an Oscar nomination in the best actress category.

The Barbie star said ""there's no way to feel sad when you know you're this blessed"" despite failing to receive a nod.

But she defended director Greta Gerwig, who missed out on a nomination in the best director category.

""Obviously, I think Greta should be nominated as a director,"" she said, during a Sag-Aftra panel discussion.

""What she did is a once-in-a-career, once-in-a-lifetime thing, what she pulled off, it really is. But it's been an incredible year for all the films.

""We set out to do something that would shift culture, affect culture, just make some sort of impact, and it's already done that and some, way more than we ever dreamed it would.

""That is truly the biggest reward that could come out of all of this.""

Robbie said she was ""beyond ecstatic"" the box office blockbuster landed eight Oscar nominations, including best supporting actress for America Ferrera, who plays Gloria, and best supporting actor for Ryan Gosling, who plays Ken.

Gerwig missed out as best director, but was named alongside her husband Noah Baumbach for best adapted screenplay, while Robbie lost out on a best actress nomination but was recognised for best picture as a producer.

Gosling said he was ""honoured"" by the nomination but ""disappointed"" Robbie and Gerwig were snubbed in their individual categories.

""But there is no Ken without Barbie, and there is no Barbie movie without Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie, the two people most responsible for this history-making, globally-celebrated film.

""No recognition would be possible for anyone on the film without their talent, grit and genius.""

Hillary Clinton also offered her support to the stars who missed out.

2024-02-01,Shell reports fall in profits to £22bn after record 2022,"Profits at oil and gas giant Shell have dipped below the record highs of 2022 but totalled $28.25bn (£22.32bn) in 2023 as energy prices remained high.

The company traded more in liquified natural gas (LNG) and increased production. This offset the fact it earned less from refining and from oil trading, and faced higher operating costs.

Profits in 2022 reached a record high of $39.9bn (£32.2bn) following the oil and gas price spikes after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

While it's a fall of more than $10bn from a year ago, the firm's 2023 profits still surpass those recorded in recent years and are nearly double the $16.5bn (£12.7bn) booked in the pre-pandemic year of 2019.

Profit last year was also close to the company's previous record amount of $31bn reported in 2008.

Energy costs were still higher than before the war in Ukraine with the cost of a benchmark Brent crude barrel of oil reaching $90 numerous times throughout 2023.

Despite falling profits, shareholders are in line for a 4% increase in dividends and the company announced it is to buy back $3.5bn (£2.7bn) worth of shares.

Another share buyback, also worth $3.5bn, has already taken place, as announced in the previous quarterly market update.

The biggest contributor to profits was the gas portion of the business, Shell's annual figures showed.

The company's oil division also performed well because of higher production than the previous quarter.

2024-02-01,Train strikes 2024: Full list of dates as rail and London Overground workers strike in February and March,"Both unions are locked in a dispute over pay. Here's a full list of the dates and lines affected by strikes in February and March.

Train and rail strikes will impact commuters in February and March, as both ASLEF and RMT union members walk out over pay.

The strikes by ASLEF will affect the services of 17 train companies.

Fresh industrial action and an overtime ban by drivers is likely to cause widespread disruption in an ongoing dispute over pay, the union said.

In some places, there may be no services at all on strike days, and services that are running will start later and finish much earlier than usual - typically running between 7.30am and 6.30pm.

Here is a full list of the services affected by strikes and overtime bans, and when.

National Rail urges anyone hoping to travel on strike and overtime ban days to use its Journey Planner to keep an eye on how services will be affected.

London Overground

More than 300 union members will stage two 48-hour strikes after receiving a lower-than-inflation pay offer, the RMT said.

Security, station, revenue and control staff are among those taking industrial action.

The action will take place on the following dates

General Secretary Mick Whelan said: ""We have given the government every opportunity to come to the table but it is now a year since we had any contact from the Department for Transport. It's clear they do not want to resolve this dispute.

""Many members have now not had a single penny increase in pay for half a decade, during which time inflation has soared and, with it, the cost of living. We didn't ask for an increase during the pandemic, when we worked through lockdown, as key workers, risking our lives, to move goods around the country and enable NHS and other workers to get to work.""

He urged the government to ""come to the table"" to end the dispute.

RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said: ""London Overground workers do an important job delivering services for TfL and supporting passengers on journeys throughout London.

""Our members are furious that they have been given a below inflation pay offer and want to see an improvement that represents the value they bring to the company.

""If this dispute cannot be resolved then RMT is more than prepared for a sustained period of industrial action to get London Overground workers the pay rise they deserve.""","Train and rail strikes will impact commuters in February and March.

2024-02-01,Polestar 4: First car without a rear window to make its way on to British roads,"The Swedish-made Polestar 4 will be fitted with a high-definition screen that shows a real-time feed from a roof-mounted rear camera instead of a rear-view mirror.

The first car without a rear window is set to make its way on to British roads.

The Swedish-made Polestar 4 will be fitted with a high-definition screen that shows a real-time feed from a roof-mounted rear camera instead of a rear-view mirror.

The car manufacturer, which is owned by Volvo, has taken the back window out completely to give more headroom and replaced it with a camera.

It said it would give motorists a ""unique experience"" and a better view of the road behind them.

Motoring journalist Quentin Willson told Sky News: ""Rear windows on cars have been getting smaller and smaller, and as more consumers want more voluptuous shapes... you have a problem, because the window gets smaller and smaller and you have to have more headroom.

""So Volvo have done a really clever thing and got rid of the rear window completely and given us this new rear window on the world.

""The car has been out in China since December and there have been no discouraging words.

""The argument is, I think, it actually gives you a better view because the camera is high definition, it's a wider arc, and you see more than you would than through that grimy rear window.""

It isn't without premise. Many vans don't have rear-view windows, and many trucks are now using cameras instead of wing mirrors.

""We see so many cars on the roads with obscured windows because the car's full of stuff and you get one passenger in the middle, it's hard to see out,"" said Willson.

""So it's not something we should howl in terror that we've lost.

""It's just the stylistic evolutionary process of the motor car.""

He added: ""It's bold, it's challenging - that's what we need in car design.

""We've been through a stage where everything was homogeneous and boring, and this is actually very revolutionary, so let's welcome it rather than decry it.""

2024-02-01,More US strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen but White House stays quiet on plan for retaliation over Jordan deaths,"Two days on from Joe Biden telling reporters he knows what the US response to a deadly drone strike on American troops will be, any plan for retaliation remains unclear. But strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen have continued in the meantime.

The US struck up to 10 drones preparing to launch from Houthi sites in Yemen overnight but the White House is still keeping its plans for a response to a deadly raid on an American military base behind closed doors.

On Tuesday, President Joe Biden said he has decided how the US will respond to the drone attack on a military base in Jordan, which killed three US service personnel.

President Biden's administration says it believes militants backed by Iran were behind the drone strike.

No further information on the US response has been revealed since then.

However, the American military has continued its airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen after the group repeatedly targeted commercial vessels in the region.

Latest as US strikes multiple Houthi targets in Yemen

The latest strikes were carried out at 1.30am local time on Thursday morning, when a US Navy ship also shot down three Iranian drones and a Houthi anti-ship missile, US Central Command said.

""This action will protect freedom of navigation and make international waters safer and more secure for US Navy vessels and merchant vessels,"" the command centre said in a statement.

Pressure has grown on Mr Biden to respond, with the US believing an Iran-backed group was responsible for the attack.

While the White House still hasn't revealed further information, Sky News's US partner network NBC News reported on Wednesday the response could form a ""campaign"" that could last for weeks.

Among the expected targets are Iranian sites outside of Iran, with other locations across several countries also in US attack plans.

The campaign could include strikes and cyber operations.

2024-02-01,Footage emerges of Clapham chemical attack which injured mother and two children,"Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player

Footage has emerged of the chemical attack in south London in which a woman and two children were injured.

Police say a ""corrosive substance"" was thrown during the attack in Clapham, which was described by the fire brigade as a ""chemical incident"".

The CCTV footage shows a man running around a car before getting into the driver's seat, with a woman and child in front of the vehicle holding their hands to their faces.

The man drives the car at the woman and strikes her, before he stops the vehicle and gets out. He opens the back door and appears to remove a child, before violently throwing them to the ground.

The video also appears to show people from neighbouring properties leaving their homes to chase the man down the road.

Nine people were injured in the incident, including two children, their mother and three police officers.

It took place on Lessar Avenue shortly before 7.30pm on Wednesday.

Five of those injured were taken to a major trauma centre, according to the London Ambulance Service (LAS).

Three more were taken to a local hospital and one was discharged at the scene.

Detective Superintendent Alexander Castle, of the Metropolitan Police, said the substance was believed to be ""corrosive"" but that tests were ongoing.

A helicopter is now involved in a manhunt to catch the person behind the attack.

'It was all so traumatising'

An eyewitness, who asked to stay anonymous, told Sky News: ""There was a man in a white car with two children. It looked like he tried to run over a woman. They had been fighting.

""One girl in the back had her hand on the window - you can see the mark on the car.

""He grabbed one of the two children and violently grabbed them and slammed them on the floor.

""The lady then shouted: 'My eyes! My eyes! Call the police, my eyes!'

""Then I saw him run off. It was all so traumatising.""

2024-02-01,COVID inquiry: Five key moments from Nicola Sturgeon's testimony,"Former Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon found herself in the hot seat as she gave evidence at the UK COVID-19 inquiry.

Here are five key moments from the day as the inquiry - currently sitting in Edinburgh - probes the devolved administration's response to the pandemic.

'Part of me wishes I wasn't first minister when COVID hit'

Ms Sturgeon fought back tears as she told the inquiry that a ""large part"" of her wishes she had not been Scotland's first minister when the pandemic first struck.

The inquiry heard last week how Ms Sturgeon branded Boris Johnson a ""f****** clown"" in a foul-mouthed message to her chief of staff as the then prime minister appeared on TV to announce the second national lockdown.

Giving evidence on Wednesday, Ms Sturgeon told Jamie Dawson KC, counsel to the inquiry, that she thought Mr Johnson was the ""wrong person"" to be prime minister.

In response to whether she thought of herself to be ""precisely the right first minister for the job"", Ms Sturgeon replied tearfully: ""No, that's not how I would have thought of it at all.

""I was the first minister when the pandemic struck. There's a large part of me wishes that I hadn't been.

""But I was, and I wanted to be the best first minister I could be during that period. It is for others to judge the extent to which I succeeded.""

Lawyer Aamer Anwar, who is representing the Scottish COVID Bereaved group, said Ms Sturgeon had delivered a ""polished performance"" during her testimony, but his clients were ""deeply unsatisfied"" with the explanations around the deletion of WhatsApp messages.

Group member Pamela Thomas, whose brother died during the pandemic, said: ""Crocodile tears aren't washing with me.""

In full: Nicola Sturgeon at the COVID inquiry

'I deleted messages but pandemic decisions were not made via WhatsApp'

The deletion of messages exchanged by ministers and officials during the pandemic has come under close scrutiny.

The inquiry has already heard how Ms Sturgeon and her deputy, John Swinney, failed to retain their informal messages - although correspondence saved by recipients has been submitted.

Professor Sir Gregor Smith, Scotland's chief medical officer, told colleagues to delete WhatsApp messages ""at the end of every day"", while national clinical director Professor Jason Leitch described the daily deletion of messages as a ""pre-bed ritual"".

Ms Sturgeon said she did not use informal messaging to make decision during the pandemic.

She initially told the inquiry her messages ""weren't retained"" - rather than deleted - in line with government policy.

Mr Dawson asked: ""But did you delete them?""

Ms Sturgeon replied: ""Yes, in the manner I have set out.""

The Glasgow Southside MSP also apologised for telling a journalist in August 2021 that she would hand over all of her messages despite knowing many of her WhatsApps had already been deleted.

Ms Sturgeon apologised to Mr Dawson if the answer to Channel 4's Ciaran Jenkins during a media briefing was ""not as clear"" as it should have been.

She gave a ""personal assurance"" that the inquiry has ""anything and everything germane to my decision-making during the process and the time period of the pandemic and the factors underpinning those decisions"".

'My chief regret is that we didn't lock down earlier'

Ms Sturgeon denied she ""jumped the gun"" on a decision to ban mass gatherings in March 2020.

Instead, she said one of her chief regrets was not announcing it earlier.

She said: ""Of the many regrets I have, probably chief of those is that we didn't lock down a week, two weeks, earlier than we did.""

Earlier this week, Michael Gove told the inquiry that Ms Sturgeon broke confidentiality and ""jumped the gun"" when she announced a ban on mass gatherings in Scotland.

Ms Sturgeon refuted the criticism, stating: ""None of us were jumping the gun - we were arguably all going more slowly than we should have been.""

She announced the ban on 12 March 2020 despite a COBRA meeting called later that day to discuss the pandemic.

Ms Sturgeon said: ""We would obviously listen to other views at COBRA but this was a Scottish government decision to take.

""I was increasingly concerned that we were not moving fast enough to deal with the rate of transmission of COVID.""

'I wish I could turn the clock back to reduce care home deaths'

Ms Sturgeon admitted there were ""flaws and deficiencies"" in care home guidance in the early part of the pandemic.

According to evidence heard earlier in the inquiry, 82% of the 3,595 patients discharged between 1 March and 21 April 2020 were not tested for the virus.

A Public Health Scotland report in 2020 also found more than 100 people who had previously tested positive for the virus were admitted from hospital to a care home before returning a negative test.

Ms Sturgeon said: ""I do not think we got everything right around care homes and I deeply regret that.

""There were undoubtedly flaws and deficiencies in that guidance, but the advice at the time was isolation - keeping people as separate as possible - was the best way to protect people in care homes, and clearly that didn't have the effect that we wanted it to have.""

Under questioning from Kevin McCaffrey, representing the Scottish COVID Bereaved group, Ms Sturgeon was asked what she would have done differently in her approach to care homes.

She replied: ""I would do everything in my power, and I wish I could turn the clock back and do different things that would have reduced the loss of life in care homes.""

'I did not politicise a global pandemic'

Ms Sturgeon denied making decisions for political reasons, claiming she had not ""thought less"" about politics and Scottish independence in her life than she did during the pandemic.

The inquiry was earlier shown a cabinet document from July 2020 where Brexit and Scottish independence were referenced.

In the cabinet meeting it was agreed that consideration should be given to ""restarting work on independence"".

Ms Sturgeon said ""work did not restart"", adding: ""There was no prospect of starting work on independence at that time, but in any event it didn't happen.""

She claimed her government ""focused entirely"" on getting the country through COVID.

An email was also shown in which concern was raised that the Spanish government would block an independent Scotland from joining the EU if travel restrictions during the pandemic remained.

Mr Dawson asked Ms Sturgeon if using the pandemic to push for independence would be a ""considerable betrayal of the Scottish people"".

She replied: ""If I had at any point decided to politicise a global pandemic that was robbing people of their lives and livelihoods, and educational opportunities, and had decided in the face of that to prioritise campaigning for independence, then, yes, it absolutely would have been as you described.

""Which is precisely why I didn't do it - I wouldn't have done it.""

Ms Sturgeon refuted a claim that she wanted to be the person that drove COVID out, admitting that she took it ""very, very personally"" when her motives during the pandemic are questioned.

She later said: ""People will make their own judgments about me, about my government, about my decisions, but for as long as I live, I will carry the impact of these decisions.

""I will carry regret at the decisions and judgments I got wrong, but I will always know in my heart and in my soul that my instincts and my motivation was nothing other than trying to do the best in the face of this pandemic.""","Nicola Sturgeon fought back tears as she gave evidence at the COVID inquiry.

2024-02-01,Three dead and five in critical condition after hangar collapses at Boise Airport in Idaho,"The privately owned hangar was under construction as part of a $6.2m (£4.9m) project by a business which offers private aeroplane charters and maintenance. The cause of the incident is being investigated, officials said.

An airport hangar under construction on an airfield in Idaho has collapsed killing three people.

Nine others were injured in the incident which happened at around 5pm on Wednesday on the grounds of Boise Airport, officials said.

Five of the injured are in a critical condition and receiving care at local hospitals.

Boise Fire Department, Boise Police, Gowen Field Fire Department, and Ada County Paramedics responded to the incident.

""Tonight, there was a catastrophic collapse of a metal structure at a construction site,"" said Aaron Hummel, Boise Fire Department operations chief.

""First responders found a hectic scene and worked to secure and rescue victims.

""The Boise Airport, city of Boise, and all first responders extend their deepest sympathies to those impacted.""

Everyone at the site has been accounted for, he said, and the cause of the ""large-scale collapse"" is being investigated.

""I don't know what caused it, but I can tell you it was a pretty global collapse,"" he said.

Some of the victims were on a hoist or elevated platform at the time the structure fell, and that required some specialised rescue efforts, he said.

He confirmed that a crane also collapsed during the incident.

Boise Airport operations were unaffected, and no city-owned buildings were impacted by the incident.

The names of those who died will be released by Ada County Coroner's Office pending notification of next of kin, officials said.

Firefighters remain at the scene, the site is secure and there is no threat to the public, officials said.

Terra Furman was driving on Interstate 84 at about 5.30pm when she spotted at least 20 police cars, ambulances and fire engines near the entry to the airport.

They were around what she described as a crane folded in half and a building collapsed into the shape of an ""M"".

""The walls were still up at a point and the middle collapsed in on either side,"" she said.

James Quintana was driving to the airport when he saw emergency vehicles rushing past him.

He said he immediately thought it was a plane crash. He then saw the collapsed hangar and paramedics tending to victims.

""I'm retired law enforcement and when there is that much commotion, that many emergency personnel and vehicles, there is something huge that has taken place. It was a scary sight,"" he said.

2024-02-01,Interest rates latest: Bank of England announcing latest base rate decision at 12pm today - and there are five things to look out for,"Five-minute read: How bad will finances be for next government?

In spite of all the largesse about potential tax cuts in the spring budget, the public finances remain in a parlous state, reflecting the scars of both the pandemic and, further back, the global financial crisis.

The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) expects government borrowing for the 2023-24 financial year to come in at £123.9bn, falling to £84.6bn in 2024-25 - the fiscal year in which a new government is expected to take the helm. Even if the figures come in better than expected, as they have this financial year, it is still an unenviable inheritance for any incoming government.

The Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) observed last week: ""The next government is likely to face some of the most difficult economic and fiscal choices the UK has faced outside of pandemics, conflicts and financial crises.""

It points out that taxes are at record levels for the UK while a combination of high interest payments on the national debt and low growth will make it harder than at any point since the 1950s to reduce debt as a share of national income.

With spending on the NHS and education ring-fenced, the implication is that there will be real-term spending cuts elsewhere, which threatens to make life hard for whoever is chancellor come spring next year - not least amid growing evidence that the UK needs to raise defence spending in the face of geopolitical tensions.

That said, the fiscal position is improving, as OBR forecasts make clear. That largely reflects the fact that the government has sought to be disciplined on public spending while increasing taxes dramatically.

Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has it in his power to make life harder for his putative successor Rachel Reeves. Spending more or taxing less now would reduce her ability to deliver on big-ticket Labour pledges and most notably its pledge to invest £28bn annually on low-carbon infrastructure projects. Ms Reeves herself has said that Labour will put a greater priority on its fiscal promises.

The language used by the IFS, though, is striking particularly given some of the dire situations with public finances that previous governments have inherited.

Economies inherited by new governments

The coalition government, for example, received a dreadful fiscal inheritance from Gordon Brown's outgoing Labour government. In 2009-10, the last financial year before the coalition came to power, the budget deficit stood at 10.1% of UK GDP - a consequence of government tax receipts (particularly from the financial services sector) collapsing during the global financial crisis.

The then-Chancellor George Osborne's response was to implement an austerity programme that was maintained by his predecessors. It brought the deficit down to just 2% of GDP by 2018-19, before the pandemic turned public finances upside down.

But the consequences of that fiscal discipline have been felt in a number of areas - like the courts system - which unlike the NHS did not benefit from their budget being ring-fenced.

Mr Brown himself had benefited from a decent fiscal inheritance when, in 1997, he entered the Treasury after Tony Blair's electoral landslide.

From the moment the UK was bundled out of the old European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) on ""Black Wednesday"", 16 September 1992, the UK economy enjoyed a period of unbroken economic growth that brought down the deficit sharply to just 4% of GDP.

The national debt, which now stands at 98% of GDP, was just 45% of GDP when Ken Clarke handed over the reins to Mr Brown. Not that the latter was especially appreciative. An STV camera crew, documenting Mr Brown's first days in the Treasury, caught him snapping at Treasury mandarins who dared to point out to the new chancellor the favourable situation he had inherited from his predecessor: ""What do you want me to do - write a thank-you letter?""

Mr Brown stuck to Ken Clarke's tight spending plans - Mr Clarke himself later chuckled that he would not have done so had John Major won in 1997 - to such a degree that, by the 2000-01 financial year, the UK government was actually running a surplus. It has not done so since.

Further back, when Margaret Thatcher's first Chancellor, Sir Geoffrey Howe, entered the Treasury in 1979, addressing the budget deficit was one of many challenges.

Bringing down inflation and addressing the UK's chronic lack of competitiveness at the time were at least as great priorities. Moreover, by the time Sir Geoffrey entered the Treasury, the deficit was falling.

The turning point had come in 1976 when, after the national humiliation of the UK receiving an IMF bail-out, Prime Minister James Callaghan told that year's Labour Party conference: ""We used to think you could spend your way out of recession and increase employment by boosting government spending.

""I tell you, in all candour, that that option no longer exists. And in so far as it ever did exist, it only worked on each occasion... by injecting a bigger dose of inflation into the economy, followed by a higher level of unemployment as the next step.""

His speech remains one of the great post-war political moments in the UK - the moment the government faced up to the need to tackle inflation.

It meant tough decisions - and it is fair to say that Denis Healey, Mr Callaghan's chancellor, did not as a result indulge in pre-election giveaways in 1979. There was no scope to do so.

Pre-election giveaways

In fact, pre-election giveaways are a relatively recent phenomenon. Labour's Roy Jenkins, the first chancellor since the war to actually begin repaying the national debt (something only achieved subsequently by Gordon Brown and Nigel Lawson), could have indulged in them in 1970 but chose not to on the assumption that the public had already got the message that the economy was recovering.

He was wrong. A rogue set of trade figures and England's shock elimination from the 1970 World Cup at the hands of West Germany, days before the country went to the polls, unexpectedly saw Edward Heath return to power.

The inheritance he left in 1974 was a poor one. Anthony Barber, chancellor for most of the Heath government, had embarked on a so-called ""dash for growth"" that merely led to a wage-price spiral and surging inflation. The two 1974 elections, with the benefit of hindsight, were good ones for the Conservatives to lose.

Among the worst inheritances an incoming chancellor has received was the one Mr Callaghan himself got when Labour was elected under Harold Wilson in 1964. His Conservative predecessor, Reggie Maudling, had embarked on a period of expansion that had landed the UK with a large current account deficit (when imports exceed exports) that was putting pressure on the pound.

Mr Maudling told Mr Callaghan, as he left the Treasury: ""Sorry, old cock, to leave it in this shape."" Mr Callaghan thought he had been referring to the state of the chancellor's office rather than the economy. The Wilson government was eventually obliged, in 1967, to devalue the pound.

It was, incidentally, the Maudling quip to Mr Callaghan that partly inspired the outgoing chief secretary to the Treasury, Liam Byrne, to leave a note to his successor in 2010 with the words: ""I'm afraid there is no money"".

So, while it may look as if the next government will face a tough fiscal inheritance, so have plenty of its predecessors.",The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) expects government borrowing for 2023-24 to come in at £123.9bn.

2024-02-01,Post Office scandal: Alan Bates to refuse 'offensive' compensation offer,"The former sub-postmaster described the government's proposal as ""derisory"" and ""cruel"".

Alan Bates, who led the campaign for justice in the Post Office Horizon scandal, says he will reject the compensation he has been offered by the government.

The former sub-postmaster, whose 20 year fight inspired the ITV series Mr Bates vs The Post Office, told The Daily Telegraph the offer was ""offensive"" and ""cruel"".

The government confirmed plans for ""full and fair compensation"" to sub-postmasters affected by the scandal in 2022.

But Mr Bates said the compensation offer had been ""around a sixth"" of what he requested and told the newspaper: ""'Full and fair' might be His Majesty's government's interpretation, but in reality the offer is derisory, offensive and after all this time, yes, cruel.

""I will absolutely be turning this offer for financial redress down.

""It's just a terrible way to treat human beings - and I have heard from several sub-postmasters who have received similarly derisory offers, while others are still waiting.""

""I have been in the queue along with all the others in the scheme, but if my case is an example of the way they are going to treat all cases, we may as well start looking at a legal action again and let the judiciary decide.""

Mr Bates was among more than 500 people who received an average of about £20,000 after a High Court ruling in 2019.

2024-02-01,"'Almost inevitable' UK will burn more gas and import more energy after Hinkley nuclear plant delayed, experts warn","The fresh delays to Hinkley Point C nuclear power station will ""very likely"" force the UK to burn more gas and import more energy than expected, analysts have told Sky News.

The already delayed project had been due to provide 7% of the UK's electricity from 2027, until it was pushed back again last week by another 2-4 years.

The likely uptick in dirtier gas power would also add more greenhouse gases just as the UK is trying to slash them by 2030, the industry voices warned.

The UK government did not deny that gas and energy imports will likely increase, but insisted climate targets would not suffer as a result.

An energy department spokesperson said: ""Hinkley Point C will serve Britain until well into the next century, making an important contribution to the UK's net zero commitments.""

Professor Rob Gross, director of UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC), said the delays to Hinkley made increasing gas burn in the meantime ""almost inevitable"".

Wind or solar are unlikely to plug the gap because the UK is already ""struggling to connect all the renewables schemes already in the pipeline for 2027/28"", he said.

Glenn Rickson, who analyses the UK power sector for S&P Global Commodity Insights, also said it is ""almost inevitable"" that UK gas generation ""will be higher"" than if Hinkley had fired up in 2027.

He added: ""Albeit well below current levels, mostly due to increased wind generation in the meantime.""

Increased energy imports and emissions likely in short term

But the ""the single biggest change may be an increased pull on power imports from the UK's neighbours"", said Mr Rickson.

Prof Gross also said the UK ""might import more power"" by increasing the use of undersea electricity cables known as interconnectors.

The extra electricity imports might come from nuclear in France, wind in Denmark or hydro in Norway, but it could also mean more from gas generation too.

""Certainly the net impacts will be to lift overall fossil fuel generation, whether that's in the UK or elsewhere in Europe,"" said Mr Rickson.

With more fossil fuel generation comes more emissions of greenhouse gases, which governments are trying to cut in order to reign in climate change.

The prime minister Rishi Sunak in September watered down some climate measures on the basis the UK was on track to meet its target to cut emissions by 68% by 2030.

But the country is now missing an important part of that plan - Hinkley was due to provide 3.2GW of clean power from 2027.

That's about 7% of the UK's electricity, and enough to power six million homes.

""The most significant impact from a UK perspective will be higher greenhouse emissions,"" said Robert Sansom, energy consultant for the Institution of Engineering and Technology.

Tom Greatrex, chief executive of business group the Nuclear industry Association, said: ""Without more nuclear and renewables, it's inevitable that we'll burn more gas.""

""Hinkley will produce clean, reliable power for around 80 years, stretching into the next century, and alongside other stations it will complement wind and solar with a baseload of power available whatever the weather.""

UK plans to 'revive' nuclear power

Once upon a time Hinkley was slated to produce power from 2017, but it has been plagued by setbacks and delays, as have two similar plants in Finland and France.

Operator EDF blames Hinkley's woes on inflation, the COVID-19 pandemic, Brexit and reportedly thousands of extra additional design changes required by the UK regulator.

The government last month set out plans to radically increase the UK's nuclear capacity and simplify and accelerate the process.

Industry says future projects can be built faster and cheaper if projects are less spread out in time, and thanks to what is learned from building Hinkley.

The UK hasn't built any new nuclear projects since Sizewell B was finished in 1995.

Eight of its 9 reactors are due to retire by 2028, and have already had their lives extended, meaning they are unlikely to plug the gap left by Hinkley either.

A spokesperson for the energy security and net zero department said: ""We have the right energy mix to meet our net zero targets - investing in renewables, building the five largest operational offshore wind farms in the world, and supporting the revival of nuclear power.""",Hinkley Point C was due to provide 7% of the UK's electricity from 2027.

2024-02-01,XL bully ban comes into force as police chief urges owners to comply with authorities,"The total number of XL bullies, estimated by animal groups, has ranged between 50,000 and 100,000.

It is now a criminal offence to own an XL bully dog in England and Wales without an exemption certificate.

Unregistered pets can be seized and owners fined and prosecuted, with a police chief urging owners of the illegal animals to comply with officers if their dog is taken because their behaviour may influence a court's decision to have it put down.

Around 40,000 of the large bulldog-type American breed are believed to have been registered before the deadline yesterday, but there may be thousands more without certificates.

National Police Chiefs' Council dangerous dogs lead, Assistant Chief Constable (ACC) Mark Hobrough has urged members of the public to report any XL bully owners not following the rules so officers can assess the animals.

Seized dogs will be taken to kennels before a court decides if they should either be destroyed or deemed not a danger to public safety.

ACC Hobrough said: ""I would encourage strongly people to be compliant if that were the situation with their own dogs because one of the very tests that is made about a dog or an owner (in court) is that the dog is not aggressive, but also that the owner is fit and responsible and not aggressive also.

""So if either of those things were not complied with, then there would be no option for a court then but to destroy the dog.""

The recent ban may spark higher demand for kennels and cause ""logistical challenges"" for officers, ACC Hobrough said, with police forces ""actively looking to enhance"" the numbers they can hold.

There are 137 dog legislation officers across the country, with at least one in every force.

The total number of XL bullies, estimated by animal groups, has ranged between 50,000 and 100,000, the RSPCA has said.

How experts predict XL bully ban will change things in 2024

Figures show between 2001 and 2021 there were three fatal dog attacks a year, compared with 23 over the two-year period after that, with XL bullies said to be behind many of them.

The breed was added to the Dangerous Dogs Act on 31 October last year when restrictions came into force dictating the dogs must be kept on a lead and muzzled in public.

Breeding, selling or abandoning the dogs also became illegal as of 31 December 2023.

Owners of XL bully dogs in Scotland will also be subject at a later date to the safeguards after the Scottish government replicated legislation in place south of the border.

A decision on whether to add to the list of banned breeds in Northern Ireland would be for locally elected ministers.

2024-02-01,Companies increasingly using AI for recruiting - and why it could cost you your job,"Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player

The UK ranks second among countries using artificial intelligence (AI) in recruiting and human resources, the latest figures show.

Some 41% of companies use AI to ""improve recruiting and human resources"", according to a study of 20 countries in November last year by IBM, the technology company.

The UK ranked joint second with the United Arab Emirates, above the United States and below India, for the use of AI tools to support human resource needs like hiring, firing and training workers.

The survey covered five continents but excluded Africa.

Figures on the use of AI in work must be taken with a pinch of salt because different companies define the use of AI differently, but the overall trend is that companies are increasingly using AI for human resources, and the UK is one of the frontrunners in this space.

AI is used by companies to scan CVs and score candidates based on who it predicts is the best match, as well as to analyse candidates' body language and facial expressions in video interviews.

It comes amid a significant jump in the number of job applications last year on LinkedIn, the social network for careers. The number of LinkedIn applications per person surged by 23% in 2023 compared with the year before.

Software companies are also advertising AI tools that can check if an employee is at risk of resigning based on metrics like their pay and work history.

'I thought I was going mad'

Anthea Mairoudhiou, a former MAC makeup artist, was laid off from her role in 2020 based on the results of a video interview conducted using HireVue, a recruitment company based in the United States, that used AI facial analysis technology to mark candidates.

Staff at the company were required to reapply for their jobs after being put on furlough, with the video interview comprising part of the assessment.

Ms Mairoudhiou scored full marks for her performance but lost her job because her body language was marked poorly in the HireVue interview.

HireVue removed the facial analysis function from all new assessments in early 2020 after a number of workers raised concerns.

Ms Mairoudhiou took legal action against Estee Lauder, the parent company of MAC Cosmetics, and agreed on a settlement out of court.

However, the experience had a lasting impact on her health.

""I just thought it was the end of the road of that career, a career that I've worked really hard in,"" she said. ""And, mentally it massively affected me. I felt very let down, and I thought I was going mad.""

AI tools 'save companies a lot of money'

The author Hilke Schellman spoke to developers and whistleblowers at companies offering AI software for employers for her book The Algorithm.

""We have really seen very little evidence that the tools pick the most qualified candidates. But they save companies a lot of money,"" she said of her findings.

""We know that the tools are very cost-efficient. They save companies a lot of money in labour.""

Calls for regulation

There are growing concerns workers in the UK do not know when these tools are being used on them and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) is calling for regulations to be put in place to protect them.

Robin Allen, a barrister at the Cloisters AI law consultancy, said: ""The first step is to recognise that this requires regulation. It's not good enough to simply expect employers to work to ethical standards.

""When we have these technology systems in the workplace, there have to be people who are capable of saying, the computer's got it wrong.""

HireVue and Estee Lauder, the parent company of MAC Cosmetics, were approached for comment.","Some 41% of companies use AI to ""improve recruiting and human resources"" The UK ranked joint second with the United Arab Emirates, above the United States and below India.

2024-02-01,Glenn Close says Robin Williams would still be alive if Christopher Reeve hadn't died,"The Superman actor and the comic had been close for decades after rooming together at The Juilliard School in New York in 1973.

Glenn Close has claimed Robin Williams ""would still be alive"" if his friend Christopher Reeve hadn't died in 2004.

Williams, who took his own life in 2014, was close friends with the Superman actor, who passed away nine years after a horse-riding accident left him paralysed in 1995.

In a new documentary, titled Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story, many areas of Reeve's life are explored, including his friendship with the comedian and actor.

Speaking in the film, Fatal Attraction star Close says: ""I always felt that if Chris was still around, Robin would still be alive.""

Williams and Reeve had been close for decades after rooming together at The Juilliard School in New York in 1973.

At the time of his death, Williams was suffering from Lewy body dementia, an incurable brain disease which had been misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease.

Many of the Good Will Hunting star's friends and colleagues recalled that Williams' deteriorating health led to an intense depression that left him ""sobbing"" and believing he no longer knew ""how to be funny"".

This is not the first time Close has said she thought Williams would still be alive if Reeve was too.

ET News reported in 2017 that, while speaking at the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation's annual charity gala, Close described Williams and Reeves's ""connection"" as ""the stuff of legend"".

""It not only endured, but became a life-giving force sustaining them both,"" she said.

Recalling how, during her time filming The World According to Garp with Williams in 1982, Reeves ""would literally swoop in, piloting his own plane, scoop Robin up, and away they would fly for the weekend"".

""On Sunday, late afternoon, Chris would swoop back in and deliver Robin back - I have to say a little worse for wear.""

She said the pair were ""on top of the world"" when they spent time together, adding: ""They were living the kind of fast and crazy life that our business can hand to you if you become a wildly famous phenomenon, practically overnight.""

""I am convinced that if Chris were still with us, Robin would be too.""

2024-02-01,Aung San Suu Kyi's son receives handwritten letter from imprisoned former Myanmar leader after three years of silence,"After three years of complete silence and no information as to her whereabouts, the family of Aung San Suu Kyi have received their first communication from the former leader of Myanmar since she was removed from power three years ago today.

In a handwritten letter to her son Kim Aris, who lives in the UK, she says she's generally well but is suffering from dental problems and spondylitis, a painful condition that inflames the joints of the backbone.

The letter, her son says, is the first confirmation they have received that the 78-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner is alive.

Mr Aris says he recognised his mother's handwriting straight away.

""I was overjoyed to actually see something in her handwriting, to know that she's able to actually write, for starters, because I haven't had any confirmation that she's actually alive for all these years,"" he says in an interview with Sky News.

Ms Suu Kyi is serving a 33-year prison sentence on corruption charges her supporters say were made up to keep her from power.

The military junta, which severely restricts her contact with the outside world, allowed her to receive a care package from her family and gave her permission to write what is basically a thank you letter, Mr Aris says.

He received the letter in early January this year.

""She sounded well in terms of her spirits, but she always does,"" he says when asked if she gave any insight into how she was being treated.

He adds there was little detail in the letter other than a thank you for the care package because she's aware their communications will be read and will be stopped altogether if she attempted to say more.

Suu Kyi likely in solitary confinement

Mr Aris says his family has no idea where she is being held, or if she has any knowledge of what's happening on the outside, only that they have reason to believe she is in solitary confinement.

""I don't know if she's able to get much news outside of the prison, as far as I am aware she is being held apart from all the other prisoners - essentially in solitary confinement but I don't know whether she's in a cell or whether she's in a room in a barracks or if they've built her a separate cell like they have done in the past,"" he says.

""I do know that she's never accepted any preferential treatment to the other prisoners, so if she is being held separate to the other prisoners and in similar sorts of conditions to them than I can only imagine it's pretty dire.""

Mr Aris says his mother hasn't seen her lawyers in over a year, and her only contact with an outside official was a visit from Thailand's foreign minister, who met her in July last year.

Maps and charts reveal scale of death and destruction in Myanmar

Why the risk of going to Myanmar was worth taking

Junta brutally suppressed all opposition

Exactly three years ago the military junta seized control of the country on the day a new parliament was due to be sworn in.

The coup was greeted with massive protests on the streets of the country's cities, within days the junta deployed police and army units who brutally suppressed all opposition. The protests went on for a year, and at least 1,500 protesters were said to have been killed in that time.

Myanmar - also known as Burma - is now embroiled in a nationwide civil war, with ethnic armies and militia groups made up of civilian volunteers attacking the junta's forces.

Civilian population continuously targeted

Last year I quietly entered Myanmar and spent a month with the resistance movement in the jungles and countryside.

As the uprising has spread the junta has continuously targeted the civilian population, regularly bombing villages, medical centres, churches, and community buildings, with a campaign of artillery strikes and missile attacks from jets and helicopter gunships.

I saw this first-hand while I was there.

Intense fighting but opposition forces have momentum

In recent weeks the resistance movement has made significant gains against the military, and there are reports that thousands of government soldiers have defected to the opposition or deserted from their posts.

I've been speaking to contacts inside the country, who tell me the fighting is intense, but there is a general feeling the opposition forces have momentum.

One of the surgeons at a hospital I spent time at last year says the hospital is overflowing with patients and they continue to treat soldiers and civilians injured on the battlefield.

The chief surgeon at the hospital says they are in surgery all day, every day, until 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning.

""Now all beds in the hospital are full,"" Dr Myo Khant Ko Ko writes. ""Various types of injuries, head, neck, chest, abdomen, limb fractures and amputations."" Some patients have severe injuries to their eyes and jaws, he adds.

Mobile phone videos sent to me by frontline medics, the Free Burma Rangers, verify Dr Myo's account. The videos show badly injured opposition fighters on the frontline being treated by medics. FBR says the fighting has intensified once again.

In a statement, the UN Special Rapporteur for the situation of human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews said: ""The junta is responding to humiliating losses by attacking civilians with aerial and artillery bombardments of towns and villages captured by opposition forces.

""The junta's crimes are enabled by a robust supply of sophisticated weapons from sources outside Myanmar. This creates both an opportunity and an obligation for the international community to act.""

Junta continues to attack civilians

Despite sanctions and condemnation from the international community the junta has continued to attack civilians, forcing hundreds of thousands to leave their homes, and many are now living in self-made camps in the jungle.

Very little international aid is being allowed into the country, and all access into Myanmar is strictly limited, especially for aid agencies and foreign journalists.

With all the conflicts in the world right now, particularly the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, the civil war in Myanmar hardly makes news.

'So many people haven't even heard of Burma'

""Burma has always had a hard time getting the headlines over the years, and now is no different, there always seems to be something cropping up that does overshadow what's happening in Burma, and still so many people haven't even heard of Burma, never mind that there is a civil war, a full-blown civil war going on,"" Ms Suu Kyi's son Mr Aris says.

The ruling military's hope has always been that by forcing civilians from their homes, the people would eventually turn on the opposition, but against their expectations this has not happened. If anything, civilians appear to have increased their support for the armed opposition groups.

The hope, Mr Aris says, is that the military starts to feel pressure from within, unravelling their ambitions.

""I hope that they [the military] will collapse without too much more fighting with everybody else, the stresses going on within should hopefully finish them off, but we can't hope for that, so everybody has got to keep pushing.""",Aung San Suu Kyi is serving a 33-year prison sentence on corruption charges.

2024-02-01,MPs fear watering down of buffer zone rules at abortion clinics,"Cross-party MPs will meet with the home secretary today to query the government's plans allowing protesters to engage in ""silent prayer"" and approach women with leaflets inside buffer zones around abortion clinics.

Despite MPs voting over a year ago to ban these activities, draft guidance released by the Home Office now appears to water down the laws, campaigners have said.

""Safe access zones"" were meant to be introduced to create a 150m-wide area outside clinics to stop anti-abortion campaigners from handing out leaflets, holding vigils and showing graphic images to women near the sites.

But under draft guidance from the government for councils, police and abortion providers, it appears protesters would still be able to approach vulnerable women seeking treatment on their way into clinics.

Another exception also allows for ""silent prayer"" within the 150m protection zones.

Labour's Rupa Huq and Conservative Sir Bernard Jenkin - who originally tabled the amendment to the Public Order Act on the issue - are meeting with Home Secretary James Cleverly to discuss the guidance, Sky News understands.

The MPs believe the exceptions in the draft guidance would still amount to the harassment of women who are seeking abortions and that it could risk undermining the original law agreed by parliament.

The Home Office has recently ended a public consultation on the issue and will finalise guidance by the spring.

A spokesperson from the department said: ""It is completely unacceptable that anyone should feel harassed or intimidated whilst exercising their legal right to access abortion services.

""We are currently considering all responses to the consultation and final guidance will be published in due course.""","MPs to meet with Home Secretary to query government's plans allowing protesters to engage in ""silent prayer"" and approach women with leaflets inside buffer zones around abortion clinics.

2024-02-01,Alec Baldwin pleads not guilty to involuntary manslaughter in Rust shooting,"Halyna Hutchins was shot and killed in 2021 during filming of the western movie in New Mexico after a gun the actor was holding went off.

Alec Baldwin has plead not guilty to a charge of involuntary manslaughter over the on-set shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.

Ms Hutchins was shot and killed during filming of the western movie Rust in New Mexico after a gun the actor was holding went off.

Baldwin made the plea as he waived his right to an arraignment after he was indicted by a grand jury on 19 January, according to court documents.

Waiving the right to an arraignment means the defendant does not have to appear in court to enter their plea, a lawyer can do it for them.

Baldwin was not present at the court.

The ""30 Rock"" actor was allowed to remain free without posting bail under the arraignment waiver with the First Judicial District Court in Santa Fe.

Baldwin was originally charged over the shooting in January 2023.

Those charges were dropped a few months later based on evidence the hammer of the revolver might have been modified, allowing it to fire without the trigger being pulled.

The new charges came after an independent forensic test concluding that Baldwin would have had to have pulled the

trigger of the revolver he was using in a rehearsal for it to fire the live round that struck Hutchins in the chest and killed her.

The finding was the same as a previous FBI test on the firearm.

Baldwin has denied pulling the trigger and said he was not responsible for the death of Hutchins.

The movie's director, Joel Souza, was struck and wounded in the shoulder by the same bullet that killed Hutchins during production of the film on a set outside Santa Fe.

Rust's chief weapons supervisor, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter and evidence tampering, with her trial scheduled for February.

Filming resumes on Rust

Baldwin's next movie is about a tragic shooting

There have been claims that safety standards on set were lax, though Baldwin and other defendants have disputed it.

According to a police report, assistant director David Halls, who handed the gun to Baldwin, told him it was ""cold"" - meaning it did not contain live ammunition or blank rounds.

Halls said he was unaware it was loaded and last year did a plea deal for a six-month suspended sentence, a $500 fine, 24 hours' community safety and a gun safety class.

2024-02-01,MPs call on government to tackle £4bn council funding gap,"Council services will be at risk if the government doesn't step in to ""fix the £4bn hole"" in local authority finances, MPs have warned.

The Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Committee have released a report into financial distress in the organisations, saying there was ""systemic underfunding of local councils in England"".

The cross-party group called on the next government to reform council tax and overhaul the wider funding system for local authorities ""to ensure council finances are put on a sustainable footing"".

And the chair of the committee, Labour MP Clive Betts, said if the government ""fails to plug this gap, well-run councils could face the very real prospect of effectively going bust"".

Explainer: Why are councils going bankrupt?

The state of council funding has increasingly been in the headlines after the likes of Birmingham City and Nottingham City were effectively declared bankrupt last year.

Last week, Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove announced a £600m support package to help with the ""unprecedented challenges that they have faced"", with the majority going towards social care budgets.

But some council leaders warned it wouldn't be enough and difficult decisions would still need to be made to stretch their budgets.

In the committee's report, the MPs highlighted the rising demand for children's and adults' social care, saying it was ""contributing to unmanageable bills for some local authorities"", and extra funding must be provided ""urgently"".

They also pointed to the cost of services for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities too, calling for a review to ensure sustainable funding and proper access.

And they asked government to avoid re-freezing the local housing allowance (LHA) to stop even higher levels of homelessness.

But the big push from the committee was a full overhaul of the system.

Mr Betts added: ""Long-term reform is vitally needed. The funding model for local councils is broken.

""The business rates system is overly complex and in need of reform. Council tax is outdated and increasingly regressive.

""Councils being forced to hike up council tax, in a forlorn attempt to plug increasingly large holes in their budgets, is unsustainable and unfair to local people who are, year on year, seeing less services while paying more.""

Responding to the report, a Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities spokesperson said: ""We recognise councils are facing challenges and that is why we recently announced an additional £600m support package for councils across England, increasing their overall proposed funding for next year to £64.7bn - a 7.5% increase in cash terms.

""This additional funding has been welcomed by leading local government organisations, but we remain ready to talk to any concerned council about its financial position.""","Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Committee release report into financial distress.

2024-01-31,Mike Freer: Minister to stand down as MP over personal safety fears after death threats and arson attack,"A government minister who avoided being murdered ""by the skin of my teeth"" is stepping down as an MP at the next general election over fears for his personal safety.

Mike Freer, Conservative MP for the north London constituency of Finchley and Golders Green, has faced a series of death threats and was targeted by Ali Harbi Ali - the man who stabbed Southend West MP Sir David Amess to death in 2021.

The justice minister said the ""final straw"" was an attempted arson attack on his constituency office in December.

In an interview with the Daily Mail, he said: ""There comes a point when the threats to your personal safety become too much.""

He and his staff, he said, have started wearing stab vests at scheduled public events in his constituency after learning that Ali had watched his Finchley office before killing Sir David at a constituency surgery.

Mr Freer said: ""I was very lucky that actually on the day [of Ali's attempted attack] I was due to be in Finchley, I happened to change my plans and came into Whitehall.

""Otherwise who knows whether I would have been attacked or survived an attack. He said he came to Finchley to attack me.""

MPs, he said, try to ""make light"" of threats, but that it remained at the back of his mind that he could have been killed.

Mr Freer said he had also received threats from the group Muslims Against Crusades ""about coming to stab me"" and found ""mock Molotov cocktails on the office steps"".

The MP, who has pro-Israel views and represents a heavily Jewish constituency, said ""I don't think we can divorce"" antisemitism from the intimidation.

He has represented the seat, which he won by around 6,600 votes at the last general election, since 2010, beating the Liberal Democrats.

Mr Freer joins a series of MPs who have said they will be stepping down at the next election, which is expected later this year.

Labour's candidate in Finchley and Golders Green, Sarah Sackman, said she was ""shocked"" by the news, adding: ""We should have been able to face each other in the polls based on our ideas and merits.

""Instead, politics is now so often skewed by violent language, hate and the dangers of social media.""

Tory former minister Sir Conor Burns tweeted: ""Totally understandable decision. The drip drip of hate (not exclusively from people on the other side) and remorseless cynicism will drive more people out of politics.""","Mike Freer, MP for Finchley and Golders Green, has faced a series of death threats.

2024-01-31,Jam Master Jay death: Eyewitness identifies suspected killer of Run-DMC star,"The DJ was fatally shot in his New York studio in 2002. Uriel Rincon was at the scene when it happened and after years of telling investigators that he couldn't identify the killer, he pointed to who he believed murdered the star.

An eyewitness at the scene of the fatal shooting of Run-DMC star Jam Master Jay has identified the suspected gunman after 15 years of not being able to recognise him, as the defendant's murder trial continues.

The 37-year-old DJ, whose real name was Jason Mizell, was shot in the head in his New York recording studio in 2002.

He was part of one of the best-known rap acts of the 1980s.

Uriel ""Tony"" Rincon was in the studio when Mizell was killed. He was also wounded in the gunfire.

On Wednesday, Mr Rincon pointed to who he believed was the killer - Karl Jordan Jr - in one of the world's most infamous killings in hip-hop history.

Describing the moment of the DJ's death, Mr Rincon said Jordan ""kind of walked directly to Jay and gave, like, half a handshake, with an arm.

""And at the same time, that's when I hear a couple of shots,"" he told the jurors at the New York City courtroom.

In 2020, Jordan, who was Mizell's godson, and the star's childhood friend Ronald Washington, were charged with murder - to which they have pleaded not guilty.

Mr Rincon said he was looking down at his ringing phone when the gunfire erupted, then looked up again.

""And then I see Jay just fall,"" he said.

Mr Rincon then described the pain in his leg having realised he had been shot and that Jam Master Jay was severely wounded.

""I'm trying to tend to my wound, and at the same time, I'm trying to give Jay attention - asking him is he OK? Can he talk? And he is just not responding,"" Mr Rincon said.

He said that during the shooting, Washington was at the studio door, telling another witness to get on the ground and stay there.

Prosecutors previously said Jordan and Washington were motivated by greed and revenge, after being cut out of a lucrative cocaine deal set up by Mizell.

If convicted, they could face at least 20 years behind bars.

The death penalty is not being sought for either defendant.

Jordan's lawyer, John Diaz, said his client wasn't even at the studio on the night of the shooting.

His legal team has said in court documents that Jordan, then 18, was at his pregnant girlfriend's home at the time of Mizell's death and witnesses could state that.

Washington's lawyer Ezra Spilke argued the case was held together with ""tape and glue"" and stated prosecutors have ""no clue"" who killed the DJ.

One of the lawyers, Mark DeMarco, said while questioning Mr Rincon that the witness repeatedly told investigators for years that he had not quite seen and could not identify the gunman.

""I was confused and scared and not trusting a lot of things that were happening,"" Mr Rincon said.

""I didn't understand what I saw, and I didn't understand why or who - because, again, it was somebody I knew. So that's why it was hard for me to grasp,"" he said.

He finally named Jordan and Washington to authorities in 2017.

When asked why he finally did so, Mr Rincon said he thought of Mr Mizell's surviving family.

""I felt that his wife and his children needed closure, and I felt that they should know what took place,"" he said.

Run-DMC also included rappers Joe ""Run"" Simmons and Darryl ""DMC"" McDaniels, and they had hits such as King Of Rock, It's Tricky and a reworking of Aerosmith's Walk This Way.",DJ Jam Master Jay was shot in the head in his New York studio in 2002.

2024-01-31,Sir Keir Starmer promises to 'fix unprecedented stagnation' as Labour targets business voters,"Sir Keir Starmer will promise to ""fix unprecedented stagnation"" in the growth of productivity in the UK, as he unveils Labour's ""plan for business"".

The party leader and his shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will host hundreds of business leaders and investors at a central London event on Thursday, as the pair seek to win over the corporate community ahead of the next election.

Sir Keir will claim the attendance of so many c-level executives at the gathering shows the ""depth of the changes we've made to transform the Labour Party's relationship with business"", saying it was something he took ""immense pride in"".

And he will attack the Conservatives for their record in power over the past 14 years.

The Labour leader is expected to say: ""It's not just the permanent cycle of crisis, there is something much more fundamentally broken in the way this country creates wealth.

""Fifteen years of lost wage growth and an economy with weak foundations that, even in the calmer moments, can't provide the security working people need to look forward doesn't just hold back our potential but also rips up the contract and values that keep a country together.

""It undermines the sense that if you work hard and play by the rules, you will have a chance in Britain and the future will be better for your children.""

Sir Keir will promise to ""deliver growth and prosperity across every corner of the nation"" with Labour's five-point plan for business if the party gets into power at the next election.

Although little detail has been provided yet, the headlines of each step have been outlined, namely:

* ""To get Britain building again after 14 years of stagnation"";

* ""Plans for skills to drive growth"";

* ""The need to partner with business to make work pay for working people"";

* ""Backing British business"";

* ""Creating the stable economic conditions required for delivering growth"".

The party said this ""growth mission"" will line up with Labour's existing pledge to achieve the highest sustained growth in the G7.

Sir Keir will tell business leaders: ""Today we launch this new plan, this new purpose, this new partnership with five priorities to unite behind.

""Five steps we can take together to begin our walk towards a Britain with its future back.""","Sir Keir Starmer will promise to ""fix unprecedented stagnation"" in the growth of productivity in the UK.

2024-01-31,"Transgender children could be 'forcibly outed' under new proposals, charities warn","The plans will ""erase decades of progress"", the charities have warned, and ministers should withdraw the guidance and ""rethink"" their approach.

Transgender children will be ""forcibly outed"" under the government's draft guidance on gender identity in schools, according to a coalition of charities.

A joint statement by a group of organisations including Mermaids, Stonewall, and Amnesty International UK, said the guidance ""seeks to deny the existence of transgender pupils, discouraging them from coming out and being their authentic selves, and could lead to young people being forcibly outed to parents and teachers"".

The long-awaited draft guidance was issued in December, and offered proposals for schools and colleges in England on how best to support pupils who are questioning their gender.

It said ""parents should not be excluded"" from decisions taken by a school or college relating to requests for a child to ""socially transition"", or in other words, a child who wishes to change their name, pronoun or their clothing.

'A risk of significant harm'

Exceptions are allowed in ""rare"" circumstances ""where involving parents would constitute a significant risk of harm to the child"".

It also said teachers and staff should ""not be required"" to adopt the child's chosen pronoun, and should not have to accept all requests for social transition.

But the charities have said the proposals will ""erase decades of progress in making schools places that value difference and reject discrimination"".

They want ministers to withdraw the guidance and ""rethink"" their approach, and some of the signatories have published their own guide for those responding to the consultation, advising ""schools and colleges should only engage with parents with the explicit consent of the child or young person in question"".

'Lots of individual interpretation'

When the Department for Education guidance was published before Christmas, Sky News heard from schools and parents with experience of children questioning their gender at school.

Kevin Sexton, executive headteacher at Chesterfield school in Liverpool, said the draft guidance offers a ""pragmatic pathway"" advising schools, though still left ""lots of areas"" for individual interpretation.

But one parent who we called Carrie, to protect her identity, spoke of her ""scary"" experience as the school her child attended changed her child's name and pronouns without consulting her.

2024-01-31,Callum Hudson-Odoi says he would confront racist fans face to face,"Callum Hudson-Odoi is weary recounting the racism.

They are painful memories - of abuse playing for England and Chelsea, and too often online - that the Nottingham Forest winger would rather forget.

But speaking up is about ensuring the next generation of black players can, hopefully, just focus on football without facing hate in their place of work.

""It's very frustrating,"" Hudson-Odoi told Sky News. ""It's more anger and disappointment, if anything.

""I think for the fact that it just keeps happening and the amount of times I think players and staff and everybody has spoken about it, about trying to stop the whole situation in general.

""I think it's annoying to hear that things are still happening and situations occur and people think it's right to say some things and do certain chants.""

The 23-year-old had just emerged from a summit of players past and present along with academics convened by Forest to form a call for action to demand change.

He sat with teammates for hours listening to how prejudice can still be a barrier to a safe sport.

Thierry Henry spoke of the history of black people being marginalised by society.

His fellow France 1998 World Cup winner, Lilian Thuram, told of how too often the responsibility falls on black players to eradicate racism and how institutions don't want to change.

The global governing bodies can react to particular incidents with tough talk - as happened earlier this month after the racist abuse of AC Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan by Udinese fans sparked a player walk-off.

""When you hear something like that you don't want to be playing anymore,"" Hudson-Odoi said.

""All you're trying to do is just play the game and be happy and try and get a result for the team. So I think for us it hurts a lot of the time.

""And I think sometimes the referees could do more and say, 'OK look you have to stop the game', abandon the game, get the fans out of the stadium who have done it.

""Or some of the players taking a gesture to help to understand that, 'Listen, we're not playing no more. We're not doing this until some things are done'.""

Football racist abuse should trigger automatic match forfeit

Hudson-Odoi would confront racist fans face to face one day.

""I think I would want to ask the question of why,"" he said. ""What made you do that? What made you say that? What's the reason why you're being racist. Do you get a joke out of it? Is it a laugh?""

It's not just about trying to understand their warped motives but for them to know the impact of their toxic actions.

""I think your mentality really just goes because of the fact that you feel ashamed,"" Hudson-Odoi said. ""You feel kind of embarrassed and you don't feel yourself on the pitch.""

And by speaking out, Hudson-Odoi hopes player activism can make football safer.

""For the next generation that will come up after us... I think they're going to come up and see everything and be like, 'OK, yeah, they've done a lot in their time to make sure that everything that we have now is not the same as they faced,"" he said.

2024-01-31,Jeremy Hunt casts doubt on big tax cuts at next budget,"Jeremy Hunt has cast doubts over introducing big tax cuts at the next budget, saying he is unlikely to have the fiscal ""room"" he had in the autumn.

Earlier this month, the chancellor hinted at further reductions come 6 March, saying the government's plan of ""prioritising tax cuts"" was working, and that it would ""stick to it"".

Politics live: Minister makes awkward admission about his brief

The comments followed his decision in the autumn statement to reduce national insurance by two percentage points, with the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) saying it would cost the Treasury £9.76bn in the 2028 tax year.

But speaking to ITV, he confirmed reports he had warned the cabinet he may not be able to go that far in what could be the last big fiscal moment before a general election.

""We go through a process ahead of every budget and autumn statement where you don't actually know the final numbers until a couple of weeks before, and we're still in the middle of that process,"" he said.

""As things stand at the moment - things can change - it doesn't look like I'll have the kind of room that I had for those very big tax cuts in the autumn.

""And I did mention that to the cabinet, yes.""

Mr Hunt's remarks come a day after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) advised the UK Treasury not to cut taxes, and expressed scepticism about the chancellor's spending plans for the coming years - raising questions about his ability to meet his own fiscal rules.

The economic body said: ""Preserving high-quality public services, and undertaking critical public investments to boost growth and achieve the net zero targets, will imply higher spending needs over the medium term than are currently reflected in the government's budget plans.""

A reservist who dealt with the aftermath of the Hamas attack on 7 October says there was a ""systematic genital mutilation"" of women as multiple victims were shot in the crotch, breasts and head.

Warning - contains graphic details of injuries

Shari Mendes was part of an Israeli army reserve unit whose role was to identify and prepare female soldiers for burial.

She told Sky's Yalda Hakim she was at the Shura base on 8 October, where victims were brought the day after the attack that killed more than 1,200 people.

""The halls were lined to the ceiling with body bags, the smell was unimaginable. I can't tell you the shock and despair that struck all of us,"" said Ms Mendes.

Middle East latest: US destroys Houthi missile 'preparing to launch'

Her unit performed a religious role, ""accompanying"" the female victims and preparing them for burial in white linen.

""It was our job to honour them, they could have been our daughters - they were the same ages as our children... Just for a moment we loved them,"" she told Sky News.

Ms Mendes said women came in barely dressed, some with bloody underwear, and their injuries were something none of her team was prepared for.

""Women were shot many times in the face... Their mouths were in grimaces, their eyes were open, their fists were clenched,"" she said.

""They were shot so many times in the head, in many cases it was like there was purposeful obliteration of women's faces.

""Our team has seen women shot in the crotch, in the genitals. Women were shot in the breast... Our team saw this.""

She added: ""Women had legs cut off. It seemed like there was a systematic genital mutilation of women in the women we saw.""

Hamas has previously denied its fighters raped anyone during the attack, saying it would contradict Islamic teaching.

'Booby-trapped bodies'

Ms Mendes said many victims were so badly damaged that she and her colleagues struggled to dress them for burial in the customary white linen.

She told Sky News: ""One woman had her arm and her leg broken in so many places it was like handling marbles or sand, and at a certain point we said we would just put a white sheet on top of her.""

Witnesses and others who dealt with the attack, particularly the massacre at the Nova music festival, have also described terrible injuries to women and said rape appeared to have been used as a tactic.

Ms Mendes also said the base had to be evacuated on occasion because some victims arrived ""booby trapped"".

She said other women who may have been subjected to sexual violence during the attack could be staying silent, fearful of not being believed.

""If these women are being questioned about the veracity of their claims, why should they come forward?"" she said.

""I think we have to be patient: they're very traumatised... It may take time for these women to speak out, if they ever do.""","Shari Mendes was part of an Israeli army reserve unit whose role was to identify and prepare female soldiers for burial.

2024-01-31,'Blood on your hands': Mark Zuckerberg among social media bosses grilled over child exploitation concerns,"Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player

Mark Zuckerberg was one of several social media bosses accused of having ""blood on [their] hands"" at a hearing where companies were criticised for not doing enough to protect children from being exploited on their platforms.

Mr Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, faced a sea of people who held pictures of their dead children all affected by online harms.

Also at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing were the chiefs of X, Linda Yaccarino, Snap Inc's Evan Spiegel, TikTok's Shou Zi Chew and Discord's Jason Citron.

All were grilled by US senators about inadequate protections online for children who, some politicians and activists argue, are susceptible to sexual predators, eating disorder content, unrealistic beauty standards and bullying on the platforms.

The room was first shown a video of children speaking about their victimisation on social media and senators recounted stories of young people taking their lives while being extorted after sharing photos with sexual predators.

Senator Lindsey Graham said: ""Mr Zuckerberg, you and the companies before us, I know you don't mean it to be so, but you have blood on your hands.""

Referring to the founder of Facebook specifically, Mr Graham said: ""You have a product that's killing people.""

Mr Zuckerberg apologised to the families present, saying: ""I'm sorry for everything you have all been through.

""No one should go through the things that your families have suffered and this is why we invest so much and we are going to continue doing industry-wide efforts to make sure no one has to go through the things your families have had to suffer.""

Instagram, which is operated by Meta, was further denounced as one of its features included alerting a user to an image that might show sexual abuse but allowed them to see it anyway.

Mr Zuckerberg responded that it can be helpful to redirect users to resources rather than blocking content. He reiterated the company had no plans to pursue a previous idea to create a child version of the app.

Meta has said it will block harmful content from being viewed by under-18s, and will instead share resources from mental health charities when someone posts about their struggles with self-harm or eating disorders.

The 39-year-old chief executive has faced a committee before, with the first being over a privacy scandal in 2018 for Cambridge Analytica.

It is only the second time for Mr Chew and the first for Ms Yaccarino.

X has faced heavy criticism since Elon Musk's takeover of the platform, and this week has been embroiled in a deepfake scandal, when sexually explicit pictures appearing to show Taylor Swift went viral.

Her name was temporarily unsearchable as the platform sought to redress the situation.

What did the other chiefs have to say?

The boss of X said the company did not cater to children and the firm supported the STOP CSAM Act, a bill which facilitates restitution for victims of child exploitation.

It is one of several aimed at addressing child safety - but none have become law.

Meanwhile, TikTok's chief executive was grilled on the app's potential detriment to the mental health of children.

Mr Chew insisted his platform made ""careful product design choices to help make our app inhospitable to those seeking to harm teens"", reiterating the enforcement of a policy that would ban children under 13 from using the app.

He also said TikTok would spend $2bn (£1.57bn) on trust and safety measures.

Discord's boss said safety tools already existed on its platforms, adding it had worked with NGOs and law enforcement to protect children.

Before the hearing, Mr Spiegel, the chief executive of Snap Inc, which operates Snapchat, said the company would back a bill to hold apps and social media platforms legally accountable if they recommended harmful material to children.","Social media bosses accused of having ""blood on their hands"" at hearing.

2024-01-31,Peter Norgrove: Builder jailed for life for murder of Sharon Gordon in 'savage and brutal' hammer attack,"A builder who killed an unhappy customer in a ""brutal and savage"" hammer attack, has been jailed for life.

Peter Norgrove, 43, will serve a minimum of 15 years for murdering 58-year-old Sharon Gordon, who was found with severe skull fractures at her home in July last year.

Ms Gordon paid the recently qualified bricklayer £29,000 to build an extension to her house in Dudley, within two months, but it was more than a year behind schedule.

Wolverhampton Crown Court heard Norgrove, from Sedgley, had admitted murder at a previous hearing.

The tradesman was caught on doorbell and security camera footage entering the house via the back door while wearing gloves and leaving with red marks on his trousers, at around 2pm, on 20 July.

Bloodstained items were found in a wheelie bin at a family address linked to Norgrove and a hammer was found hidden in a shed at the victim's home, the court heard.

During sentencing, Judge Michael Chambers KC said Ms Gordon may have lived for up to an hour after the attack, and told Norgrove: ""You went into the house, having put gloves on. You made no attempts to seek help.

""You used a hammer to repeatedly strike her to the head. You were angry because she had continued to criticise you for your chronic delays and workmanship.""

The ""brutal and savage"" attack involved eight blows to the head, the judge said, and was made worse when Norgrove told police his victim was alive and well when he left the property.

Mr Chambers said: ""The principal aggravating factor is this was a brutal and savage attack in the victim's home, using a weapon. She would have been no match for you. There was clearly an intention to kill.""

Prosecutor Earl Pinnock told the court the Ring doorbell at the house recorded noises lasting 18 seconds, during which time, ""a female voice screamed momentarily and then shouted something inaudible"".

The pair had been introduced by a mutual friend at the Jehovah's Witnesses Kingdom Hall they attended, the court heard, and Norgrove, a married father, had picked a child up from school and then led a service at the hall after the murder.

Ms Gordon, described as a kind and generous woman with strong faith and values, was found dead the following day by two friends who visited the property.

Detective Inspector Damian Forrest, who led the investigation, said Norgrove lost his temper ""after a disagreement over the work he was carrying out.""

The victim's daughter, Rhian Brown, told the court prior to the sentencing: ""I am tormented at the thought of what my mum endured. Did she cry out for someone? Those thoughts are torture but I can't get them out of my head.

""In her final moments she was faced with shocking violence from someone she thought she could trust. Nothing will ever restore or compensate for what we have lost.""","Peter Norgrove, 43, will serve a minimum of 15 years for murdering 58-year-old Sharon Gordon.

2024-01-31,Fed takes step towards first US rate cut but signals extended caution,"The US central bank has raised expectations that interest rate cuts are around the corner but also signalled that it wants more evidence that easing inflation is sustainable.

The Federal Reserve kept its core interest rate range steady between 5.25%-5.5% following the first meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee in 2024.

Its statement to accompany the decision showed it had dropped a longstanding reference to possible further hikes

in borrowing costs.

It said: ""The committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance"", signalling an improvement in conditions towards a rate cut.

Money latest: Most hated taxes revealed - plus Amazon Prime change imminent

But crucially it added: ""The committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2% - its target rate.""

At a news conference, Fed chair Jay Powell told reporters: ""We do have confidence but we want to get greater

confidence"" that cooling inflation data is sending ""a true signal"".

The remarks saw a shift in financial market expectations for the first rate cut.

The majority of opinion moved to May from March.

The Fed's tightening cycle began in March 2022 when price pressures were ramping up in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Inflation peaked at a 40-year high several months later and the headline rate has eased at a faster pace than in Europe since.

US stocks fell following the release of the Fed's statement while the dollar rose against many currencies though not versus the pound.

That could be a consequence of expectations that the Bank of England will take a harder line on the prospect of rate cuts.

UK rate-setters are widely tipped to leave Bank rate at 5.25% - the level it has sat at since August last year - on Thursday.

While inflation has also eased sharply from the peak above 11% witnessed in 2022, it remains more stubborn than across the Atlantic.

The pace of price increases in the economy remains double the Bank of England's 2% target rate, above 4%.

It was for that reason that policymakers including governor Andrew Bailey have stuck to a script since December that it is too early to think about rate cuts.

Financial markets currently see four reductions in 2024, beginning in May.

The Bank's latest thinking will be revealed in the minutes of the monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting and the accompanying Monetary Policy Report.

Mr Bailey hosts a news conference shortly after the information is released.

The first clue towards any shift in the 'hold' stance will come from the voting among the nine members of the MPC.

2024-01-31,"Russell Brand describes 'appalling' rape, assault and emotional abuse allegations as 'very hurtful'","Russell Brand has described the ""appalling"" allegations against him as ""very, very hurtful"" - as he again denied all wrongdoing.

In September, the actor and comedian was accused of rape, assault and emotional abuse between 2006 and 2013, following a joint investigation by Channel 4 Dispatches, The Times and The Sunday Times.

A documentary about the claims also included allegations of controlling, abusive and predatory behaviour.

One of Brand's accusers claimed she was 16 and still at school when they began a relationship, while another woman said she had been raped at Brand's Los Angeles home.

Another woman told Sky News he made her feel ""vulnerable and intimidated"" and alleged he refused to call her a taxi until she performed a sex act.

The fallout from the claims caused Brand to suspend his tour.

After the documentary aired, other complainants came forward to the BBC and the Metropolitan Police. In November the force reportedly interviewed him. He has not been arrested or charged.

Brand, 48, told Tucker Carlson, in an interview posted on the former Fox News host's YouTube channel on Wednesday, it was ""hurtful"" to be accused of ""what I consider to be the most appalling crimes"".

He added: ""This is very, very painful and very, very hurtful.""

'Public concoction'

The actor, who has starred in films including Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Trolls, revealed the Channel 4 documentary coincided with the birth of his son, who suffered health issues after being born.

He said: ""My son was born with a heart condition. And while this [the documentary airing] was happening he was undergoing heart surgery, he was 12 weeks old and I suppose what that did, Tucker, is it revealed that what we were experiencing was a public concoction.

""I'm aware that I put myself in an extremely vulnerable position by being very, very promiscuous, [but] that is not the type of conduct I endorse and it's certainly not how I would live now.""

He added: ""Of course, I deny any allegations of the kind that have been advanced, and what I have seen is the significance of family and the importance of beliefs that are transcendent of this.""

'Promiscuous lifestyle'

Brand said he had been a ""denizen"" of the entertainment world, where he was ""fostered and adored and celebrated and lived the kind of lifestyle that was kind of common for people in that arena, for single people, and in my case drug and alcohol people... certainly with an appetite for a promiscuous lifestyle"".

In November, the BBC and Channel 4 provided updates on their internal investigations into Brand. The corporation said two more people had come forward with allegations, while Channel 4 said its probe was close to completion.

2024-01-31,Ilaria Salis: Italian woman in chains in Hungarian court sparks outrage,"The activist was arrested in Budapest last year on suspicion of being involved in attacks against participants in Hungary's Day of Honour commemorations.

An Italian woman being bound in chains while appearing in a Hungarian court has sparked outrage in her home nation.

Ilaria Salis, an anti-fascist activist, was arrested in Budapest last year on suspicion of being involved in attacks against participants in Hungary's Day of Honour commemorations.

Each year on 11 February scores of neo-Nazis honour the failed escape attempt by Nazi forces and Hungarian soldiers out of Budapest during the Red Army's siege of the city in 1945.

It also drums up support of vehement anti-fascist demonstrators.

Salis was seen in court being led by a guard with a chain in hand.

She was also handcuffed and her legs shackled limiting her movement, in what has been described as ""humiliating conditions"" by the Italian government.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni spoke to her Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban about Salis's detention, a local news site reported.

The two leaders are on good terms, though this is a delicate situation for the far-right-led government of Ms Meloni.

The Italian foreign ministry called on the Hungarian deputy ambassador to protest after Salis appeared in court earlier in the week.

The ministry cited European and international law calling for the need to respect the dignity of prisoners ""including the way in which defendants are transferred to court and the guarantees of a fair trial"".

It also requested Salis be placed under house arrest instead of being held in prison before her trial - the conditions of which made the front page in Italian newspapers following reports she was bound by the neck in a cell with mice and cockroaches.

The ministry demanded Salis's lawyers have access to a video of the alleged incidents so a defence could be established.

Senate president Ignazio La Russa, who is a member of Ms Meloni's Brothers of Italy party, said Italian law ""prohibits inmates from being exhibited with handcuffs and in conditions of humiliation, whereas this isn't the case in Hungary"".

If Salis is convicted, prosecutors have requested 11 years in prison for her.

The second stage will then come into force from 31 July - with owners being urged to prepare.

Holyrood is replicating the regulations introduced by Westminster, which makes it a criminal offence to own an unlicensed XL bully dog without an exemption certificate.

The new rules were recently implemented in England and Wales following a spate of attacks in which people died or were injured by the breed.

First stage (23 February):

* The dogs must be kept on a lead and muzzled when out in public

* Selling, breeding, abandoning or giving the dogs away will become illegal

Second stage (31 July):

* Owners will have to apply and pay a fee, yet to be confirmed, for their dog to be added to the exemption index. The dog will also have to be microchipped and neutered.

Compensation will be payable to owners who no longer wish to keep their pet, including reimbursement for euthanasia.

Further details on when applications open for an exemption certificate will be announced in the coming weeks.

Those that are convicted of breaching the rules could face up to six months in prison and/or a fine of up to £5,000.

How experts predict XL bully ban will change things in 2024

Community safety minister Siobhian Brown previously stressed that the new rules would be ""safeguards rather than a ban"".

Announcing the dates on Wednesday, she said: ""It is vital XL bully dog owners get ready for the first stage of legal safeguards that will come into force on 23 February.

""These new rules are intended to prevent risks to public safety and animal welfare and keep our communities safe.

""The second stage of legal safeguards will provide owners seeking an exemption an appropriate length of time to decide how to prepare for the forthcoming change in the law ahead of the 31 July deadline.

2024-02-01,England team v Italy live: 23-man squad named for Six Nations clash - latest updates,"Team named at 2pm GMT 1:13PM Fresh faces and old hands

Youth, experience or a bit of both? At 2pm today, Steve Borthwick names his England team to take on Italy in Rome and there are likely to be a few fresh faces in the matchday 23.

Yesterday, our rugby correspondent Daniel Schofield revealed that Fraser Dingwall will make his debut in midfield at inside centre alongside Henry Slade, while fly-half George Ford has been preferred to the uncapped Fin Smith, who must make do with a place on the bench.

And, in perhaps the most surprising selection, Ethan Roots is set to start at blindside flanker alongside Sam Underhill and Ben Earl.

A former cage fighter, Roots represented New Zealand Maori but qualifies to play for England through his father who was born near Reading. With Borthwick understood to be considering a place on the bench for Welsh-born winger Immanuel Feyi-Waboso, there could be four dual-qualified players in England's matchday squad with both Dingwall and Smith having previously been on Scotland's radar.

Roots, meanwhile, came on to Borthwick's radar thanks to Richard Hill, the 2003 World Cup-winning flanker and current team manager.

""When we were in Le Touquet and I was walking through the dining room and saw Richard Hill at his computer watching the Premiership Rugby Cup games,"" Borthwick said of Roots when announcing his squad for the Six Nations. ""He pulled me over and said, 'come and watch this player for the next two minutes'. I watched him with Hilly, and it was outstanding - the work-rate, physicality he brought to it. Hilly said to me there and then, 'track this guy'. If Richard Hill tells me to track a back-row forward, I'm listening. He's got some brain.""",Steve Borthwick names his England squad to face Italy in Rome at 2pm GMT. Fraser Dingwall will make his debut in midfield alongside Henry Slade.

2024-02-01,"Keep an eye out for giant stuffed polar bear, police ask Canadians after bizarre heist","Twelve-foot tall beast named Harry snatched from education centre north of Edmonton

Canadians have been told to keep an eye out for a giant, stuffed polar bear after the 500-pound taxidermied creature was stolen in a bizarre sub-zero heist.

The artefact nicknamed Harry, which is around 12ft tall, was snatched from a resort north of Edmonton when a cold snap hit the area in early January sending temperatures plummeting towards -30C.

Lily Lake Resort's usual 24-hour security patrols were cancelled amid the freezing conditions.

The animal was reported stolen on January 22 and police have asked the public to be alert in case it appears for sale online, dubbing the incident: ""The Heist of the Big Polar Bear.""

Resort worker Wanda Rowe, who reported the incident, said she thought that thieves had cut the cables securing the bear and dragged it outside to a waiting vehicle, leaving marks behind.

""It 100 per cent had to be planned,"" Ms Rowe told the Globe and Mail newspaper.

Taxidermied raccoons also stolen

The healing and education centre is around 30 miles north of Edmonton.

A similar incident occurred on the premises last summer when two taxidermy raccoons were stolen. Harry and the raccoons are thought to be worth some $35,000 in total.

""For us initially it was emotional, because it's been here for so long,"" Ms Rowe said. ""We also felt violated that someone could come in and just take this.""

Constable Kelsey Davidge, of Alberta's Royal Canadian Mounted Police, described the crime as the ""heist of the big polar bear"".

""He was really an icon here, and it's weird to walk by and not see him now,"" she said. ""It feels like something is missing.""

Constable Davidge said police were hopeful the polar bear would be noticed were he to pop up for sale online or appear elsewhere in the local community.

""That would stick out right away, If you saw that anywhere, right?,"" she said.

Canada is home to around 16,000 polar bears, according to government figures, accounting for approximately two-thirds of the global population of the species.

Hunting the creatures, which mostly reside in Arctic regions, is legal in the country's northern territories.","Canadians told to keep an eye out for a giant, stuffed polar bear after it is stolen.

2024-02-01,The poor boy from industrial France who infiltrated the Parisian elite,"In Change, a superb work of autofiction, Édouard Louis retraces his formative teenage years, without sparing himself or the reader

In 2014, a young French man wrote En finir avec Eddy Bellegueule (The End of Eddy). It was a debut novel, though an autofictional one: a harrowing portrait of childhood in a poverty-stricken village in the post-industrial French north, where he endured brutal homophobia. His second book, 2016's Histoire de la violence (History of Violence), then detailed the events of Christmas Eve 2012, when he, at the age of 20, was raped at gunpoint by an Algerian man he'd picked up earlier that evening.

By this point, Eddy Bellegueule had changed his name to Édouard Louis, and moved to Paris to study at the prestigious École normale supérieure. He had become a voracious reader, and had found a friend and mentor in the esteemed philosopher Didier Eribon. All of this fostered his politicisation, as was clear from his next two books, Qui a tué mon père (Who Killed My Father) and Combats et métamorphoses d'une femme (A Woman's Battles and Transformations). This duo of slim but searing works combined excavations of personal bitterness and trauma with dispassionate sociological analysis.

Immediately identifiable as the work of the same author of The End of Eddy and History of Violence, not least because of some repetition of now familiar material, these were, however, presented to the reader as works of non-fiction rather than autofiction. Louis used the grim realities of his mother and father's lives - deprivation, precarity, unforgiving physical labour, ignorance and ingrained racism, sickness and addiction - to illuminate the hardships of France's poorest and most disenfranchised white citizens.

Plenty of lazy critics have fallen foul of the temptation to brand Louis as France's answer to JD Vance, the venture capitalist-turned-United States senator, and author of Hillbilly Elegy, a bestselling 2016 memoir about growing up in Rust-Belt Ohio. Quite aside from the differences between the two men's politics, it's an evaluation that reduces Louis to the role of ethnographer, and his fictional avatar ""Eddy"" to a paint-by-numbers hero in a rags-to-riches story.","Édouard Louis retraces his formative teenage years without sparing himself or the reader.

2024-02-01,Everest with a toddler? Try these far more sensible (and affordable) family adventures,"A two-year-old has become the youngest person to ever reach Base Camp. He might have been happier looking for fossils in Dorset

Most parents of young children will know the panic that ensues when you set off on a family holiday. Did we pack the beach shoes and the baby monitor? Will they sleep OK in an unfamiliar bed?

Not Ross Dallas and his partner Jade, who took their two-year-old son Carter to Everest Base Camp ""on a whim"" in October 2023, during a year-long trip around Asia. Carter is now thought to be the youngest person to ever reach Base Camp. It's undoubtedly an achievement, but was it a sensible one?

""I've seen the video and the kid looks very happy,"" says Andy Moore of Evertrek. ""The only concern I'd have is that we like people to be able to verbalise what's wrong with their body. I've met people walking with their kids in the UK and they're not going to tell you they're cold, unless they're crying. For that reason, we wouldn't take a toddler.""

Many operators refuse to take young children along the route. The local company Discovery World Trekking, which suggests 10 as a younger age limit, notes that altitude sickness can be worse in kids. According to his dad, Carter took it all in his stride though. Whether he'll remember it fondly (or indeed at all) is another matter.

People increasingly want to continue travelling with kids in tow. To accommodate requests for trips with young children, operator Black Tomato has redesigned some of its most epic itineraries - including nights in the Moroccan desert and trips to remote glaciers - with themes inspired by books including Arabian Nights and Treasure Island. Meanwhile, Liddy Pleasants founded the family tour operator Stubborn Mule Travel while biking round Asia with her husband and children aged two and five.

But bucket-list trips are about big tick-offs - and little kids often prefer less extravagant experiences. My own offsprings' favourite holiday to date was in (drum roll) Wales. And the highlight for my son was picking up fresh eggs from the farm shop, despite our determination to pack in forest school, castle-hopping and more.

It goes to show that your toddler's idea of a dream getaway may not match your own. With this in mind, here are five toddler-friendly alternatives to big ticket trips...

Don't go on the Inca Trail, make for the Jurassic Coast

Like Everest trek companies, many Inca Trail operators suggest 10 as a lower age limit for a hike. And though toddlers may fall in love with the area's llamas, they're bound to be nonplussed by Machu Picchu. Instead, show them ancient history they can get on board with along the UK's Jurassic Coast. There are real dinosaur footprints in Purbeck, fossils on East Cliff Beach and ice creams and sandcastles in Lyme Regis too. Stay at Silver Cottage, a child-friendly period house 300 metres from the sea, from £768 per week with Dorset Coastal Cottages.

Don't go on safari, head for the Highlands

Most lodges don't accept toddlers due to safety and safaris are so pricey that you need to be certain all the family will enjoy one. A trip to Perthshire is far less high stakes while toddlers will be just as excited to see red deers and mountain hares as lions and zebras. Take a Highland Safaris from the Red Deer Centre at Aberfeldy and you can bring your own (non-isofix) car seat, as well as feed the deer and meet a barn owl too. Nearby Crieff Hydro has rooms from £240, B&B.

Don't hit the Galapagos, head for Lake Bled

It's possible to go to the Galapagos with toddlers in tow, but it may not be fun for anybody thanks to bumpy hiking trails, complicated island-hopping logistics and a six-hour time difference. For easier water-based exploration, try Slovenia's Lake Bled, where you'll find pushchair-friendly lakeshore trails, a castle to explore, a lido to splash around in and dragonflies, newts and fish to spot. First Choice has a week's B&B at the three-star Bled Rose Hotel, from £889pp.

Don't go to Everest, go to Lake Louise

You can have a mountain adventure without the punishing altitude - and you'll get cake at the end of it too. It takes less than two hours to hike from Lake Louise to the Lake Agnes Tea House at 2,135m, originally a refuge for turn-of-the-century hikers and now a café serving baked goods alongside hot chocolate with marshmallows. Along the way, paths cut through fairy-tale forests populated by chipmunks. Friendly three-star Lake Louise Inn has a pool and rooms from £350, room only. Air Transat flies to Calgary via Montreal, from £680pp.

Don't make for Antarctica, try Switzerland

Even seeing Santa in Lapland can be a trial for tiny kids as temperatures can plummet to -30C; in Antarctica, the gauge barely rises above 0C in summer. For a gentle introduction to snowy climes and far less tears, try the Swiss Riviera which puts on a show geared to little kids when winter rolls around. From Montreux (home to one of Europe's most atmospheric Christmas markets), you can take the funicular up the mountain to Rochers-de-Naye, the snowy home of Santa from around Dec 5 each year. Stay at cute Le Coucou, a chalet straight from Heidi that's half-way back down the mountain and has rooms from £160 B&B.","Ross Dallas and his partner Jade took their two-year-old son Carter to Everest Base Camp ""on a whim"" Many operators refuse to take young children along the route.

2024-02-01,The woman behind the 'deeply strange' costumes in this year's most talked about film,"The real star behind this surprise Oscar contender isn't Emma Stone, it's the fantastical wardrobe assembled by UK designer Holly Waddington

There are so many visual pleasures to be unpicked in Poor Things, the fantastical and provocative Oscar contender; however the film offers a particular treat for fashion lovers. Emma Stone's character Bella Baxter (the child/woman heroine, gruesomely reanimated by Willem Dafoe's Frankenstein-esque scientist) has a wardrobe that could have walked straight off a couture catwalk.

Think super exaggerated leg o' mutton sleeves recalling Alexander McQueen's savage take on Victoriana, touches of the surreal à la Schiaparelli, a strong underwear-as-outerwear-play, and all laced through with a subtle - yet deeply strange - sense of the erotic.

British costume designer Holly Waddington has been nominated for an Oscar, a Bafta and Costume Designers Guild Award for these spectacular creations. And perhaps no less an accolade is the fact you can already buy a knock-off Bella Baxter Halloween costume on eBay for a cool £44.99. ""A bargain,"" deadpans Waddington, 46, when we speak over a Zoom call.

The softly spoken Lancastrian, best known for costuming Lady Macbeth starring Florence Pugh, was brought up in Burnley and began her career at Angels Costumes in London. ""We were trained in how to put clothes together... dating things,"" she says. ""We had costume lessons every day... I would be given a rail of all the things that had gone back to the dry cleaner and come back all muddled up. My training was to date everything and tell my boss: 'I think this is an Edwardian blouse.' Well, why is it an Edwardian blouse? Talk it through. It was really old-fashioned training.""

The playfully maverick director behind Poor Things, Yorgos Lanthimos (The Lobster, The Favourite), was not so interested in the strict conventions of period drama. The brilliant Alasdair Gray novel, upon which the film is based, is set in 1880s Glasgow. However, one of the first visual references that Lanthimos shared with Waddington was a pair of futuristic inflatable trousers by London College of Fashion graduate Harikrishnan. Given the revivification narrative of Poor Things - all about breathing life back into the central character - you can see the logic. But still, pretty wild!

""Yorgos is inherently super modern,"" she says. ""His approach, his voice... everything feels of our time. He's like the voice of our generation, and he's making films that are very unusual and approaching things in a different way. There's a freshness to it.""

When it came to creating the costumes, Waddington admits that designing for a veteran clothes horse has its advantages: ""Emma Stone just looks fantastic in clothes,"" she says, explaining how fittings with the lead actress became a part of the creative process. ""Very early on, I went to meet Emma in Athens with many suitcases full of ideas, loads of shapes, jackets, wedding dresses, all sorts of things that I wanted her to try on and gauge what might work. While I was there, the one look that I felt like I really cracked in that fitting was the bolero jacket with big sleeves and we made toiles of sleeves of different sizes, going up to vast huge things.""

Another costume that crystallised in the fitting process was the formal black frock coat that Bella wears when she becomes a medical student. The look was originally designed as a suit, but in the fitting Stone wanted to lose the skirt to be more Bella. The abbreviated boy/girl tailoring, worn with high lace-up boots, delivers a fierce Nicholas Ghesquiere-for-Louis Vuitton punch.

It's fascinating to hear how Waddington approached dressing the different ages of Bella's topsy-turvy development (at the beginning of the film, we see her toddling around like a baby in a woman's body). ""I just loved this idea that she would have these Victorian clothes and they would all be assembled correctly in the morning by the maid, Mrs Prim, to be properly dressed, not like a child, but a grown-up, and that everything would disassemble during the day; because, this is my observation of little kids and how they play through the day.""

This antic approach to dress and undress, continues even as Bella matures, and sets off on her grand tour in Europe with her dandified lover Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo). The silky yellow shorts she wears in Lisbon, with her blue bolero jacket, are based on 1930s tap pants - basically ladylike knickers. ""I was thinking about Taxi Driver, when Jodie Foster goes out in these little hot pants and sunglasses, and she looks like a child dressed up as a woman. I just wanted that moment when she steps out of the hotel to be really iconic.""

Were there specific fashion designers that Waddington looked at for inspiration? ""I remember early on looking at a lot of Thom Browne stuff... the way that he has these hugely exaggerated body shapes and sleeves. And also Moncler, we were looking at really puffy things that were quilted. Cecilie Bahnsen was another fashion designer that I was really interested in, the way that she does these very childlike, cosseted, quilty clothes. And Simone Rocha was another fashion designer that was really interesting.""

All those tactile, cushiony fabrics contribute to the film's highly textured and wildly surreal production design (try imagining Antoni Gaudí on acid). ""When I first read the script, I felt like everything would have to feel organic and of the body,"" explains Waddington. ""I just wanted to find textures that felt like they were breathing or skin-like. Or if you think about sea creatures, the way that they move... I even thought about cellulite and the dimpled pores of fat... I just wanted everything to feel bodily.""

Ah yes, flesh. There is an awful lot of sex in Poor Things as Bella explores - and challenges - the ways of Victorian patriarchy. Prepared to be fascinated and repelled by brothel keeper Madame Swiney (played with aplomb by Kathryn Hunter), who wears a floor-sweeping number in a burgundy brownish silk (woven to order by Kentish Town fabric house Henry Bertrand). Waddington remarks that the spongy texture reminded her of ""varicose veins"". Incidentally, Swiney's matching turban (Diana Vreeland vibes) was inspired by Coronation Street matriarch Hilda Ogden. Well, you can take a girl out of Burnley...

As for the many ruffled blouses that Bella wears on her adventures, carnal and otherwise, Waddington explains that their suggestive eroticism was quite deliberate. ""Lots of 1890s blouses have these pleats in the centre and these big folds felt like they looked like Georgia O'Keeffe paintings. We had many samples of these blouses, often with this motif on the front. They just had a sort of sensuousness, a sort of organic, curvaceous, feminine quality to them in their very nature. Yorgos would joke and say, 'It's another vagina blouse!' I wasn't trying to design a blouse like a giant vagina... I hope it's just subliminal.""

In seasons to come, I can perfectly imagine that the sensual adventuress Bella Baxter will be a muse pinned to many a designer's mood board; flexing her signature silhouette - those super-inflated mutton sleeves. ""For me they are about empowerment. So that's a great thing,"" says Waddington of the sleeves. ""If you look at other periods in the history of dress when women had big sleeves - the Elizabethan age, the 1940s, the 1980s, women have been in strong positions in society.""

Perfectly fitting for the headstrong Bella Baxter, whose journey of discovery - sexual and otherwise - is as potent as it is provocative.

2024-02-01,The 154 calorie meal in McDonalds - and five other healthy dishes at fast food chains,"When you're in a rush to eat, you probably opt for a familiar food chain. But are there any nutritious (and tasty) options out there?

You're rushing from one meeting or errand to the next when hanger - hunger-induced anger - strikes. The person you strive to be would have popped some fruit and nuts into their bag before leaving home, but the real you forgot. You need to eat now, but a greasy sausage roll from a convenience store isn't going to pass your lips. Are there any vaguely nutritious options on the high street?

""It's only one meal and you can hopefully make up for it later with something balanced and home-cooked,"" says Emily Kerrigan, a registered nutritionist. ""It's not always easy to find fresh, healthy options on the go but in general try to avoid foods that are high in saturated fat, sugar and salt, known as HFSS foods.""

But there are healthy options. Ideally, grab fresh fruit or veg, a pot of plain yoghurt, nuts, seeds or anything with wholegrains, lean protein and healthy fats. ""But even if you're only managing to tick one or two of those boxes, that's OK,"" Kerrigan says. And opt for water rather than a sugary drink or caramel-and-cream topped beverage. ""You're just drinking surplus empty calories,"" she says.

So, what are the most nutritious options from leading food-on-the-move brands that taste good and keep you fuller for longer?

McDonald's

Surely Golden Arches isn't the spot for a healthy bite on the move? Not if you order burgers, fries and sugar-laden condiments. ""But the grilled chicken salad meal is better for you than any burger,"" Kerrigan says. ""It comes with water and a bag of carrots to munch on, and in terms of calories, saturated fat and salt, beats burgers hands down."" For breakfast, go for plain porridge, without added sugar, jam or golden syrup.

Satiety: I wasn't hungry for a few hours. (4.5/5)

Total score: 3.75/5

Leon

Promoting itself as the healthy alternative to fast food chains, Leon has lots of good stuff to choose from. Kerrigan praises the rice boxes for sporting brown rather than nutrient-poor white rice. She also gives points for baked rather than fat-laden waffle fries - but recommends avoiding them. ""Opt for slaw, or at least add in the slaw if you're also having fries,"" she says.

Breakfast

Turmeric honey, banana & bee pollen yoghurt pot

Calories: 188

Nutrition: Gut-friendly live yoghurt; anti-inflammatory turmeric.

Taste: Deliciously creamy, the turmeric and bee pollen adds bags of flavour, but it was a bit sweet for me. (4/5)

Taste: Great flavour and heat in the spicy beans but it's a heavy, stodgy meal. (3.5/5)

Satiety: Extremely. (5/5)

Pret A Manger

Pret boasts that it serves high quality ingredients, delicious food, and lots of healthy choices. Kerrigan suggests swerving the pastries and opting for loose fruit for breakfast (less than half the price of a fruit pot with the same nutritional benefits). Reach for wraps, brown baguettes or wholegrain sandwiches with lean protein and lots of veggies for lunch. Or go for a protein bowl (like chicken and avocado), which is low in salt, saturated fat, and sugar.

Breakfast

A loose apple and banana

Calories: 140

Taste: The excellent mix of fresh and crunchy veg was completely overpowered by vinegar-laden ketchup. Could barely eat half. (2/5)

Satiety: Reasonably filling had I been able to eat the whole thing. (2/5)

Total score: 2/5

Joe & the Juice

This Danish chain serves healthy, Instagenic smoothies, juices, sandwiches and salads, but be careful. ""The acai breakfast bowl might be prettier, but the Eggcado breakfast sandwich is actually a bit lower in saturated fat, although both make great on-the-go breakfasts, "" says Kerrigan. She also notes that not all the raw cakes are as healthy as they might seem, as some contain more saturated fat than the blueberry muffins.

Nutrition: Ticks plenty of boxes with healthy greens, good fats and gut-loving pickles.

Taste: Difficult to chew through such an abundance of raw, fibrous veg (including giant chunks of broccoli stalk) with insufficient dressing or pesto. (2.5/5)

Satiety: Difficult to eat it all, so not hugely satisfying. (2.5/5)

Total score: 2.5/5

Costa

Healthy savoury options are limited here. In theory, Costa stocks the Bosh! plant-based range, but non-sweet products were unavailable at the numerous branches I tried. If you find one, go for the Bosh! ham and 'cheeze' toastie (lower in saturated fat than Costa's own version) for breakfast, or fill up on plain porridge.

Breakfast

Wholegrain porridge with semi-skimmed milk

Calories: 162

Nutrition: Low in saturated fat, sugar and salt.

Taste: Hot, creamy and flavoursome. (4/5)

Satiety: A small pot, so I was hungry again in an hour. (3/5)

Lunch

Prawn and mayo sandwich on oatmeal bread

Calories: 301

Nutrition: Low in saturated fat.

Taste: The bread was soft and fresh, the prawns sweet, but bland overall. (3/5)

Satiety: Light and insubstantial - I immediately needed more to eat. (2.5/5)

Total score: 2.75/5

Greggs

If you can, look past the bacon rolls and pastries and go for plain porridge for breakfast, Kerrigan advises. For lunch, chicken and vegetable soup is an option; although salty, it's considerably lower in saturated fat than the steak bake that might tempt you. ""But Gregg's sweet potato bhaji and rice box packs in way more nutritious bang for its buck than most of the menu, with added chickpeas, lentils, quinoa, spinach and peppers,"" she says.

Breakfast

Simply Creamy Porridge

Calories: 210

Nutrition: Low in saturated fat, sugar and salt.

Taste: The oats were virtually raw and served tepid. (0/5)

Statiety: Inedible, so not satisfying. (0/5)

Lunch

Sweet potato bhaji and rice

Calories: 244

Nutrition: Low in saturated fat, sugar and salt.

Taste: Chana masala sauce is flavourful but the rest is bland. (3/5)

Satiety: Mixed vegetables, chickpeas, lentils and quinoa make this a reasonably filling lunch. (3.5/5)

Total score: 3.25/5

Subway

The 'create your own' option means you can add whatever you want to your sandwich. ""It's basically an invitation to add in lots of extras, and not necessarily in a good way,"" says Kerrigan. But you can choose your fillings wisely. ""Start by not supersizing your sarnie and opt for wholegrain seeded bread over white wraps or baps or stick to a salad,"" she suggests. Include tuna or lean protein like turkey, and lots of salad ingredients. ""Don't get drawn into HFSS sides like hash browns.""

Breakfast

Egg and cheese sub on wholemeal bread (ask to swap the cheese for salad)

Calories: 294

Nutrition: Low in salt; there's more fibre and nutrients if you can add salad.

Taste: The egg is rubbery, but with salad makes an acceptable sandwich. (2.5/5)

Satiety: It filled me up until lunchtime. (4/5)

Total score: 3.25/5

Lunch

Create your own six-inch sub with wholegrain bread, turkey breast, salad and pesto

Calories: 282

Nutrition: Low in saturated fat and a source of fibre and nutrients from fresh salad.

Taste: Bread and turkey lack flavour, but the salad and pesto are tasty enough (3.5/5)

Satiety: It filled me up until lunchtime. (4/5)

Total score: 3.75/5

Petrol station

It's grim trying to find something nutritious and filling at a petrol station (unless you're lucky enough to be passing through Gloucester Services.) ""Try to refuel on something like a takeaway soup or a tub of hummus with some oatcakes, "" Kerrigan advises. ""If that fails, look for a pot of plain, unsweetened yoghurt, an apple or banana, or packs of plain (unsalted and unroasted) nuts or seeds."" Unsweetened popcorn is lower in fat than crisps, and a few squares of dark chocolate will satisfy a sweet craving. Sadly, the petrol station I visited had few of these options.

Breakfast

A pot of roasted nuts and a pot of falafel and hummus dip

Calories: 418 calories

Taste: The nuts were stale and the falafel rock hard and inedible. (1/5)

Satiety: The nuts and hummus filled me up for an hour or so. (2/5)

Total: 1.5/5

Lunch

John West Tuna Bean Salad

Calories: 252

Nutrients: Contains one of my five-a-day.

Taste: Claggy and unpleasant. (1.5/5)

Satiety: Briefly filled a gap. (1/5)

2024-02-01,Why early February is the perfect moment to book a holiday,"With a strong pound, the final days of January sales and a bank account bolstered by the payday, there is no better time to plan a trip

January may be over, but this doesn't mean you've missed your opportunity to find a brilliant holiday at a good price. In fact, now is a fine moment to book your next getaway.

While most sales ended on January 31, some deals are still live. EasyJet's Big Orange Sale ends on Monday February 5, while Love Holidays' 25 per cent hotel discount ends at midnight on Sunday February 4 and Flight Centre's January sale extends to February 14.

In further good news for British holidaymakers browsing for a getaway, the pound is predicted to hit a two-year high this week, with Goldman Sachs forecasting sterling to hit $1.30 and 84p per euro in the coming months.

If you're keen to get away soon, it's not too late to book something around Valentine's Day or for the forthcoming half term (February 10-18, at most schools). It is up to you whether you look north, where the northern lights are reaching their solar maximum, or south, where parts of Europe are basking in an unseasonal heatwave (the mercury hit 29C near Valencia last week). If booking flights and hotels independently, take a look at Ryanair's offering: they recently announced they would be slashing fares on off-season flights.

Looking further ahead, the two-week Easter school holiday (March 29-April 14, at most schools) brings opportunities for a longer family getaway - potentially long haul - while the early May bank holiday is a great time for child-free couples (or empty nesters) to maximise on annual leave without being bothered by young ones at the hotel.

Need no further convincing to dip into this month's payday funds? Here are seven options to get you started.

Chase the sun in Lanzarote

It's not exactly Antigua, but the temperature in Lanzarote will range from around 17C to 21C in mid-February. That is about as close as you'll get to guaranteed European sun in late winter. Original Travel has a Wild and Lunar holiday targeted at families, taking in lava fields, a national park, unspoilt beaches and two properties that are well-suited for families - plus a private tour. Seven nights cost from £1,565pp based on a family of four, including accommodation, activities, car hire and return flights (020 3582 4990; originaltravel.co.uk).

February fun in Finland

A new itinerary from Families Worldwide packages together classic Arctic Circle experiences with skiing at a family snow school. The high-energy itinerary, based at Ruka in northern Finland, includes snow-tubing, husky sledding and skiing or snowboarding, plus ice-karting and tobogganing. There will also be the opportunity to witness the northern lights, which have been particularly active this season. Seven nights start from £1,695 for adults and £1,395 per child and include accommodation, transfers, activities and return flights (01962 302062; familiesworldwide.co.uk). Departures February 10 and 17.

Romance in Rome

It doesn't get much more romantic than a city break in Rome for Valentine's Day, does it? Inspiring Travel has a package staying at the five-star, 18th-century palazzo Hotel de la Ville (run by Rocco Forte, no less) overlooking the Spanish Steps. It's a wonderful, crisp time of the year to explore the city without hordes of crowds and away from the humid heat of the summer. Three nights cost from £1,259 in a superior room, including breakfast, €100 (£85) resort credit, transfers and return flights (01244 729748; inspiringtravel.co.uk).

Your own private island for Easter

Typically seen as a haven for honeymooners, the Maldives has a growing tranche of hotels catering for families. Enter Conrad Maldives Rangali Island, set on its own private island with all the powder-soft sand beaches you would hope for. The resort has a new Furaavaru Club for teenagers (think banana boats) plus art and craft activities for younger ones, while snorkelling excursions offer a glimpse of turtles, manta rays and whale sharks. Best at Travel offers a seven-night holiday for a family of four from £12,583, including half-board accommodation, return flights with Qatar Airways and seaplane tickets (0203 993 5300; bestattravel.co.uk). Departs April 1.

A Spanish escape for May Bank Holiday

This year the garden city of S'Agaro, on Spain's Costa Brava, celebrates its 100th anniversary, making it a fine time to visit with soirees taking place throughout the year. Kirker Holidays has a special offer for four nights at the grand palace hotel, Hostal de La Gavina, from £992pp. Lady Gaga, Elizabeth Taylor and Frank Sinatra are among its previous guests, while Michelin-starred chef Romain Fornell is at the helm of its three restaurants.

A solo retreat in Saint Lucia

Where better to pamper yourself than at a resort on a secluded beach in Saint Lucia? If you can get over the potentially unnerving mantra of ""give us your body for a week, and we'll give you back your mind"", the BodyHoliday resort provides a luxurious wellness experience including a daily 50-minute spa treatment, specialised fitness classes and garden rooms designed specifically for solo travellers. Scott Dunn offers seven nights at the BodyHoliday resort from £3,000pp, including return flights from the UK, selected activities and private transfers (020 3813 7587; scottdunn.com).

A lavish group getaway... in Norfolk

Norfolk View House, with access to the beach in the coastal village of Mundesley, sleeps between 16 and 22 guests. Nearby there is an adventure park with quad biking and assault courses for thrill-seeking teens, and there's a local surf school for those willing to brave the North Sea. The price tag is £6,500 self-catering for a week, but when split between 22 people, £295 a head doesn't sound quite so intimidating for a full week away (01242 220006; thewowhousecompany.com).","While most sales ended on January 31, some deals are still live.

2024-02-01,"Migration, review: this handsome tale of two ducklings perfectly fits the half-term bill","A pair of adventurous young fowl challenge their overprotective father in an animation that's formulaic but looks, sounds and tastes a treat

Released in plenty of time for half-term, Migration bounces in with a score by John Powell that's so fresh and bright, it's like daffodils flowering in quick time. It might have been full of the joys of spring, if it weren't for the pesky premise - a family of mallards risk flying south, for the first time, from the corner of New England they call home.

Lush fall foliage surrounds them in the kind of pond Henry David Thoreau found inspiring. But they can't stay there for ever, for all the protestations of an overprotective papa duck that they have more to lose by shifting base than they ever will to gain.

The studio is Illumination, best-known for the Despicable Me films and their Minions spin-offs, which lean heavily into goofy snark. (A Minions short called Mooned precedes this, which caused half the critics in the room to panic they'd shown up for the wrong screening.) French director Benjamin Renner takes us on a gently formulaic ride, calling to mind the Ice Age franchise and especially Rio (2011), by the (now sadly shuttered) rival outfit Blue Sky Studios.

You will have seen some kissing cousin of this story before: the two youngsters (voiced by Caspar Jennings and Tresi Gazal) crave adventure, they're humoured by their ma (Elizabeth Banks), but curbed in every waddling step by Mack (Kumail Nanjiani), their eternally worried patriarch. The lesson of the film is simply that Mack, like many a parent, needs to chill out. Ducks migrate! It's what they do. Even Uncle Dan (Danny DeVito), who's chubby and hates change, has a drumstick twisted to give it a go.

The final destination is Jamaica, but the layovers are several. When clouds part and they're blown into the polluted midst of New York City, the overfamiliarity of the setting is redeemed by the film's well-above-par visual imagination.","Migration bounces in with a score by John Powell that's so fresh and bright, it's like daffodils flowering in quick time.

2024-02-01,"'The best parenting in the world' cannot keep children safe from social media, say Harry and Meghan","The Sussexes told tech bosses they need to make changes to keep young people safe, rather than passing 'the buck of responsibility'

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have warned that ""the best parenting in the world"" cannot keep children safe from social media.

The couple told technology companies including Meta, TikTok, and X (formerly Twitter) that it was time to make the changes needed to keep young people safe online, rather than passing ""the buck of responsibility"".

Prince Harry and Meghan issued a statement after the chief executives of several social media giants gave evidence before the US Senate Judiciary Committee, in front of parents whose children suffered or died because of online harm.

The Sussexes have been outspoken critics of the way such firms handle child safety and have been working for many months with families who lost children due to social media pressures.

'Transcends division and party lines'

In a statement on their Archewell website, the couple said: ""We applaud the bravery and determination of the thousands of parents around the country whose advocacy resulted in this hearing.

""Over the past few years we have spent time with many of these families, listening to their heartache and their hopes for the urgent change that is needed in the online space.

""This is an issue that transcends division and party lines, as we saw today at the Senate hearing. The best parenting in the world cannot keep children safe from these platforms.""

They added: ""As one of the fathers shared with us: 'If love could have saved them, all of our children would still be here'.

""This is not the time to pass the buck of responsibility. It's the time to make necessary change at the source to keep our children safe.""

'You have blood on your hands'

During the congressional hearing on Wednesday, Republican senator Lindsey Graham told Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg and others: ""I know you don't mean it to be so, but you have blood on your hands. You have a product that's killing people.""

Mr Zuckerberg stood up at one point to address dozens of parents in the audience, some of whom held up pictures of teenagers who killed themselves following abuse on social media.

He told them: ""I'm sorry for everything you have all been through.""

The Sussexes' statement was accompanied by a video of the couple at the Archewell Foundation Parents' Summit in October last year, which focused on mental wellness in a digital age to mark World Mental Health Day.

They were seen hugging parents who shared their harrowing experiences.

Speaking at the event, the Duke said they began working with the families who had ""suffered the greatest loss"" when they realised how many were in their position and that no one was bringing them together.

'Focus on a solution'

Many are part of a group from the Social Media Victims Law Centre, a US-based legal practice working to hold social media companies to account for harm.

The Duke said the focus was on allowing them to ""heal together, to grieve together but also to focus on a solution, so that no other family anywhere has to go through what they've been through.""

""There's nothing wrong with these kids.... It's the world that we're allowing to create around them,"" he said.

Prince Harry called for more transparency and more awareness. He said that if the shareholders of tech companies could accept they might make ""a little less profit"" to guarantee a safer space, they could stop the suffering.

""Once you go down that rabbit hole you get pulled in,"" he said.

""Otherwise, before you know it, your very healthy, super happy, confident, successful child, who has nothing wrong with them, is taking their own life.""

Meanwhile, Meghan said that although their own children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, were only four and two, social media was ""not going away"".","The Sussexes have warned that ""the best parenting in the world"" cannot keep children safe from social media.

2024-02-01,American Fiction: an ingenious takedown of tokenism and racial stereotyping,"Representation: it's a complex word. Sometimes it refers to a depiction of someone; sometimes to the stand-in who appears on the represented party's behalf. It can also be a formal plea or complaint - as film has recently discovered, representations might be made when representation isn't thought up to snuff.

This sparkling literary caper, in the running for five Oscars including Best Picture, unfolds at the hairy convergence of all of the above. A tremendous Jeffrey Wright stars as Thelonious Ellison, who's known as 'Monk' to his friends - not that he has many of those. His days are spent tutoring overwhelmingly white and woke creative writing students, who bridle during a lecture on Flannery O'Connor when he writes the n-word on the board. (""With all due respect, Britney, I got over it, I'm don't see why you can't,"" he drily responds.)

Monk is himself a talented author, but his strain of erudite, classically inspired fiction is well behind the times. The only works by black writers that get picked up these days are gritty memoirs, crammed with gun crime, trauma, terrible fathers, and grammar-mangling argot. (The signing circuit's current flavour of the month is Issa Rae's Sintara Golden, whose bestseller We's Lives in Da Ghetto is a classic of the type.)

To expunge his frustrations, Monk knocks out an inane pastiche which he initially titles 'My Pafology', and submits pseudonymously to a number of publishers. To his horror - and his agent's delight, as talk of six-figure advances and film rights begin to swirl - he realises his own urban Springtime for Hitler is going to be a hit.

Director Cord Jefferson, a veteran writer on series like Succession and Watchmen, adapted American Fiction from the Percival Everett novel Erasure. That was published back in 2001, but events in the intervening years, as this once elite concern has exploded across culture more broadly, have only sharpened its premise's bite.","A tremendous Jeffrey Wright stars as Thelonious Ellison, who's known as 'Monk' to his friends.

2024-02-01,Zimingzhong: Clockwork Treasures from China's Forbidden City: a spellbinding extravaganza of ostentation,"These elaborate mechanical treasures may not chime with contemporary taste, but they are wondrous and otherworldly

Is that Big Ben? An elaborate mechanical clock with a tall spire and four-faced base appears at the start of this spellbinding exhibition at the Science Museum. It looks like a model of Parliament's clock tower - and was manufactured in London, like the Great Bell.

Except it dates from the 18th century, and represents a nine-tiered Chinese pagoda. When this gizmo was wound, its tapering structure would jerkily rise and fall, like a rickety, ailing rocket, struggling to take off.

It's a fine example of what China's emperors, who collected hundreds of them, called ""zimingzhong"" (pronounced zi-ming-jong), or ""bells that ring themselves"". Twenty-three zimingzhong, lent by Beijing's Palace Museum (formerly, the Forbidden City), and never seen in Britain, are now on display in South Kensington, illuminating an important moment in our relations with the Middle Kingdom.

During the 18th century, British merchants hungry for Chinese silk, porcelain, and tea hit upon the idea of marketing this country's clockmakers in return. Inventive horologists such as James Cox, who'd trained as a goldsmith, had the know-how to craft luxury timepieces with complex mechanisms capable of powering many chiming, moving parts. Some of these ingenious clocks could even play melodies - hence, their old-fashioned British name: ""sing-songs"".

China's emperors loved these ""foreign curiosities"" and began demanding them as tribute; a painting reproduced in the exhibition depicts a procession bearing gifts, including zimingzhong, arriving at the Forbidden City.","China's emperors, who collected hundreds of them, called them ""zimingzhong"" (pronounced zi-ming-jong) 23 of these ""foreign curiosities"" are now on display at the Science Museum in South Kensington.","[('museum', 0.4352), ('zimingzhong', 0.3961), ('curiosities', 0.3681), ('china', 0.349), ('ming', 0.3041), ('emperors', 0.2755), ('foreign', 0.2615), ('science', 0.2089), ('kensington', 0.204), ('jong', 0.2007)]","museum, zimingzhong, curiosities, china, ming, emperors, foreign, science, kensington, jong",95
2024-02-01,"Billy Joel, Turn the Lights Back On: an old-fashioned love song from a man who's still got it","Billy Joel's first new song in 17 years is a heartfelt, classic ballad that proves the great singer songwriter has lost none of his class

""Did I wait too long?"" Billy Joel pleads on a new single, Turn the Lights Back On. Well, the great singer-songwriter has left it over 30 years to get back to what he does best in a recording studio, but I suspect fans will forgive him if the rest of a rumoured forthcoming comeback album is as lovely as this.

Released today, in time for an appearance at the Grammy Awards this weekend, Turn the Lights Back On is an understated, bittersweet ballad about forgiveness, hope and rekindling a relationship too long taken for granted, ""trying to find the magic that we lost somehow."" It starts with no preamble, with Joel straight in pleading ""Please open the door,"" his piano ringing out stately chords. ""Nothing is different, we've been here before.""

That we have. Apart from the streaming friendly absence of an intro (it is the modern way to get straight to business before listeners can click on something else), this is a very old-fashioned ballad, with simple, heartfelt verses opening out to a lush chorus on an arrangement that focuses on Joel's elegant piano playing and steadfast, evocative voice. A sweet cello countermelody opens up into rich, sad strings, whilst a drummer holds a steady, sparse waltz beat that gradually builds in intensity. It is pretty much what classic ballads have sounded like since the early 1970s, evoking The Beatles' Let It Be and Elton John's Your Song.

You can get away with that when you are a class act, which Billy Joel certainly is. The chords are unsurprising, the lifts and drops come exactly where you think they might, but you find yourself rapt as he makes his case for reconnection. ""I'm late, but I'm here right now ..."" As befitting a man of 74, it is a grown-up love song, that admits to a lack of romance but still carries an emotional force that might crack any stony heart.

It is Joel's first single since the sentimental All My Life in 2007, which was written as an anniversary gift for his third wife Katie Lee, who divorced him two years later. So much for the power of song. Before that, you'd have to go back to 1993, when he made his last album of original songs, River of Dreams, which emerged from the break-up of his second marriage to supermodel Christie Brinkley. The artistic fight seemed to go out of Joel after that.","Billy Joel's first new song in 17 years is a classic ballad about forgiveness.

Austria is well-known for the high standards of its friendly, clean and usually family-run hotels and Obergurgl is no exception to the rule. Rather than traditional British-run chalet options, UK tour operators tend to offer good-value, half-board packages to a selection of these hotels -some well-located by the main access lifts, the Rosskar gondola or Hohe Mut Bahn gondola.

2024-02-01,An expert guide to ski holidays in Obergurgl,"The best places to stay, eat, drink and ski in Austria's snow-sure family favourite

Obergurgl is one of the highest ski villages in Europe, set at 1,930m at the end of the Ötztal valley near the city of Innsbruck. The height of its own slopes, plus a mid-mountain link to neighbouring Hochgurgl, which has slopes going up to 3,080m, make it exceptionally snow sure for Austria, with a winter season that lasts from mid-November until late April.

While the ski area is limited by modern standards, with 112km of piste and 25 lifts, Obergurgl is popular with the British and many families loyally return every winter to the small, traditional village set around an early 18th-century church. There is little traffic and the resort also attracts a wealthy international clientele.

Stay on track with the essential facts from the resort below, and scroll down for our insider guide to a day on the pistes, expert ratings and advice. For further Obergurgl inspiration, see our guides to the resort's best accommodation, restaurants and après ski.

Inside the resortOn the slopesWho should goEssential information

Inside the resort

It was not Obergurgl's snow record that first put the little resort on the map, but an aviation accident in the summer of 1931. A Swiss pilot called Auguste Piccard pushed his hot air balloon into the stratosphere to a record height of nearly 16,000m. He then crash landed on the remote Gurgler-Ferner glacier, not far from the village.

Eagle-eyed local mountain guide Hans Falkner spotted the landing in the twilight. The following morning he carried out a heroic rescue, leading the frazzled flyers across the crevasses to safety. The feat received immediate world recognition - and Obergurgl never looked back.

The ski area is ideal for beginners and improving intermediates. The more advanced will find more challenge at two resorts nearby: Vent, which is smaller, and larger Sölden. Both are covered by the Ötztal Super Skipass, the automatic option when buying an Obergurgl lift pass for three days or longer. It takes in all six ski areas in the Ötztal valley. Moreover the off-piste opportunities in and around Obergurgl are excellent, and in late spring it is a major destination for ski touring.

Many families loyally return every winter to the small, traditional village set around an early 18th-century church and the resort's original inn, the Hotel Edelweiss & Gurgl.

It's worth taking the two-way gondola over to explore Hochgurgl. One of the highlights includes the Top Mountain Crosspoint. As well as being the base station for a two-stage gondola to nearly 3,000m, the building houses a smart mountain restaurant (along with Europe's highest motorbike museum the ""Top Mountain Motorcycle Experience""), and a motorbike museum, reconstructed after a major fire in January 2021.

The après scene in Obergurgl is traditional rather than contemporary, with late afternoon dancing on tables in a couple of the mountain restaurants, including the Nederhütte.

On the slopes

While Obergurgl's ski area is small by modern standards, the overall experience of friendly villages and intermediate slopes that are equally snow sure in December and April make it popular with families. Lift passes of three days and longer are issued as the Ötztal Super Skipass, covering all the ski areas in the Ötztal valley, namely Obergurgl-Hochgurgl, Sölden, Hochoetz-Kühtai, Niederthai, Gries and Vent (a total of 356km of pistes). This pass adds appeal for more advanced visitors, particularly in Vent and Sölden, and all are connected by free ski bus.

The Obergurgl-Hochgurgl ski area has 112km of pistes - approximately 56km for each resort - split into three areas. The sector immediately above Obergurgl village is served by the Festkoglbahn gondola on the outskirts of town, and the 10-person Rosskar gondola from the village centre (the latter replacing the previous chairlift in 21/22, now taking nine minutes to reach Festkogl Alm at 2,668m). From here, just below the 3,038m summit of Festkogl, a drag-lift and a chairlift serve an assortment of blue and red runs, along with three blacks that could easily pass for reds. It's all good cruising fun.

From mid-mountain the impressive Top Express gondola whisks across two little valleys to the mid-mountain slopes of neighbouring, lesser-known Hochgurgl. There are much longer - but no more challenging - blues, reds, and occasional blacks here, and strong intermediates can get a proper workout. From the top of the Wurmkogl peak the run all the way down to the valley road is the best part of 1,200m.

The two-stage 10-person Kirchenkarbahn gondola here climbs to 2,839m, from where there's a long blue run all the way to the bottom, with a red variation. For the more expert, there are also steep off-piste freeriding routes from here, and others from Wurmkogl.

The third sector, reached by the two-stage Hohe Mut Bahn gondola from the centre of Obergurgl, ascends to the Hohe Mut at 2,670m for one of the best mountain restaurants in the area, and the start of some spectacular touring opportunities along the Italian frontier. The red runs from here are either medium or difficult, depending on the length of lunch, and this is also where Obergurgl's off piste shines, with marked off-piste itinerary routes, including from the restaurant, providing significant challenges. While there is a dedicated Freeride Map Obergurgl, available to buy from the tourist office, routes are undertaken at own risk and hiring a mountain guide is recommended.

While Obergurgl is not a huge destination for freestylers, the Familypark situated next to the Bruggenboden lift suits those who want to give tricks a try, while more advanced freestylers can head for a more advanced terrain park, close to the Steinmannbahn chairlift. There is also a free-to-use transceiver training area here.

There's a small selection of ski schools in Obergurgl and one in Hochgurgl. Most of the instructors speak good English.

Who should go?

Families come here for the overall experience of friendly villages and slopes that are equally snow‑sure from December to April. The slopes are best suited to beginners and intermediates looking for relaxed slopes, but for experts there are also excellent off-piste opportunities and in the late spring Obergurgl is a major destination for ski touring. Obergurgl's image as the country's most reliable resort for snow cover is not unfounded, its season starts in mid‑November and last over six months.

Local laws & etiquette

Formal greetings are the norm when meeting someone, and you'll hear 'Grüss Gott' (greeting the almighty), or the more worldly 'Guten Morgen/Tag/Abend', just about everywhere you go, and it's customary to return the salutation. Locals love their titles, so if you are meeting someone who has a university degree, not only are you expected to know this fact, but you're expected to use the title whilst shaking hands e.g 'Grüß Gott Herr Doktor' in cafés and restaurants the waiter will expect to hear a 'Herr Ober' (Mr. waiter) from guests seeking attention. Tips are not included, nor is it usual to leave them on the table. After the waiter has given you the bill add roughly 10 per cent and ask for it to be added to the total.A simple thank you is 'Danke'; 'Bitte' means both 'please' and 'you're welcome'.","Obergurgl is one of the highest ski villages in Europe, set at 1,930m at the end of the tztal valley near the city of Innsbruck.

2024-02-01,Till the Stars Come Down: a brilliantly observed slice of modern working-class life,"Beth Steel's excellent family drama at the National feels like a breath of fresh air amidst the current dearth of entertaining new writing

Although it's early days for theatre-going in 2024, there's a real feeling of ""at last!"" about Beth Steel's new play. At the National, playwrights haven't always been on-song of late. And more widely there has been a concerning dearth of entertaining new writing that also matters.

With Till The Stars Come Down, we get that rare thing, a family drama about the white working-class today, with ramifications for us all, taking in the impact of immigration, financial insecurity and uncertainty, plus love, death and the whole complex kaboodle of getting through life. It's often deliriously funny, but also has a stabbing sense of insoluble pain.

In the 10 years since Steel's Wonderland - inspired by her father, a former Nottinghamshire miner, and revisiting that nation-dividing strike of 1984 - her skillset has sharpened further, resulting in dialogue that has been crafted for maximum effect while sounding authentic and spontaneous.

Here she returns to her Midlands hometown of Mansfield, part of the Red Wall that crumbled at the last election. Initially, we're in the house of a widower (and ex-miner) called Tony, whose daughter Sylvia is in the process of getting married to an industrious local Pole called Marek, who arrived in the UK with £60 and has built his own business.

The summer air is filled with pre-nuptial stress, the sound of hair-dryers and backchat involving Sylvia's sisters Maggie and Hazel, the latter's two young daughters and 'Aunty Carol', whose unfiltered interjections are as priceless as they are tawdry (""Now there's a man I wouldn't kick out of bed for farting,"" runs her greeting to her host).","Beth Steel's excellent family drama at the National feels like a breath of fresh air.

2024-02-01,The cheapest electric cars on sale today,"With EV prices showing no signs of dropping, if you want to make the switch cheaply these are the cars to buy now

If there's one thing we all know about electric cars, it's that they're not cheap to buy. So, of course, the one thing everyone asks about electric cars - apart from how far they can go on a charge - is how much they cost. And more specifically, which ones are the most affordable.

Here is the answer to that question: our guide to the most affordable electric cars on the market today. These things are all relative, mind you; with the exception of the Citroën Ami, which barely qualifies as a car, the starting price for entry to the EV club is £23,000-odd. But if it's a cheap electric car - as these things go - that you're after, then you'll find it here.

10. Ora Funky Cat

There's certainly no mistaking the Funky Cat, soon to be named the Ora 03. It's the first car to arrive in Britain from Chinese brand Ora, and its extrovert styling, a pastiche of classic and futuristic styling cues, is intended to appeal to fashionistas everywhere. Inside it's just as eye-catching, with an interior dominated by bold shapes and bright colours. Think Fiat 500 with more space. But - and it's a big but - the 500 is a more convincing proposition all round than the Funky Cat, whose harsh ride, sloppy handling and poor build quality suggest you get what you pay for.

Price: from £31,995.

Buy it for: Extrovert looks.

Avoid it for: Everything else.

9. Mazda MX-30

Always thinking outside the box, Mazda has given its first electric car, the MX-30, a single rear-hinged ""suicide"" back door, which seems like an interesting idea on paper. Trouble is, in practice it doesn't work very well. In fact, the same can be said of the rest of the car; Mazda hoped buyers would live with its short range as a payoff for a small battery, hence low weight and zingy handling. However, that hasn't proven to be the case and now, next to cars such as the MG 4, the MX-30 simply looks like a lot of money for what it is.

Price: from £31,250.

Buy it for: Taut handling.

Avoid it for: Miniscule range.

8. Renault Zoe

It might come as a bit of a surprise to find out Renault still makes the Zoe - after all, it's been around in the same basic form for 12 years, although updates have kept its range and charging speeds reasonably current. While it may be a familiar sight, though, its styling hasn't really dated, while it hasn't been surpassed by rivals in terms of its space or driving experience, so there's life in the old dog yet - especially at prices which undercut its most direct competitors.

Price: from £31,195.

Buy it for: Value, tried and tested technology.

Avoid it for: Slow charging speeds as standard, so-so range.

7. MG 5 EV

If you need an electric car that's also an estate, then look no further: the MG 5 is the answer to your prayers. Yes, it's rather plain to look at, and the quality of the interior could be better, but there's no arguing with the value it offers. Roomy, well-equipped, and surprisingly engaging to drive, the 5 is a great all-rounder, and now that MG's given it proper lumbar support on its recent facelift, it's even had its biggest failing - its uncomfortable seats - fixed.

Price: from £30,995.

Buy it for: Space, value, long warranty.

Avoid it for: Uninspiring looks.

6. MG ZS EV

The first EV that MG brought to the UK proved extremely popular. Is it any wonder, given what value it offered? Next to its rivals - not to mention the electric models MG has brought in since, which offer more range for even less money - it now looks a little less impressive in pure value terms. But it's still worth considering if you're after a relatively compact car that packs in lots of equipment.

Price: from £30,495.

Buy it for: Generous equipment, decent space, good to drive.

Avoid it for: Relatively short range.

5. Nissan Leaf

The first-generation Leaf was a pioneer, but this second-generation version has felt like a bit of an also-ran since it arrived

in 2017. Now, though, with rivals' prices having soared and a new, cheaper entry-level model to try to fend off the challenge from Chinese rivals, the Leaf looks like decent value. Keep in mind, however, that the entry-level car's battery is rather small by modern standards, so it won't go all that far on a charge - and upgrading to the larger battery adds a fair whack to the price.

Price: from £28,495.

Buy it for: Low price.

Avoid it for: Short range on entry-level versions.

4. Fiat 500

For the fashion-conscious EV buyer, there can surely be no more desirable option than the Fiat 500e. Packed with all the character and fashion-conscious personalisation options of the petrol-powered 500, it's an EV that doesn't stint on fun. It also manages to feel pretty swish from within, which goes some way toward justifying its price. Having said that, keep in mind that the rear seats are pretty cramped, making them distinctly child-only places.

Price: from £28,195.

Buy it for: Fashionable status, cheeky looks.

Avoid it for: Cramped rear seats.

3. MG 4 EV

A slew of awards have greeted the MG 4, largely for bringing family-sized electric motoring to a price that most buyers can conceivably afford. That it does this while also packing in strong equipment levels and looking a little different to the norm only add to its appeal. It's even quite good fun to drive. Granted, the interior isn't as high-quality as you'd like, and the touchscreen is rather glitchy. But for this price, you can forgive a lot.

Price: from £26,995.

Buy it for: Sensational value.

Avoid it for: Cheap-feeling interior.

2. BYD Dolphin

If you discount the Ami - and you may, given it's technically not a car, but a quadricycle in the eyes of the law - the BYD Dolphin is now the cheapest EV on sale on the UK. Trouble is, to benefit from that low price, you'll have to go for the Active version with a small battery and a relatively unsophisticated suspension set-up. We've yet to drive this model, but we do know the pricier Comfort feels rather rough around the edges - perhaps, then, you get what you pay for. We'll let you know when we find out.

Price: from £26,195.

Buy it for: A low, low price.

Avoid it for: Lack of finesse.

1. Citroën Ami

Ah, the Ami. Naturally, the most affordable electric car - if you can call it that - your money will buy you. And for bimbling around town on electric power, it makes a good amount of sense. In theory, at least. In practice, it's fine as long as you don't encounter any hills. If it were just a little more powerful, it'd be brilliant. As it is, it's still worth considering - but only if you live somewhere flat.

Price: from £8,095.

Buy it for: Urban cruising...

Avoid it for: ...unless there are hills.

Will you take the plunge on an electric car? Let us know in the comments","With EV prices showing no signs of dropping, these are the cars to buy now.

2024-02-01,The five key buys which will make you look stylish now,"The items most worth splashing on are those with the capacity to inject a little pep; think classics with a modern twist

A perk of the job, as a fashion editor, is the chance to check out all the new-season collections before they land in store. It's a reminder, like the first green shoots on the trees, that warm weather is coming, even though it may not feel like it yet.

These previews also provide an indication of what we'll want to wear in the coming months. Not trends, exactly - the modern, planet-conscious consumer doesn't replace their wardrobe at the start of each season - but we can't help but be drawn to the newness that fills the high street at this time of year. The hard part is working out if a garment is something we want to wear for the next few months or the next few years.

So here's my advice: the things worth your money are, on the face of it, classics, but with a twist that makes them feel modern. They're not going to date next season, or the season after that, but they do have the capacity to inject a little pep into your wardrobe - without identifying you as a slave to fashion trends.

Choose well, and that one purchase is all you'll need to make the rest of your clothes feel au courant, of the moment, contemporary... Just don't call it ""on trend"".

The pale blue suit

""Blue is the new pink"" the designers at John Lewis told me when I went to see its new spring/summer collection. The hero buy is this slouchy sky blue suit, which has just landed in-store, and will be perfect for both work and summer-season events. The jacket would also team well with pale blue denim for a suit-like look with a more off-duty feel.

Pale blue wool-blend blazer, £125, and trousers, £85, both John Lewis

The pleated wrap skirt

This shape takes inspiration from a kilt, but is more minimalist. It works at a mini, knee-length or midi length, so take your pick according to what suits your body shape and existing wardrobe best. Style it with a slim-fitting or boxy top (knit, T-shirt or shirt will all work well) and knee-high boots for an easy outfit formula that will carry you through into spring.

Raey belted wool wrap skirt, £325, Matches matchesfashion.com

The croissant crossbody

The croissant-shaped crossbody may look like a 1980s bumbag, but it's much, much more chic, and practical too. For a start, it's designed to be worn across the body, but not in a way that slices your chest in two. Instead, it nestles comfortably under the arm in a way that's well-positioned for rummaging for a wallet or keys.

Uniqlo's £14.90 nylon iteration is probably the most famous - it has a zip, adjustable strap and capacity for a phone, water bottle and book - and The Row's ""Banana"" bag, at £1,910, is the most expensive. Enter Cos, which has one of the best croissants out there, in leather, in a range of colours. No wonder it keeps selling out.

Swing crossbody, £110, Cos cos.com

The knitted co-ord

Yes, the knitted dress is chic, but the knitted co-ord is even more so, and it comes with a few advantages too: one is that you can buy different sizes for your top and bottom halves; another is that you can wear the two pieces both separately or as a set. The best benefit, though? Anyone who has worn a wool dress in an overheated room will know that taking off your jumper is far more socially acceptable than taking off your dress. This cotton-silk knit set will feel less sweaty than wool as the weather warms.

The luxe loafer

Fashion's love affair with the loafer shows no sign of letting up, so you can buy a pair confident in the knowledge that you'll get lots of wear out of them. There's the classic penny loafer, chunky lug sole varieties, horse-bit buckle versions, or this cherry-adorned pair by Duke+Dexter. Team them with contrasting socks and ankle-length trousers to put them centre stage.

Ferrari's new 2025 partnership...

11:00AM

Hamilton could make stunning Ferrari switch

Lewis Hamilton is expected to make a shock move from Mercedes to Formula One rivals Ferrari for the 2025 season.

Telegraph Sport understands Mercedes have put out an internal announcement with everyone called to a team briefing at 14:00 with team principal Toto Wolff and technical director James Allison. All team members are encouraged to attend.

Several reports claim talks between the seven-time world champion have been held with the Italian team with a view of signing a deal ahead of next year.

Hamilton has just signed a new two-year deal with Mercedes but there are claims the second year was optional. Ferrari want the British driver to join Charles Leclerc with Carlos Sainz only contracted until the end of this upcoming season.

The 39-year-old has not won a race for two seasons since being denied a record eighth title in 2021 in controversial circumstances by Max Verstappen in the final race of the season. He finished third in last year's drivers' championship after achieving six podium finishes.

Reacting to the reports, Sky F1's Karun Chandhok said: ""Biggest driver move shock since..... Lewis left Mclaren for Mercedes! Thought that Lewis would end his career at Merc but a chance to have a blast in the red car may have lured him in.""

When contacted by Telegraph Sport, Mercedes declined to comment.",Lewis Hamilton is expected to make a shock switch to Ferrari for the 2025 season.

2024-02-01,Convicted South African paedophile found working at Butlin's,"Dean Carelse was cleared to work as a lifeguard at the holiday resort in Minehead despite a string of convictions

A convicted paedophile deported from Australia has been working as a lifeguard at Butlin's in Minehead, Somerset, for nearly a year, an investigation has found.

Dean Carelse, 43, is a disgraced water polo coach and teacher who in 2022 was convicted of more than a dozen charges relating to indecent acts against children in Queensland.

The South African national is also under investigation in his home country where police believe he is linked to an alleged paedophile ring that operated in private schools, investigators told the Australian Broadcasting Commission on Thursday.

Despite his record of convictions - and the publicity around the case, which was covered in online media accessible in the UK - Carelse was cleared to work for the Butlin's resort.

For 10 months he has worked as a lifeguard at the holiday park which advertises itself as having pools suitable for ""all-action family fun"" where children over the age of eight do not need parental supervision.

It is understood Carelse had presented documents that showed he had passed a disclosure and barring service (DBS) criminal check.

The document had been co-signed by an international recruiter and listed ""none recorded"" under ""children's barred list information"", according to the ABC.

Carelse was sacked this week after the resort was contacted by an Australian journalist.

The Telegraph has contacted Butlin's for comment.

Carelse was previously a sports coach who mentored rugby players in South Africa before working for Water Polo Queensland and elite schools in Australia.

His career ended when he was caught taking pictures of children in their swimming trunks while he was poolside at their school sports carnival.

In what prosecutors called a ""slippery slope"" of offending, the teacher had gone on to groom a 13-year-old boy for sex and message other minors on social media under an alias.

Police later uncovered 2,000 exploitative images during a raid on Carelse's home north of Brisbane, as well as indecent recordings of students at a swimming pool.

Ben Powers, part of Carelse's defence counsel, told a court in 2022 that his client knew that child abuse material was ""shameful"" but that he had been lonely and developed ""an unhealthy and improper adoration"" for the 13-year-old whom he made the benefactor of his will and retirement fund.

Carelse was sentenced to jail in 2022 then deported to South Africa. Police there were awaiting further information from their Australian counterparts before proceeding with their investigation, the ABC reported.

The broadcaster confirmed Queensland police uncovered evidence suggesting some of the Carelse's victims were South African children.

South African police then requested more information about local victims but was informed that information sharing would require an international treaty, a police source told the ABC.

The delay in the sharing of evidence between the countries meant Carelse was able to travel.

'No issues of complaints'

A Queensland Police spokesman said the force had done ""due diligence"".

""As the material is child exploitation, it is not something that can just be sent. The QPS have no authority to send it without application in the form of an MLAT (Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty) from South African Police. This has not occurred,"" he told the ABC.

A Butlin's spokesman told ABC the company had investigated immediately and that Carelse ""no longer worked for us with immediate effect"".

""The team member falsified information on their application,'' the spokesman said, before adding that the company would review its policy checking new staff members.""

The spokesman said there had been ""no issues of complaints raised"" against Carelse in his time as a lifeguard.

On its online job portal, Butlin's requires applicants for their lifeguard positions to declare whether they have ""any unspent criminal convictions"" or ""ongoing criminal proceedings that we should be aware of"".

The application forms state: ""Due to the nature of some of our roles at Butlin's, you may be required to undergo a DBS check as part of your employment. This will also apply should you live in our resorts.""

Butlin's recruits people who have a ""natural ability to engage and relate with a wide range of people"" and who consider themselves a ""strong swimmer"".

""Our guests' safety is our biggest priority so this role requires superb attention to detail whilst also interacting with our guests and providing exceptional customer service,"" one Butlins advertisement reads. ""You will promote and run poolside activities, creating memorable experiences for our guests.""","Dean Carelse cleared to work as a lifeguard at Butlin's in Minehead, Somerset.

2024-02-01,Lizzie Hanlon interview: From diver to Women's Six Nations bolter,"John Mitchell's call to the Exeter Chiefs tighthead caught her off-guard and she could become rugby's latest successful 'talent crossover'

When Lizzie Hanlon quit her promising diving career as a teenager, she never expected life as an international rugby player would beckon. Her performances for Exeter Chiefs in the women's top flight this season, however, have created quite a splash.

The tighthead's inclusion in John Mitchell's Women's Six Nations training camp last week points to an England head coach eager to stamp his mark on his new squad. It caught Hanlon, a graduate of Exeter's trusted university system who has become a focal point of Chiefs' marauding front row, completely off-guard.

The 22-year-old was enjoying a lie-in when her phone buzzed with an unknown number less than 48 hours after Exeter's Premiership Women's Rugby defeat by Saracens a fortnight ago. ""I got up after that, there was no more napping,"" laughs Hanlon of Mitchell's call.

Sarah Bern's season-ending knee injury may have aided her selection, but as one of a number of rugby talent transfers who are thriving in the women's top flight, her call-up was warranted.

Not so long ago Hanlon was a promising diver, breaking into the top 20 in the country for her national age group after being introduced to the sport aged 13. ""I never had rugby on my radar,"" she tells Telegraph Sport. ""It was my brother who was good at rugby - my dad used to play it at university - but I was always the gymnast and the diver.

""I had my GCSEs coming up. It was a huge commitment in terms of time and money, and we made the decision that I didn't want to pursue a career in diving. Looking back, it was a bit sad, there was an element of falling out of love with it.""

Little did Hanlon know that those years of heavy conditioning would prime her for an unexpected venture into rugby. After calling time on her diving career, she missed the thrill of elite sport and after a rugby taster session at her school she began playing for Surrey and Epsom RFC. She enjoyed a brief stint as a No 8 before moving to the front row after joining Exeter University, where the biological sciences undergraduate started to reap the benefits of her diving background as a hooker.

""The flexibility I developed doing diving has made a massive difference for rugby,"" says Hanlon. ""It means, in a scrum, you get strength from slightly weirder positions. I've got the flexibility and strength to get and stay low and I do think it's helped with injury prevention.

""It's a different type of strength. Diving was more about bodyweight strength. Rugby is more [a case of] 'I need to be stronger than someone else'. I do think the core strength has stayed with me relatively well and has helped a lot.""

She describes her experience with the Red Roses at St George's Park in Burton last week as ""nerve-racking"" but was glowing in her praise of Mitchell, whose first task will be to mastermind the defence of England's Six Nations crown.

""Everyone seems to really like him,"" says Hanlon. ""He's got a great energy and made everyone feel welcome without bombarding them. I would have struggled without the Chiefs girls there - it's not often you see a lot of new faces that often in a completely new place.""

Like Maisie Allen, Merryn Doidge and hotshot winger Katie Buchanan, Hanlon has come through Exeter's successful university programme. In a positive sign for a club that has struggled to meet Premiership Women's Rugby's match-day rules on English players of late, all four youngsters were involved in the Red Roses' three-day camp.

""Producing our own Red Roses is a big focus for us,"" insists Steve Salvin, Exeter Chiefs' women's assistant coach. ""The Red Roses don't tend to move around the country massively, the majority of them are pretty settled where they are and the spread of them is relatively limited.""

It was Poppy Leitch, Exeter's captain and head coach of Exeter University's women's team, who spotted Hanlon's ability and invited her to Chiefs training. Hanlon was swiftly contracted, before Salvin clocked her potential as a tighthead.

""When you get a player of Lizzie's stature, they're always worth investing in,"" adds Salvin. ""She turned up from university having not played a lot of rugby up until that point - she'd done more diving than rugby - but we've always felt she had good international potential. The England guys recognise that and we hope it's the first of many call-ups.""

Women's rugby is no stranger to talent crossovers; England centre Emily Scarratt dropped a collegiate basketball career to become one of the sport's best players while Shaunagh Brown was a Commonwealth Games hammer thrower before switching to rugby. In Hanlon, English rugby might have unearthed another - and a potential Six Nations bolter.",Lizzie Hanlon has been called up to the Exeter Chiefs' Women's Six Nations squad.

2024-02-01,Lewis Hamilton in talks to join Ferrari from Mercedes for 2025 season,"The seven-time world champion would join up with Charles Leclerc at the Italian team

Lewis Hamilton is expected to make a shock move from Mercedes to Formula One rivals Ferrari for the 2025 season.

Telegraph Sport understands Mercedes have put out an internal announcement with everyone called to a team briefing at 14:00 with team principal Toto Wolff and technical director James Allison. All team members are encouraged to attend.

Several reports claim talks between the seven-time world champion have been held with the Italian team with a view of signing a deal ahead of next year.

Hamilton has just signed a new two-year deal with Mercedes but there are claims the second year was optional. Ferrari want the British driver to join Charles Leclerc with Carlos Sainz only contracted until the end of this upcoming season.

The 39-year-old has not won a race for two seasons since being denied a record eighth title in 2021 in controversial circumstances by Max Verstappen in the final race of the season. He finished third in last year's drivers' championship after achieving six podium finishes.

Reacting to the reports, Sky F1's Karun Chandhok said: ""Biggest driver move shock since..... Lewis left Mclaren for Mercedes! Thought that Lewis would end his career at Merc but a chance to have a blast in the red car may have lured him in.""

When contacted by Telegraph Sport, Mercedes declined to comment.

2024-02-01,The working-class Glaswegian woman defending BT from takeover,"Allison Kirkby will need to hit the ground running when she takes the helm this week

As Allison Kirkby takes the reins at BT on Thursday, she will be acutely aware of the task facing her.

As chief executive of the former monopoly, Kirkby will be in charge of a lumbering £11bn behemoth that employs 130,000 people across divisions including the EE mobile network and broadband unit Openreach.

However, BT's difficulties are not limited to scale. The company is facing the prospect of a major new rival as Vodafone and Three aim to combine forces in a £15bn mobile merger.

Competition from alternative broadband providers, which are racing to roll out their own full-fibre networks, also remains strong.

That is without considering that BT's shares are at near three-year lows, putting the company at risk of a potential takeover bid.

Both French billionaire Patrick Drahi and German telecoms giant Deutsche Telekom have scented an opportunity in the past 18 months by building up their stakes.

So as Kirkby settles into the top job, she faces a fundamental question - does she attempt to shake up BT, or merely keep a steady hand on the tiller?

""This is one of the most difficult jobs in Britain and there's no shortage of people who think they can do it,"" says one veteran industry source. ""But often they're having to run just to stand still.""

Kirkby, who was born to a working-class family in Glasgow, boasts an impressive CV.

Cutting her teeth at consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble, much like her two predecessors, she then joined Virgin Media.

After then being overlooked for the role of finance chief at Manchester United, Kirkby decamped to Scandinavia where she led a string of mobile companies, most recently Sweden's Telia.

Now, the 56-year-old has returned to the UK to become the first female chief executive in BT's 180-year history.

Kirkby is widely viewed as the continuity candidate. Having served as a non-executive director on BT's board since 2019, she is well-versed in the ways of the sprawling telecoms giant.

""She's all signed up to the strategy,"" says Karen Egan, head of mobile at Enders Analysis. ""Nonetheless, you will expect her to want to make her own mark somewhat, and I suppose there's probably a bit of nervousness about what that might look like.""

The industry source adds: ""It is a little bit of a dilemma in a sense that she's been billed as continuity but shareholders can't be happy. It is unimaginable they're sitting there thinking everything's great.""

Long line of challenges

If Kirkby is seeking a challenge to make her mark, she has plenty to choose from. Looming large is the planned merger between Vodafone and Three, which will create the UK's biggest mobile operator with more than 27m customers.

The deal threatens to create a rival that will challenge EE's dominance at the top end of the market.

As a result, Kirkby is expected to reconsider the split of capital expenditure between fixed and mobile services, potentially siphoning money away from the broadband rollout to provide EE with more financial firepower.

Yet BT must continue to commit billions of pounds to its Openreach division as it faces tough competition from so-called alt-net rivals such as Cityfibre, which are building their own full-fibre networks.

In November, BT said it lost 155,000 broadband customers and warned losses could top 400,000 across 2024.

""We've got to go as big as we possibly can on both mobile and fibre,"" says one insider.

As a result, other parts of the group may be up for review.

In 2022, BT merged its ailing enterprise and global divisions in a move it said would save £100m. But the newly combined sector continues to lag the wider company, with profits tumbling 11pc in the first half of the year.

BT as a whole reported a 15pc year-on-year jump in pre-tax profits to £1.5bn for the nine months to the end of December on Thursday, driven by inflation-busting price rises.

Sources said Kirkby has concerns about the efficiency of BT Digital, an IT division led by Harmeen Mehta, and could review this structure.

Leadership changes could be on the cards, too. It is widely expected that Kirkby will look for a new chief financial officer to replace Simon Lowth, who has held the position since 2016.

There are also questions over the future of EE boss Marc Allera after he was overlooked for the top job.

The most radical option would be an attempt to spin off the consumer EE division.

BT is prioritising investment in EE and is pushing it into new areas such as smart fridges and insurance.

Such a move would be less complicated than the long-mooted spin-off of Openreach, which is more closely linked to BT's pension scheme. Yet it would still mark the biggest shake-up of the telecoms giant in years.

Investors try to call the shots

As Kirkby mulls these options, she is facing unwanted scrutiny from investors.

BT is being shorted by hedge fund Kintbury Capital amid concerns the stock is relatively illiquid, with power concentrated among a few large shareholders.

More concerningly, there are signs these investors could be plotting a swoop.

French billionaire Patrick Drahi has increased his shareholding in BT to 24.5pc, just shy of a blocking stake. At 25pc he would be able to oppose shareholder resolutions.

Drahi has said he does not intend to make a takeover offer, but his manoeuvres have sparked concerns internally about his ""creeping control"".

Meanwhile, BT is working with advisers at Robey Warshaw and Goldman Sachs amid fears that Deutsche Telekom, which owns a 12pc stake, is preparing a takeover offer.

A potential bid is not without its complications. Drahi's stake-building has already attracted a national security review and any German swoop would also likely come under scrutiny, given the critical nature of BT's infrastructure.

This could be further complicated by the arrival of a Labour government, which is likely to take a dim view of any further attempts to cut BT's heavily unionised workforce.

There are more prosaic difficulties, too. BT has the largest private sector pension scheme in the UK, with roughly 270,000 members and £37bn of assets.

In November, bosses announced the company had shrunk the deficit by £4.7bn and said it was on track to eliminate it by 2030. Still, pension liabilities have long muddied the water for any break-up or acquisition of BT.

Rising interest rates have also taken their toll on BT's finances as it invests billions of pounds into its full-fibre network. Net debt stood at £19.7bn at the end of September - an eye-watering sum that could also act as a deterrent to potential suitors.

Nevertheless, Kirkby will be acutely aware of the takeover threat, and staving it off will be a key priority.

More rational chapter

Insiders expect Kirkby to be more hands-on than her predecessor Philip Jansen, who courted controversy over ill-advised comments that the full-fibre race would ""end in tears"" for BT's rivals.

Greg Mesch, chief executive of Cityfibre, says he expects BT to move into ""more of a rational environment"" under Kirkby's leadership.

He adds: ""Philip took the spray and pray approach, which is to put [full-fibre] out there everywhere and hope that competition goes away. That didn't really work.""

Kirkby must also look to build relations with staff and unions as she pushes through plans to cut 55,000 jobs by the end of the decade.

""She'll have to give people a sense of purpose, a sense of direction,"" says the industry source. ""These are the usual things when a new chief executive comes in - they've got to create hope, and keep hope alive.""

As Kirkby takes up the top job, she must decide whether continuity or change is the right answer.

The latter may be easier said than done, though. Many a new BT boss has promised radical overhaul, only to be swept up in the behemoth's bureaucracy.

""I'm not a huge fan of all this tinkering and restructuring in telecoms companies, just to make your mark as a new chief executive,"" says Egan. ""BT is not a place for revolutions.""","Allison Kirkby is the first female chief executive in BT's 180-year history. She will be in charge of a £11bn behemoth that employs 130,000 people.

2024-02-01,The secret to booking a flight with no other passengers,"Each year, hundreds of 'ghost flights' take off with just a handful of passengers. Here's how to boost your chances of finding one

There are two holy grails of air travel, moments of such unexpected serendipity that they are recounted to friends and family for years to come. The first is the free upgrade, when, usually at the check-in desk, you're informed that, due to your frequent-flyer status - or simply your dashing good looks and Savile Row suit - you needn't spend the next nine hours with your kneecaps in your face like the rest of the plebs.

The second is rarer, and no less sweet. You might have an inkling as you're waiting to board. ""Am I at the wrong gate?"" you wonder, as other passengers fail to materialise. Then you board the plane to discover you have it largely - or even entirely - to yourself. A private-jet experience for a fraction of the price.

Such a scenario was seen on an Emirates flight from the Seychelles to Switzerland last Christmas, when a mother and her daughter (Kimmy Chedel and Zoe Doyle) were the only passengers in the economy-class cabin. Similar cases last year were reported on flights from Faro to Belfast (with Jet2), from Ibiza to Jersey (with Blue Islands), from Oklahoma City to Charlotte (with American Airlines) and from Fiji to Sydney (with Virgin Australia).

So how common are these ""ghost flights""? And can you boost your chances of experiencing one?

One thing is certain: with airlines increasingly quick to ditch routes that aren't profitable, often able to switch to smaller aircraft in the event of poor sales, and more adept at filling their cabins - with agile algorithms and AI determining ticket prices to ensure every seat is sold - they are becoming rarer.

Before 2000, a passenger load factor (PLF) of around 70 per cent was the norm. In 2005, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the global average was 75.1 per cent; in 2011 it was 78.1 per cent; in 2019 it reached a record high of 82.6 per cent. This means that, on a typical flight with room for 200 passengers, around 35 seats will be empty.

The Covid pandemic briefly arrested the rise of aviation's collective PLF. Indeed, it was a great time for ""socially distanced"" travel. ""I had the entire premium economy section of an Emirates A380 - 56 seats and three bathrooms - to myself on a flight from Heathrow to Dubai in January 2020,"" said John Arlidge, an aviation expert and frequent flyer. ""Three months later, I was one of only five passengers in Club World on a BA service from Mexico City to Gatwick.""

Travel has returned to normal - and PLFs are back to pre-pandemic levels, but, even with the high-tech tactics now used to fill every plane, and the importance of profit above prestige, near-empty flights do still occur.

Why? John Strickland, an aviation consultant, explained: ""If an aircraft is operating almost empty on a particular flight, it is likely that it will be pretty full in the other direction so cannot be cancelled. Another factor might be that cargo is being carried which may mean that the flight is still profitable."" Furthermore, airlines lose their valuable airport slots if they are not sufficiently used - at least 80 per cent of the time, under current rules (though there are proposals to overhaul these) - incentivising carriers to plough on even when a flight has sold poorly.

So what are the best tactics if you want to find yourself surrounded by empty seats?

The late show

Choosing an unappealing departure time is one obvious move.

""There's no way to 'ensure' you end up on an empty flight, but you can certainly place good bets,"" said Gilbert Ott, creator of the travel blog godsavethepoints.com. ""Between New York and London, for example, the last flight of the day (in both directions) will typically be the most quiet, as business travellers prefer earlier flights. There's often a lot of space in all cabins on the VS25 (Virgin's 8.25pm departure) and BA183 (BA's 7pm departure) going to New York.""

Generally speaking, summer is when planes are most likely to be full, and winter when the number of empty seats is at its highest. According to the IATA, the average PLF in Europe is 87 per cent in July, and only 73 per cent in February.

Flying during public holidays can also increase your chances. In the aforementioned example, Kimmy Chedel and Zoe Doyle struck gold with Emirates on a Christmas Day departure, and Henry Harteveldt, a leading US-based aviation analyst, added: ""I have seen a number of people posting how they're the only passenger, or one of very few, on flights on major holidays such as Christmas, Thanksgiving in the US, and New Year's morning.""

Conversely, flying with a budget airline is likely to lessen your chances. Ryanair is the undisputed master when it comes to putting bums on seats, with a PLF that ranges from 92 per cent in low season to 96 per cent in summer. EasyJet's was 89.2 per cent for 2023, Jet2's was 90.7 per cent. Conversely, the likes of British Airways, Emirates and Lufthansa normally fill around 80 per cent of their seats, while Etihad's PLF rarely tops 75 per cent.

The weirder the better

Harteveldt also recommended flying to or from smaller cities for the best hope of getting some breathing room, as well as with airlines on a route which they are not well known for offering. Opting for a recently launched (but, in an ideal world, not heavily publicised) service, therefore, might bear fruit. Furthermore, if you hear that an airline has just discontinued a route (likely a response to low demand), boarding one of the final services could provide that private-jet experience.

Civil Aviation Authority data confirms that opting for an offbeat route can pay dividends. During the first quarter of 2023, for example, every flight from Gatwick to Mauritius had at least 50 passengers on board, as did 99 per cent of flights from Heathrow to Barbados. Surprise, surprise: flights to tropical idylls during the peak winter season are usually full. But over the same period, 24 per cent of flights from Heathrow to Bulgaria, 39 per cent of flights from the UK to Azerbaijan and 83 per cent of flights from Britain to Kazakhstan carried fewer than 50 passengers. Does an empty cabin make swapping the Caribbean for Kazakhstan worthwhile? That's for you to decide.

A game of 'tag'

Then there's the existence of what Harteveldt called ""tag"" routes. ""These are the continuation of a route from an airline's home base or hub, where they are less known and where their load factors may be lower,"" he explained. ""There aren't too many of these left, since aircraft now have better range, and it's expensive to operate these flights (if it's a long-haul route, there's likely a crew change required, and the various crews will of course have to have an adequate rest period between their flights). Sydney-Christchurch, offered by Emirates, is one example, likely a tag on Dubai-Sydney. A friend of mine just flew this service and was the only passenger in the premium cabin.

""I also believe KLM flies between Buenos Aires and Santiago, a continuation of the airline's Amsterdam-Buenos Aires route. Likewise, it operates an Amsterdam-Singapore flight that continues to Bali. And Air France operates Los Angeles-Tahiti as a tag from one of its Paris-Los Angeles flights.""

'Vanity' flights

Once upon a time, airlines operated some routes simply for prestige. If your arch rival flies London to JFK, so must you - never mind the empty seats and financial losses. Politics can play a part too. In 2015 it was even alleged that United launched flights from Newark to Columbia, South Carolina, as a favour to the former chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Then there are unprofitable routes kept open thanks to government subsidies (in the UK, these are called public service obligation routes and include those used to connect Scottish Islands airports and Glasgow).

These are now few and far between. ""However, airlines will run extra flights between key hubs as a defensive tactic,"" said Ott. ""There are many times a year when airlines will run multiple daily flights to, say, Santorini, just to offer more choice, even though they can't actually really sell all the available seats. Being able to offer that choice is designed to capture more bookings and win across the entire day. This is common on routes like London-Dubai, where frequency is important.""

Ott added that disruption often creates the empty-flight scenarios that garner headlines: ""I've experienced them myself during irregular operations when a flight had been cancelled or heavily delayed and only a few stragglers remained and ended up on the plane."" Every cloud has a silver lining.

Will my flight be empty?

So you've booked your flight to Kazakhstan, flying on Christmas Day, with the most unsociable departure time available - can you find out in advance how busy the cabin will be?

""It's difficult to know how full, or empty, your flight may be,"" said Harteveldt. ""You can't really go by the seat map for your flight, because seat maps don't reflect the number of reservations, only the number of people who have selected a seat at that moment. Remember that airlines may charge to reserve a seat before flight check-in opens. As a result, passengers may wait to select their seats when check-in opens and they can choose their seat for free.""

Ott added: ""I used to use a tool called ExpertFlyer to look up live seat maps and outfox people to grab the right seats in economy to get a whole row. The better hack now is to be among the last to board and to ask the gate agent if there's any gaps in seating you can take advantage of.""

What happens on an empty flight

So you've hit the ghost-flight jackpot - now what? You'll have plenty of room for your bag in the overhead bin, a more attentive cabin crew (on the Jet2 flight mentioned earlier, the cabin crew kept referring to their only passenger as ""King Paul"" while the American Airlines flyer was given ""all the food and drink I wanted""), and fewer people coughing, snoring and hanging around in the aisle with their backside in your face.

And surely an upgrade to business class? Think again. Just because those seats up front are empty, don't assume the cabin crew will offer you one. That was the case with Kimmy Chedel and Zoe Doyle last Christmas, when the premium seats on their Emirates flight remained off-limits. And when Kai Forsyth from Derbyshire was the only passenger on board a BA flight from Heathrow to Orlando in January 2022, he too was denied the pleasure of a premium seat and forced to make do with turning his economy-class row into a makeshift bed.

2024-02-01,"The Zone of Interest, review:  Jonathan Glazer's Auschwitz film is horrifying in its banality","Devastating and vital, the Under the Skin director's Oscar-nominated drama shows how evil can flourish in the most mundane circumstances

Meet Rudolph and Hedwig Höss (Christian Friedel and Sandra Hüller): a young, attractive, well-to-do German couple who live with their five children in a neat, spacious house in the bucolic Polish countryside. Friends and family often come to visit: their large, well-tended garden is perfect for hosting parties, and there's a picturesque river nearby ideal for swimming and picnics. Their main reason for living here, however, is convenience, since it's right next door to Rudolph's work. On the far side of the unusually tall garden wall lies the Auschwitz concentration camp, where, since the age of 38, he has served as commandant.

As the family eats dinner together, the rumble of industrialised murder can be heard faintly in the background, sometimes punctuated by a pistol crack. Later, as Rudolph contentedly smokes a cigar in the garden, the glow of its tip mimics the flames which claw at the night sky from the crematorium smoke stack behind.

For his first film since 2013's Under the Skin, the British director Jonathan Glazer has returned with a loose adaptation of the 2014 Martin Amis novel The Zone of Interest, but very little of the source apart from the bones of its premise remains. Amis's book was like PG Wodehouse via a nightmare - a sort of Arbeit Macht Frei, Jeeves, in which a handful of Auschwitz bosses witter on about their professional, social and carnal travails.

Glazer drops the fictional characters and presents instead the actual historical figures, even shooting on an exact reproduction of the Hösses' grace-and-favour house. This building becomes the film's base of operations: every room has been rigged with multiple static cameras which coolly survey the family's daily routine - recognisable, everyday stuff spiked with moments of pure cruelty and outrage, as their activities and conversations have to in some way accommodate the monstrous happenings just outside.

Hedwig jokes about her friend having misunderstood her when she described a new fur coat as having come from ""Canada"": the name of the storage facility used to house the Jewish inmates' pillaged belongings.

2024-02-01,Farmers protest live: Angry farmers tear down statue of British industrialist outside EU parliament,"A statue raised in tribute to a British industrialist has been pulled down as farmers protest in front of the European Parliament in Brussels.

The ""steelworker"" is part of the monument to John Cockerill, the steel baron who helped transform Belgium into a 19th-century industrial titan. It has been previously targeted by Extinction Rebellion activists.

A thousand tractors descended on Brussels this morning as farmers from across Europe headed to the Belgian capital to protest the bloc's environmental regulations and net zero ambitions.

While demonstrations have largely been peaceful, tensions rose yesterday as 79 farmers were arrested for storming the Rungis international market in France.

9:53AM Pictures: Farmers protest outside EU parliament as crowds grow 9:49AM Dozens of French supermarkets blocked by tractors

French farmers blocked 50 supermarkets in four Haute-Loire communes overnight to denounce the ""inappropriate"" behaviour of supermarkets, the FDSEA 43 union said.

Henry Samuel reports:

""Around 200 tractors, around 50 for each of the four towns targeted, dumped trailers of tyres and rubbish to block the entrances [to supermarkets]"", Yannick Fialip, chairman of the FDSEA 43 economic committee, told AFP.

This coordinated action aimed to ""denounce the inappropriate behaviour of supermarkets"", which are ""putting crazy pressure on our farmers (...) with suffocating margins""; and to express farmers' desire to be ""paid properly"".

Carrefour, Lidl, Aldi and Casino stores were targeted in the Brioude, Yssingeaux, Craponne and Monistrol areas. This operation comes as trade negotiations between supermarkets and their agro-industrial suppliers on shelf prices ""ended at midnight on Thursday"", he said.

The farmers are part of a wider European movement railing against EU policies, such as the bloc's Net Zero ambitions, that they argue are killing the agricultural industry, Joe Barnes reports.

By 9am local time, farmers had lit fires on Place Du Luxembourg, a roundabout in front of the European Parliament building.

""You have seen the farmers' demonstrations. We need to discuss this at the European Council. The concerns expressed by farmers are partly legitimate,"" Belgian prime minister Alexander De Croo said arriving at the EU summit.

""They have already made a great deal of effort. We must ensure that they receive a fair price for the quality products they produce. And that the administrative burden on them remains bearable,"" he added.

9:42AM Brussels 'awoken by the sound of 1,000 tractors'

Brussels was awoken by the sound of 1,000 tractors descending on the city in protest as European Union leaders gathered there for talks, Joe Barnes reports.

The convoy headed straight for the Belgian capital's European Quarter, the home of the European Council's Justus Lipsius and Europa buildings hosting the summit.

While a heavy police presence and sprawling security cordons prevented the farmers from reaching the venue, tractors were spotted snarling up the roads leading to the nearby European Parliament.

This journalist was woken at 5am local time as a nearby ring road was subjected to vicious blasts from tractor horns singing in chorus as they approached Brussels.

Major traffic tunnels to and from the city's main train station were also closed to traffic during rush hour, police said.

2024-02-01,"Carmakers could be complicit in abuse of China's Uyghurs, report says","Human Rights Watch says the industry could be using metals tainted by forced labour, as part of the exploitation of ethnic Muslims

The car manufacturing industry could be complicit in the exploitation and abuse of China's Uyghur groups, new research alleges.

More than nine percent of the global supply of aluminium, a lightweight metal used in dozens of car parts, comes from Xinjiang, where Chinese authorities have long been accused of repressive tactics against the region's 12 million Uyghurs and other ethnic Muslim groups.

Most of the metal produced in Xinjiang's factories is shipped to different regions of China and mixed with other metals to make aluminium alloys. These alloys have multiple purposes, including for the car industry, in which they are used for engine blocks, vehicle frames and much more.

However, the mixing of aluminium with other materials makes it impossible to determine whether or how much of it came from Xinjiang and if the metal has been tainted by forced labour, says the report from Human Rights Watch (HRW).

Carmakers, including General Motors, Tesla, BYD, Toyota, and Volkswagen, have done too little to map their aluminium supply chains and identify links to forced labour, concludes the report, titled ""Asleep at the Wheel: Car Companies' Complicity in Forced Labour in China.""

It says the threat of Chinese government retaliation deters companies from talking to their China-based suppliers about potential links to rights abuses in Xinjiang's aluminium industry.

Jim Wormington, a senior researcher and advocate for corporate accountability at Human Rights Watch, said: ""Car companies simply don't know the extent of their links to forced labour in Xinjiang in their aluminium supply chains.

""Consumers should know their cars might contain materials linked to forced labour or other abuses in Xinjiang.""

According to HRW, the risk of coercion in the aluminium industry is linked to Chinese government-backed labour transfer programmes, which force Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims into jobs in Xinjiang and other parts of the country.

The rights group cites ""credible evidence"" from Chinese state media articles, company reports and government statements to back up its research. It also reports that fossil fuel companies supplying coal to Xinjiang's aluminium producers have received labour transfer workers at their coal mines.

The report draws heavily from a 2022 report by Sheffield Hallam University and the NomoGaia group on links between aluminium smelters in Xinjiang and major global carmakers, as well as research on links between the region's smelters and labour transfer schemes.

'Crimes against humanity'

Beijing denies committing human rights abuses in Xinjiang and says its actions, which have included the detention of an estimated more than one million Uyghurs, have focused on fighting terrorism and separatism.

Asked about the HRW report, the Chinese embassy in London responded that ""certain forces in the world, out of their ideological bias and anti-China agenda, have been smearing Xinjiang's effort to ensure employment and job security by hyping up the allegation of 'forced labour'.""

In a statement it said such behaviour sought to curb China's development and undermine global economic and trade rules and supply chains, adding that ""malicious smearing is in nobody's interest and should be unanimously opposed by the international community.""

But in 2022, a damning report by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet alleged serious rights violations including arbitrary incarceration, accusations of torture, forced sterilisations, mass surveillance and coerced labour, may constitute ""crimes against humanity.""

In 2023, domestic and foreign manufacturers in China produced and exported more cars than any other country.

Meanwhile, Xinjiang's aluminium production grew from approximately one million tons in 2010 to six million tons in 2022.

HRW contacted all five carmakers for comment. The Telegraph also contacted the companies and the Chinese embassy to the UK.

General Motors, Toyota, and Volkswagen all manufacture their cars in China through joint ventures with Chinese car manufacturers.

Volkswagen said it takes a ""firm stand against forced labour"" worldwide and that it was already implementing processes to safeguard human rights, including in China, which were under active review.

""For the particularly sensitive raw materials supply chains, we have also implemented a risk management system for due diligence in the procurement of raw materials,"" the company said, adding that all suppliers were required to comply with its code of conduct and could face contract termination for forced labour violations.

General Motors said: ""GM is committed to conducting due diligence and working collaboratively with industry partners, stakeholders, and organisations to address any potential risks related to forced labour in our supply chain.""

Tesla provided the most detailed information to HRW about its aluminium sourcing, saying it had intensified mapping to combat forced labour. It said that it had ""in several cases"" mapped its supply chain back to the mining level and had not found any evidence of such violations.

But HRW pointed out that the company did not specify how much of the aluminium in its cars remains of unknown origin and could be linked to Xinjiang.

Tesla said it is ""committed to ensuring that our supply chain - from raw materials to final products - is free"" of abuses, adding that ""we will not knowingly accept products or services from suppliers that include forced labour or human trafficking in any form.""

General Motors, Toyota, and the Chinese car company BYD did not respond to HRW questions about oversight of Chinese joint ventures, supply chain mapping, or the origin of their aluminium.

In interviews with HRW, unnamed car industry staff and sourcing experts said there were steps they could take to push Chinese suppliers towards more supply chain transparency, and that carmakers could also source more aluminium from smelters outside of Xinjiang.

The rights group said governments should step up to pass laws requiring companies to disclose their supply chains and identify potential links to human rights abuses.

""China is a dominant player in the global car industry and governments need to ensure that companies building cars or sourcing parts in China are not tainted by the government's repression in Xinjiang,"" Mr Wormington said.

""Doing business in China should not mean having to use or benefit from forced labour.""

What is the latest England team news?

George Ford looks to have won the starting fly-half role ahead of the uncapped Fin Smith and is set to partner veteran scrum-half Danny Care against Italy on Saturday.

Telegraph Sport understands that England head coach Steve Borthwick had been planning on starting Marcus Smith, only for the Harlequins playmaker to suffer a calf injury on Monday. That left it as a straight shootout between the 91-capped Ford and Smith, Northampton Saints' precocious 21-year-old, and experience won out over form. Smith would make his debut if he comes off the bench against Italy.

The midfield will be made up of Northampton's Fraser Dingwall, who makes his long-awaited England debut at inside centre, and Henry Slade, who missed out on selection for the World Cup. There's further Northampton representation in the back three in the form of wing Tommy Freeman, alongside full-back Freddie Steward and wing Elliot Daly.

2024-02-01,Dissident rock band Bi-2 leave Thailand after Russia deportation fears,"Human rights groups had urged Thai government not to deport Russian-Belarusian band, who are now in Israel

A dissident Russian-Belarusian rock band critical of the war in Ukraine have left Thailand for Israel after fears they would be deported to Russia under suspected pressure from the Kremlin.

Seven members of the Bi-2 group were detained by Thai immigration authorities last Wednesday on the resort island of Phuket for working without a permit. The band were touring in Phuket, a holiday destination popular with Russian tourists.

After paying a fine, the band members were sent to an immigration detention centre in Bangkok.

Human rights groups had urged the Thai government not to deport Bi-2 to Russia, where the members could face severe persecution.

Bi-2's arrests grew into a larger diplomatic scandal as several of the group's members held Israeli passports.

Speaking in the arrival hall of Ben Gurion International airport in Tel Aviv, the Bi-2 guitarist and singer Aleksandr ""Shura"" Uman thanked Israeli and American diplomats, as well as human rights organisations, for their work in bringing them to Israel.

The Israeli foreign minister, Israel Katz, praised diplomatic efforts that had enabled all the musicians to leave Thailand for Israel.

Bi-2's lead singer, Igor Bortnik, accused Moscow of orchestrating the band's arrest.

""We were all told that there was a Russian trace, a special order from the Russian consulate for the band Bi-2 to extradite us to Russia,"" Bortnik said.

Citing a source with direct knowledge of the incident, the Guardian previously reported that Bi-2 were detained in Phuket after a request by Vladimir Sosnov, the Russian consul in Phuket.

Russia has denied any role in getting the band arrested.

However, when asked about Bi-2's arrest, Maria Zakharova, a Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, accused the group of sponsoring terrorism by publicly supporting Ukraine, raising fears they may face criminal charges in Russia.

The Kremlin also has a long track record of cracking down on artists critical of the war, including those working abroad.

Observers said Bi-2's arrests could be a stark warning to other artists who criticise Moscow but perform abroad, despite the Kremlin's efforts to frame them as ""unpatriotic"".

Bi-2 have been one of the most successful Russian-language rock bands since the end of the Soviet Union, and are known for their condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Their lead singer, Bortnik, was labelled by Russian authorities as a ""foreign agent"" after he criticised Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, online.

Human Rights Watch's deputy Asia director, Phil Robertson, praised the decision not to send the musicians back to Russia.

""Very good news that all band members of the Russian-Belorussian rock band Bi-2 were able to leave Thailand, and go safely to Israel,"" Robertson wrote on X.

""Appreciate that the Thai foreign ministry recognized the importance of upholding human rights principles, & didn't send them to face persecution & worse in Russia.""",Seven members of Russian-Belarusian rock band Bi-2 left Thailand for Israel.

2024-02-01,"Catalonia declares drought emergency, extending restrictions to Barcelona","Water reserves fall below 16% as region's president says it has not rained in some areas for three years

After more than 1,000 days of drought, the Catalan government has formally announced a state of emergency, extending water restrictions to Barcelona and the surrounding region.

Announcing the measures on Thursday, Pere Aragonès, the Catalan president, said that in some areas it had not rained at all for three years, describing the situation as the worst drought in modern history.

It is estimated that 500mm of rain needs to fall in Catalonia to make up the deficit. Water reserves have fallen below 16%, a level low enough to trigger the emergency declaration.

Measures already in place in the north of the region, including a 20% reduction in agricultural irrigation and a ban on watering public parks, will be extended to Barcelona.

Public and private swimming pools will close, with exemptions for those in sports centres, although some pools are adapting to use sea water. Parks will no longer be watered but groundwater will be used to save the city's 35,000 trees from dying.

There will be no showers on the beach nor ornamental fountains. Water parks and ice rinks will close and car washing is to be limited to commercial use. The restrictions will remain in force for at least the next 15 months.

Plans to reduce water pressure have been shelved, partly because Barcelonans are keeping within a daily consumption limit of 200 litres and also because nearly everyone lives in blocks of flats and a pressure drop would discriminate against those living on upper floors.

The situation in Barcelona would be far worse were it not home to Europe's largest desalination plant, built after the last serious drought in 2008, which supplies the city with 33% of its drinking water. A further 25% comes from recycled wastewater.

However, it costs three times as much to produce a litre of desalinated water through reverse osmosis as it does to take water from rivers and reservoirs.

It also consumes a lot of energy, not all of which as yet comes from renewable sources and therefore exacerbates the root problem by adding to global emissions.

As the Barcelona restrictions extend into summer, they are likely to fuel simmering resentment towards tourists, who are perceived as overwhelming public services, such as some bus routes, to the exclusion of local people.

Tourists consume much more water than residents. Research carried out by the hoteliers' association showed that in 2016 a guest in a five-star hotel used 545 litres of water a day, compared with residents' consumption of 163 litres. The association claims tourist consumption has since been reduced to 242 litres.

The drought is not confined to the north-east of Spain. In Andalucía, in southern Spain, two successive hot, dry summers have devastated the olive harvest, reducing production by 50% and doubling the price of olive oil. The grape harvest has also been poor in much of the country as even vines struggle to survive.

Tourist industry bosses say that while it's easy to point the finger at golf courses and swimming pools, 80% of Spain's water is consumed by agriculture.

Long before the climate crisis entered the equation, Spain was living beyond its means in terms of water, damming and diverting its few major rivers to irrigate the market gardens in the southern desert regions of Almería and Murcia.

While agriculture accounts for only about 2.3% of GDP and employs only 4% of the workforce, it punches above its weight in politics, as became clear when the government tried to restrict water use on the vast strawberry farms in the south-west.

Spain has always had periods of drought but climatologists largely agree that the droughts are getting longer while rainfall diminishes and temperatures continue to rise.","Catalan government declares state of emergency after 1,000 days of drought.

2024-02-01,Till the Stars Come Down review - your invitation to the wedding of the year,"Dorfman theatre, London

Beth Steel's new drama is dazzlingly performed and full of pain, joy and laughter in a deft production by Bijan Sheibani

A wedding day is fertile ground for a family drama but is also riddled with the risk of cliches: drunken flirting, face-offs between estranged siblings, awkward aunts and, of course, an 11th-hour dress crisis.

Beth Steel's play has them all, so how is it that it seems spun in gold, the earthy humour tingling with originality, the canvas both big and small and the larger-than-life characters dazzlingly performed and bouncing to life before us in pain, joy, and laughter?

Sylvia (Sinéad Matthews), one of a trio of sisters, is getting married to Polish Marek (Marc Wootton), who is welcomed into the family fold reluctantly. In Mansfield, a former pit town which has a newly arrived eastern European population, those tensions run organically alongside the human drama. Steel's previous plays were also set in the same deindustrialised East Midlands landscape, but more often explored the politics around its former coalminers and their families. This play brings the women blazingly to the fore.

They are all forces of nature, from Sylvia's sisters, Maggie (Lisa McGrillis) and Hazel (Lucy Black), to their fantastically gobby aunt Carol (Lorraine Ashbourne). They are broadly drawn, but distinct enough to become real and endearing. You feel part of the wedding, investing in the characters and their emotional lives.

The fathers, uncles and love interests are all off stage at first, while these women get ready for the big day. They drink Buck's Fizz, bitch about next door's hot-tub (""sex pond""), and talk in vivid demotic (""I don't know my arsehole from my fanny this morning,"" says Carol). This opening scene alone is a masterclass in multi-layered conversational naturalism.

The sisters' mother is dead and their father, Tony (Alan Williams), is embroiled in a rift of many decades with his brother, Pete (Philip Whitchurch). There are bursts of music, drunken disorder, betrayal, intrigues and shocks alongside the dull pain of everyday marital compromise.

Deftly directed by Bijan Sheibani, the production has a busy naturalism with sudden pauses and sparks of interiority, and is staged beautifully within a players' chalked circle, of sorts. A disco ball overhead, on Samal Blak's simple yet exquisite set design, foreshadows the drunken evening do ahead but also brings a lovely, lyrical headiness.

The migration debate is incorporated into the histories of the men, once miners, now unemployed or forced to work away on submarines, or stack shelves in the warehouse that has replaced the town's pit. The issues are never preached but are delivered through drama. One grandchild does not even know of Mansfield's mining history, while uncle Pete stands up at the wedding dinner to name each of the closed pits, one by one, in what sounds like a liturgical chant, powerfully demonstrating how some of these characters are still living in the past.

The only element that feels slightly askew is Marek, from Wootton's accent to the character's lack of distinction. But then again, he has entered an overpowering family. It is they who are the central players as the wedding party whirls into melodrama of a high order - rollicking, complex and bearing the tragic inevitability of Greek drama.","A wedding day is fertile ground for a family drama but is also riddled with cliches.

2024-02-01,Five of the best books about gossip,"Cruelty, nosiness, truth-telling: whatever you call it, it appears in every community - and in plenty of works of literature too

'That is the ugliest effing skirt I've ever seen"" is among the most memorable lines from the 2004 version of Mean Girls, uttered by high-school queen bee Regina George. The musical remake, in cinemas now, inherits the original film's bitchiness and its iconic Burn Book - a scrapbook filled with cruel gossip about students and staff.

Gossip beyond school is less brazen but perhaps more insidious. As these five books suggest, gossipy networks pervade communities of all sizes, from small towns to the British political system.

When an ambassador and his glamorous wife Violet arrive in a small French town under vague reasoning, rumours fizzle at the lavoir, where a circle of women meet weekly: Violet bathes in milk and rose petals, she came from an asylum, she was a sex worker. Gossip also flies over the bakery counter, where the narrator, Elodie, works and becomes a sort of confessor for the neighbourhood, hearing of affairs and plans for revenge. ""I think that all those small and meaningless secrets gave me pleasure because they distracted me from the larger terror of it all,"" she later reflects.

In this Lagos-based graphic novel, characters see gossip as a threat, worrying about the reputational damage of whispers spreading. After the pastor's son Godstime falls in love with his guy friend and a gossip blogger writes about his sexuality, the pastor's immediate concern is whether members of his church have heard. In the Sunday service, he attempts to quash the ""whisperings of the agents of the devil"". Meanwhile, Godstime's sister reassures him that ""this is Nigeria. Something more scandalous will happen."" Ironically, the pastor is sitting on a genuinely egregious secret the whole time.

""People think Westminster is like House of Cards but it's actually more like Mean Girls - so many people come in expecting to be Francis Urquhart but they're just Regina George,"" an anonymous Conservative MP tells Le Conte. Her book explores the complex but informal networks of gossip - tidbits murmured in division lobbies, tea rooms, pubs, Portcullis House - that grease the wheels of Westminster politics and media.

The play's title is a triple entendre: in Elizabethan England, ""nothing"" was slang for ""vagina"", and was pronounced as ""no-ting"", suggesting ""noticing"" - a nod to the gossip and eavesdropping that carve the plot. A conversation about Beatrice's ""love"" for Benedick is staged for Benedick to overhear, and vice versa, which leads to the pair getting together. Later, Borachio is overheard bragging about tricking Claudio by pretending to woo his love interest, Hero, and is arrested.

""Nosey cows"", ""gobshites"", ""stupid bigmouths"", ""two-faced harpy"" - there is no shortage of savage descriptions for neighbourhood gossips in Melchor's fictional Mexican village of La Matosa. Yet, the novel itself is an artefact of hearsay, with each section moving through the perspectives of villagers connected to the death of the Witch, who is found rotting in an irrigation canal on the first page.","Gossip beyond school is less brazen but perhaps more insidious.

2024-02-01,"Sit, stay and be a good boy: 21 rules for dogs and their humans","We asked experts to describe good dog manners and how our pups should behave at home, on a walk and out on the town

You wake up in the morning. Immediately, you face a complex set of rules and norms - some spoken, others unspoken. Don't make a mess in the house. Don't yell at strangers. Don't run into the street. Let strangers sniff your butt. Only pee outside.

Sorry, I forgot to say - you're a dog.

Social etiquette is complicated enough for humans. Even with the gift of language, all of us transgress these rules from time to time. And indeed, some social norms are woefully outdated. But at its best, etiquette helps us move through the world in a way that is more pleasant for ourselves and others, whether we're human or canine.

""Any etiquette, whether it's dog or human, is about being considerate of whoever you're interacting with,"" says Susan Smith, a professional dog trainer, behavioral consultant and director of the company Raising Canine. Dogs are not humans, Smith says, and they shouldn't be expected to act like they are. It's up to dog owners to make sure they and their canine friends are behaving appropriately in any given situation. That being said, dogs ""certainly can learn human rules"", she says. ""And we can learn more about dogs. There can be some give and take.""

Dog etiquette is more relevant than ever. According to research by the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) in England, pandemic puppy owners are struggling with behavioral issues like pulling on the leash, clinginess and aggression more than owners who got their dogs before the pandemic. Experts suspect this is because pandemic social distancing made it difficult to fully socialize puppies.

Teaching our pups how to move though the world involves balancing their needs and tendencies with our own.

""Do bear in mind your dog's breed, as this impacts what is their 'normal' and what they need to be fulfilled,"" explains Louise Glazebrook, a dog behaviorist, trainer, author and TV presenter. If your dog is a breed that is designed to jump, like German shorthaired pointers or Hungarian vizslas, Glazebrook says that expecting them to keep their feet on the ground all the time isn't realistic. ""Instead, teach them to jump on and over things you want them to use.""

Basic training and good dog etiquette are important because they make life easier for both dogs and humans, says Glazebrook. ""It shows wider society that our dogs can be part of our communities and are not to be feared,"" she says. Having clear boundaries and expectations not only allows us to bring our canine companions to more places, it's also reassuring for them. ""Dogs thrive off knowing what is expected of them in a situation,"" Glazebrook says.

Above all, experts say that it's our responsibility as owners to be aware, and to not put our dogs in situations that are unsafe for them or for anyone else. Training, observation and planning can help. ""The biggest difference I've noticed between dog owners and dog professional trainers or behaviorists is that dog owners are reactive and dog pros are proactive,"" says Smith. ""We are always aware of what is going on in our environment, and if we see something down the road that our dog is going to react to, we deal with it before he's even aware.""

So how should a dog be? We spoke to five dog behavior experts about good dog etiquette, and how much of it is about humans better advocating for our dogs' needs.

Should dogs be allowed on the furniture? Everyone has their own version of what is right for them, because all of our homes are unique. My dog does go on my sofa, he is allowed on my bed and he does sleep upstairs at night. I don't believe in huge restrictions unless you are struggling with aggression issues. - Louise Glazebrook, dog behaviorist, trainer, author, TV presenter

What are the basic behaviors and boundaries at home? Encourage good manners indoors - no chewed shoes, please. Establish a cozy corner, and make ""sit"" and ""stay"" the royal commands. Reward pup for preferred behavior, such as relaxing quietly. - Dr Hannah Lau, veterinarian at BondVet

It depends on the people and what kind of relationship they want to have with their dog. I'm a dog trainer, so I tend to be a little authoritarian. To me, basic things are house training and not jumping up on counters. - Susan Smith

How much barking is OK? When it comes to balancing a dog's need to be a dog - whether it's play, greeting or territorial barking, or barking because other dogs are barking - with the need to be a good neighbor, put limits on the dog. For instance, they can bark out in the yard for a few minutes but then they have to come in and do something else (play with an enrichment toy or chew a bone) or they can bark during the day when the neighbors are at work but not in the early morning or evening.

For other types of barking, the way to curb it is to address the underlying reason why the dog is barking (like separation anxiety or frustration) -Dr Pam Reid, vice-president of the ASPCA behavioral sciences team

How should my dog act on leash? No pulling, especially towards dogs and people. But we also want to give dogs a chance to sniff and to explore their world and have fun as well. Just as long as they're not pulling their owner all over the place. - Mike Shikashio, certified dog behavior consultant, founder and CEO of aggressivedog.com

What do I do if my dog is reactive? Be observant. If you see a potential problem coming, figure out how you can avoid it. Cross the street, or turn and go the other direction. - Smith

Do I need to clean up my dog's poop? Yes, unless your dog is a registered seeing eye dog. - Common decency, and also city ordinances across the US

Does my dog need to be on a leash? If you see another dog with a lead on, put your dog on a leash if yours is off lead. You don't allow your dog to run up to other dogs uninvited. This can be really unnerving for many dogs and it can create issues for puppies who are learning about the world. I believe it is crucial that we stop letting dogs run off. You don't know anything about the dog or the person that your dog is running into. That is just being respectful of others. - Glazebrook

(Note: Check your local laws. In the US, many cities and municipalities have laws that say dogs must remain leashed except in designated off-leash areas. In the UK, rules vary between counties, but certain orders prohibit dogs from being off leash around children's play areas, sports pitches, roads, parks and beaches.)

Can my dog greet other dogs? Whenever you are out with your dog and you would like your dog to say hello to another dog, it's really important to ask that person if they want that as well, and respect it if they don't.

Not every dog wants to say hello. It's important for people to teach their dogs that they're not going to get to meet every dog they see. You distract them with treats and you get them doing other things so they learn that sometimes they're not going to get to say hello, and that's OK. - Reid

Can my dog greet other humans? The first thing to consider is if your dog actually wants to meet that stranger. If your dog doesn't want to meet someone, they don't need to - don't lure them, don't use treats to tempt them. It may backfire.

If your dog is happy to greet people, I tend to advise the person to stroke under the chin, where your dog can see the hand go, not on top of the head.

It's polite to teach our dogs not to jump up at people, while also understanding that jumping up can be the body language display of a dog that feels anxious. There's nuance there. - Glazebrook

How should my dog act at the dog park? Some dogs can play very roughly. What might look like playing to the owner could actually be bullying behavior. The easiest way to tell is if dogs start avoiding that dog, or you see inklings of aggression, like other dogs air-snapping. - Shikashio

How should I act at the dog park? Stay away from the gates - if your dog is off leash, it could get out. If you see your dog going to greet a dog coming into the park, you should get them away from that.

Pay attention. One of the biggest issues at a dog park is that owners often tend to think of it as a social interaction for them, and they're not paying attention to their dogs. - Smith

The most important rule at a dog park is that you have voice control over your dog. So if your dog is being victimized or your dog is bullying in some way, you have the ability to interrupt your dog. - Reid

Should I bring my dog to a dog-friendly restaurant? The biggest mistake that people make is thinking their dogs enjoy it, but maybe they don't. It's important people pay attention to what their dog is telling them. If their body language is indicating that they're not having a good time, maybe it's not the place for them. - Reid

How should my dog behave at a restaurant/bar? I think a dog should be able to go to a restaurant and lay under a table or close to a chair and nobody even knows he's there. Because those places are not for dogs - they are for humans. -Smith

What kind of training does my dog need to be in these spaces? It starts at home. If you can't teach your dog to lie on their mat and settle when you are eating dinner at home, I'm afraid to say you won't stand a chance when out with more distractions. -Glazebrook

Assuming my workplace is dog-friendly, should I bring my dog to work? It's really important to be aware of whether your dog is enjoying it or not. Some dogs are just not comfortable around a lot of unfamiliar dogs and people, so they're not good candidates for this kind of scenario. - Reid

How can I make my dog comfortable at work? The last time I worked in an office where dogs were allowed to come in, we made sure everyone had a little partition around their desk. That way the dogs didn't have to be tethered, which makes them potentially feel a little more vulnerable in a space, which can lead to being more fearful or potentially more aggressive. By having that little space around them with pens or gates, they can be looking out at what's going on if they choose, or they can be under your desk hanging out and chilling. - Reid

It's important to get the dog the enrichment and exercise it needs during the day: having enrichment toys like stuffed Kongs, making sure they get a break and time to sniff outside. - Shikashio

What dog behaviors are unacceptable at work? If you're in a place of business, you don't want to create an issue by having that dog jump up on a patron or a client. - Shikashio

How can I manage my dog at someone else's home? Reinforce basic commands like ""sit"" and ""stay"". - Lau

Obviously you want the dog house-trained. And follow the same rules as in their own home. Don't pee and poop on things. Don't chew things. Don't steal things. Get along with the other dog if there is one. Don't jump up on people. - Shikashio

Show them where you want them to go potty. - Smith

How can I prepare my dog to meet children? Teach your dog to be gentle and patient. Supervision is key to ensure tails are wagging, not stepping on tiny toes. - Lau

Tolerance of children is important, because we can't always control what the child is doing. But it's also important to advocate for our dog. We're not just gonna allow kids to squeeze their ears and poke them. - Shikashio

It's difficult to train and expose the dogs to this situation if they're not around a lot of children. If that's the case, you have to manage it. I'd keep my dog close so I can keep an eye on what's going on. - Smith

How should children prepare to interact with dogs? Teach children to be gentle, respectful, and to recognize cues of discomfort in dogs such as wide eyes, lip licking, yawning, leaning away or a tense mouth. - Lau

Not all dogs enjoy children. They run around, they shriek, they are unpredictable, and they can be inconsistent with rewards and hand gestures or movements. I think a great step is to teach children to throw treats for your dog on to the floor for them to sniff out. This keeps the child from being heavy-handed, prevents issues and means your dog learns to keep their distance. - Glazebrook

How should a dog behave at the vet's office? It's nerve-wracking for most dogs to go to the vet's office. The etiquette here is just helping the dog feel safe, giving them a lot of opportunities to express their choices, meaning they're not so restricted. Maybe you can ask the staff to text you when your appointment is about to begin, then take your dog out to go sniff, and throw some treats in the grass. Let them enjoy themselves outside and not be stressed inside the office. - Shikashio","Dog etiquette is more relevant than ever, says Susan Smith, a professional dog trainer.

2024-02-01,US man accused of destroying Satanic Temple statue charged with hate crime,"Michael Cassidy charged under Iowa's hate crime statute after figure depicting Baphomet 'destroyed beyond repair' in December

A Mississippi man accused of destroying a statue of a pagan idol at Iowa's state capitol is now being charged with a hate crime.

The statue was brought to the capitol by the Satanic Temple of Iowa under state rules allowing religious displays in the building during the holidays. The move drew strong criticism from state and national leaders, including the Iowa governor, Kim Reynolds, and the Florida governor and former presidential candidate Ron DeSantis, both Republicans. On 14 December, the figure depicting the horned deity Baphomet was ""destroyed beyond repair"", according to the group.

Michael Cassidy, a former congressional and legislative candidate from Mississippi, was charged the next day with fourth-degree criminal mischief, a misdemeanor. He told the conservative website the Sentinel that ""my conscience is held captive to the word of God, not to bureaucratic decree. And so I acted.""

Now, Polk county prosecutors have charged Cassidy with a more serious offense, the Des Moines Register reported. A document made public Tuesday charged him with felony third-degree criminal mischief. It alleges the act was committed ""in violation of individual rights"" under Iowa's hate crime statute.

""Evidence shows the defendant made statements to law enforcement and the public indicating he destroyed the property because of the victim's religion,"" Lynn Hicks, a spokesman for the Polk county attorney's office, said in a statement.

Cassidy's attorney, Sara Pasquale, declined to comment on the new charge. In previous court filings, she has accused the Satanic Temple of making filings that ""are only meant to evoke strong emotions and incite others"".

Cassidy is scheduled to be arraigned 15 February. He has raised more than $84,000 for his defense from nearly 2,000 supporters, according to the fundraising site GiveSendGo.

Founded in 2013, the Salem, Massachusetts-based Satanic Temple says it doesn't believe in Satan but describes itself as a ""non-theistic religious organization"" that advocates for secularism. It is separate from the Church of Satan, which was founded in the 1960s.","Michael Cassidy charged under Iowa's hate crime statute for destroying pagan idol statue.

2024-02-01,'Water comes from all four sides': how Rotterdam's tidal park protects the city,"Once a grim industrial harbour, the Keilehaven estuary acts as a natural flood barrier and wildlife sanctuary

It was once an industrial harbour, but now this small space is an entirely new kind of thing; a tidal park built to allow the river to rise and fall in the middle of the city as wildlife thrives.

The swans are already at home on the sparkling waters of the Keilehaven in Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, and other birds are quickly settling in; grebe, oystercatchers, wild ducks and kingfishers.

This, believes landscape architect Dirk van Peijpe, of architecture bureau De Urbanisten, may be a shape of things to come. ""We are increasingly working on an ecological agenda that is not only climate-sensitive but also nature-sensitive. What are we doing for city residents other than the human ones?""

The award-winning tidal park, a stone's throw from his shared offices, is one answer to that question. Once it was a typically grim industrial harbour. Now a beach of sand leads to the water, surrounded by shelves of varying heights and barriers made with tiles Rotterdammers have removed from their gardens, where indigenous plants will be seeded and left to do their thing.

""New species are emerging due to the arrival of the nature-friendly banks, like wading birds that come to forage in the silt,"" De Urbanisten's senior landscape architect Marit Janse said. ""Building tidal parks is also about the lost identity of this region as a natural estuary system ... looking for the balance between natural processes and the cultural intervention that is a park.""

This work is not a luxury. Rotterdam is a city which, like most people or places in the Netherlands, identifies itself in relation to water. It's a historical relationship; the saying goes that God created the world but the Dutch created the Netherlands, and 1930s poet Hendrik Marsman described a land where ""the sound of the water/ with its eternal disasters/ is feared and heard"".

But it's also a present and future relationship, as sea levels rise and the climate crisis is linked with more severe bouts of rainfall. ""In Rotterdam, the water comes from all four sides,"" said Van Peijpe. ""Delta cities are vulnerable to climate change, especially to sea level rises, which are happening faster than expected, but also to what comes from the rivers. There is an increase in heavy rainfall - alongside drought - and also rising groundwater, often in combination with subsidence.""

In December, Storm Pia and extreme precipitation hit: Rotterdam closed its Maeslant storm barrier for the first time to protect against storm surge while other areas piled up sandbags against unusually high water in the Maas and Rijn rivers and the IJssel and Marker lakes.

It is now explicit government policy that not just water management but also urban development is ""led by water and ground"", says floods senior specialist Dr Frans Klijn, from the Deltares institute. ""The weather is getting rougher,"" he said. ""We have been able to keep the water levels and also the groundwater levels within very tight ranges, but we now foresee that that will be impossible in future. So our water boards already say to new developers: we need more space for water storage and we need more flexibility for water level variations, more fluctuation potential, larger freeboard, so stay out of the wet areas. And we need more room for storage and discharge.""

A €2.3bn ""Room for the River"" project - making floodplains at more than 30 locations on four rivers - is credited with saving the country from the worst flooding this year. The national delta programme is investing in action to guard until 2050, and a multi-billion euro flood protection programme (HWPB) involves 100 projects to strengthen kilometres of dykes, without which, says Rijkswaterstaat infrastructure organisation, 60% of the country would regularly be under water.

But in cities, too, water protection must meet urban design to create an attractive, adaptive city, says Arnoud Molenaar, Rotterdam's chief resilience officer. A vast amount of work has been going on, and the city has built water squares, green and blue roofs and a 2km-long railway viaduct rooftop park. The water squares, also designed by De Urbanisten, are, very simply, built in overflow areas - when there is too much rainwater they fill up, and then slowly drain away so that the storm drains are not overwhelmed. And when the water has gone, they become public spaces again.

""The most important thing is that we are not investing in regret measures,"" says Molenaar. ""We are talking about transformative delta management, not adjusting things here and there. We have to talk about water safety in the context of all of the other transitions. But also, houses that are part of a waterfront have a higher value, we want a greener city, to become attractive for higher-income families, for companies. And by working in a smart way on an adaptive city, we can also increase attractiveness.""

It's an opportunity for nature too, says Niels de Zwarte, deputy director of the Natural History Museum Rotterdam: mussels and algae, fish and macrofauna could shelter under floating houses, while green facades foster plant life. ""We will have to create and design catchment areas for water in our special planning,"" he agreed. ""These are also the places where part-nature, part-recreation can have a place and where city dwellers can enjoy themselves.""

Friso de Zeeuw, TU Delft emeritus professor in spatial development, says the only danger with too much of this kind of urban planning is a loss of realism in a country that used to experience floods every year. He advocates strengthening dykes and giving rivers room but says accepting occasional minor flood damage is better than a dictatorship of new planning rules. ""We have become a bit like the princess and the pea, in that if we get a little wet we start screaming blue murder,"" he said.

But many welcome a change in the tide of urban design - certainly at Keilehaven. ""I am in love with nature projects that allow tidal effects,"" added de Zwarte. ""Almost nowhere in the world will you find a city with this tide in the river where you go from fresh to salt. That is what makes Rotterdam unique.""","Rotterdam is a city which, like most people or places in the Netherlands, identifies itself in relation to water.

2024-02-01,"Betrayal, bluegrass and Backwoods Barbie: Dolly Parton's 20 best songs - ranked!","Fifty years after Parton released the album Jolene, we assess a catalogue that spans country, Christianity and weirdly chilling ballads

There are Dolly Parton songs that deliver an emotional gut-punch, and there are Dolly Parton songs that play to her glitzy public image. Why'd You Come in Here ... is firmly in the latter category: it's lustful, funny (""you could stop traffic in a gunny sack""), insanely catchy, and overflowing with camp exuberance.

Conventional wisdom dictates that Parton only really flowered after breaking up her duet partnership with Porter Wagoner: conventional wisdom has a point, but they made some fantastic records together, not least Just Someone I Used to Know's heartsore paean to a former couple's long-lasting post-split regret.

The Parton-meets-Sylvester Stallone movie Rhinestone was a critical and commercial disaster: this song was the only thing that emerged unscathed from its wreckage, with its Bob Dylan-referencing title, get-me-out-of-New-York lyrics and a sound where Parton's Appalachian roots - complete with the occasional burst of yodelling - scratch against the slick production.

Effectively a redux of Parton's 1967 solo mission-statement Dumb Blonde, Backwoods Barbie is melodically one of her most charming contemporary songs, and lyrically among the sharpest: ""Too much makeup, too much hair / Don't be fooled by thinkin' that the goods are not all there.""

A highlight of Trio, the first album Parton recorded with Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt. The instrumentation evokes old-time Appalachia - there is a lot of autoharp - the harmonies are perfect, the lyrics curiously equivocal about the benefits, or otherwise, of leaving your home town to run wild: regret balanced by defiance.

Two Doors Down began life as a straightforward pop-country track from the Here You Come Again album. Then a cover by Zella Lehr was a hit single and Parton refigured her original into an odd, and oddly appealing, country/soul/disco hybrid. Take your pick: either version is infectiously exuberant.

The best-known of Parton's Christian-themed songs, The Seeker's brilliance lies in the way the bounciness of the rhythm and melody snags against the distinct air of spiritual desperation in the lyrics: ""I am a vessel that's empty and useless ... I am a bad seed ... you are my last hope.""

The cause of another row between Parton and Wagoner - he didn't care for the way it tacitly encouraged women to leave loveless marriages - but subsequently covered by Emmylou Harris, To Daddy is a fine example of Parton's storytelling abilities, saving its twist, and accompanying message, for the final verse, which shifts the song's mood from stoicism to liberation.

Hard for British TV viewers of a certain age to hear without automatically thinking of Wendy Craig struggling to suppress her adulterous urges in Carla Lane's sitcom Butterflies, Love Is Like a Butterfly was Parton's first No 1 after splitting from Wagoner, and understandably so: a delicate arrangement supports an entirely delightful melody.

Early solo Dolly in impressively tough-talking mood. Yes, she's been up to no good, but so has he, so stuff your moralising. Killer lines: ""When you look at me, don't feel sorry for yourself / Just think of all the shame you might have brought somebody else."" Ouch!

Parton's self-explanatorily titled The Grass Is Blue (ie ... bluegrass) garnered her best reviews in years; its follow-up might be even better. The title track, her reworking of the Appalachian folk ballad Come All You Fair and Tender Ladies, is moving and, thanks to its parched, sparse sound, weirdly chilling.

Its rhythm inspired by the sound of Parton drumming her fingernails against her guitar, 9 to 5 might be the apotheosis of her ""pop"" years, but it's a country song at heart: the lyrics are a tribute to downtrodden workers; you can imagine it stripped of its glossy production and set to acoustic guitar and pedal steel.

The glorious title track from a concept album drawing on Parton's childhood, My Tennessee Mountain Home is less concerned with depicting the poverty of her upbringing (cf In the Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad)) than celebrating its simplicity: the mood of the music follows suit, building from stark to gleefully rousing.

No one should have been surprised when Parton pivoted towards pop - her early single, 1965's Busy Signal, had as much to do with the 60s girl group sound as country - but the skill with which she did it is startling. Here You Come Again is an irresistible soft rock/pop confection.

Among her many talents, Parton is a gifted lyricist, as evidenced by the fact that the extended metaphor of The Bargain Store - a lady who has been around the block a few times compares herself to a secondhand shop - never feels grating or overdone: it is clever and, ultimately, ineffably moving.

Down from Dover's depiction of an abandoned unmarried mother giving birth to a stillborn child was controversial: Wagoner counselled Parton against releasing it. ""Lord, I can't get depressing enough, can I?"" was her chuckling assessment, but while it shovels on the misery, it is heartbreaking rather than mawkish.

Intended by the Bee Gees as a Motown-inspired duet in the style of Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, Islands in the Stream was transformed by Parton and the late Kenny Rogers: the songwriting is the Gibb brothers at the their most bulletproof, but the warmth of the vocals makes it.

Whitney Houston's globe-swallowing version remains the biggest-selling US single by a female artist, but Parton's original is something else: smaller, more personal - it was a regretful but resolute farewell to Wagoner, whose star she had long eclipsed - and, if you prefer your emotions relatable, rather than blockbuster-sized - more affecting.

The mother of all Parton tearjerkers, based on a true story: poverty-stricken mum makes young Dolly a winter coat from multicoloured rags, while telling her the Bible's story of Joseph and the coat of many colours. Schoolyard mockery ensues, but is stoically endured. Moral: ""One is poor only if they chose to be.""

Jolene doesn't tower over the rest of Parton's catalogue in terms of quality, but it is easily her most popular song, provoking hundreds of cover versions, by everyone from the White Stripes to Lil Nas X, and a succession of answer records. Perhaps that's because the emotions in the song are so believable - the desperate pleading tempered by a brief passive aggressive shrug (""whatever you decide to do, Jolene"") - or perhaps it is the melody, which somehow, bafflingly, manages to be urgent and unhurried at the same time. Or perhaps it is the simplicity: stripped-back arrangement, live feel, no bridge or middle eight, just emotional punch.","Fifty years after Parton released Jolene, we assess a catalogue of Dolly Parton songs. There are songs that deliver an emotional gut-punch, and songs that play to her glitzy public image.

2024-02-01,Trump frustrated by Haley as primaries pull focus from campaign against Biden,"Ex-president determined to see Haley withdraw from Republican race as he attempts to secure nomination as quickly as possible

Donald Trump's frustration with the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley has continued to mount, according to people close to the former president, with her refusal to withdraw from the race for the 2024 Republican nomination starting to cause operational headaches for his campaign.

Trump was annoyed with Haley the night of his New Hampshire primary win last week after she finished in second place and still delivered a speech that he viewed as her taking a victory lap.

But Trump's personal frustration has turned darker with the reality that Haley's persistence means he will have to campaign more aggressively for the South Carolina primary, diverting resources away from preparing for a general election against Joe Biden, the people said.

The animosity towards Haley could precipitate an uglier fight in the weeks ahead as Trump becomes more determined to see her exit, talking about her in more vitriolic terms while attempting to dominate the next early voting states to secure the nomination as quickly as possible.

On primary night in New Hampshire, Trump appeared to be in genuine disbelief that Haley decided not to withdraw and instead spun her defeat - slightly closer than predicted in the polls, but nonetheless overwhelming - in her speech that night as an unexpected win.

The move caught Trump off guard because he thought Haley would fold, similar to the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, who dropped out and endorsed him after his second-place finish in Iowa the week before, the people said. Trump took Haley's effervescent defiance personally.

""I said, 'Wow, she's doing like a speech, like she won,'"" Trump complained in his speech after the New Hampshire results were released. ""Who the hell was the impostor that went up on the stage before and, like, claimed a victory? She did very poorly, actually.""

The frustration has grown more acute as the Trump campaign gears up for the next several contests before Super Tuesday, when 15 states are scheduled to hold Republican primaries or caucuses, at which point he hopes to have secured enough delegates to be the nominee, the people said.

In recent days, it has become clear to Trump that he may need to take multiple trips to South Carolina to battle the Haley campaign, which he appears to view as a waste of time given that internal and public polling shows almost no path for Haley to beat out Trump.

The more time and resources Trump has to spend fighting Haley, his team has suggested, the more they cannot focus on pivoting to the general election to target Biden and respond to his political attacks.

Haley has described herself as ""scrappy"" and continues to hold rallies during which her denunciations of Trump have become increasingly hostile. And, last Wednesday, Haley launched a $4m advertising campaign in South Carolina calling a Biden v Trump election as ""a rematch no one wants"".

The narrator in the TV ad says: ""Biden - too old. Trump - too much chaos. There's a better choice for a better America.""

A Trump spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment.

Broadly, Trump also views Haley as one more thing he should not have to deal with but is forced to as long as she remains in the race, the people said. Trump has multiple priorities pulling him in different directions these days, most notably his legal problems.

Even with the second defamation case brought against him by E Jean Carroll now concluded, Trump has spent increasing amounts of time focused on the multiple criminal cases he is facing. Trump had hoped a big win in New Hampshire meant Haley could be one less issue to deal with.

Underscoring Trump's irritation with the Haley situation is what he sees as a betrayal from Haley, the people said. In at least one recent conversation with allies, Trump slammed her for not withdrawing, using an epithet pejorative to women while describing her perceived disloyalty.","Trump's frustration with Nikki Haley continues to mount, according to people close to the former president.

2024-02-01,Escaped monkey found snacking on peanuts in Highlands garden,"Japanese macaque caught on bird feeder four days after disappearing from wildlife park

A monkey that escaped from a wildlife park in the Highlands has been found snacking on peanuts after an intensive four-day search.

A member of the public alerted searchers after spotting the Japanese macaque eating legumes left out for the birds in their garden on Thursday morning.

Keith Gilchrist, the living collections operations manager at Highland Wildlife Park who was coordinating the search, described his ""huge relief"" that the search was over. The monkey was shot with a tranquiliser dart and taken to the park to be checked by a vet before being reunited with his troop later.

""We're so happy that he's back and safe,"" Gilchrist said. ""In the end the bird feeder saved the day. In the open country it's so difficult to get a dart into him but we knew if he was in the right spot at the right time we'd be able to get him,"" he said.

Gilchrist said the animal appeared to be in reasonably good condition after four nights in the wild.

He was found 1.4 miles from the park, in Kincraig, having been sighted 300 metres from the entrance on Tuesday evening.

The missing macaque has become a global celebrity since disappearing on Sunday, with coverage of his solo adventure appearing around the world.

Gilchrist said: ""The amount of attention it's garnered, it would be nice if those people stuck with us and saw the conservation work we do around the globe and locally in Scotland.""",Japanese macaque found snacking on peanuts after four-day search. the monkey escaped from a wildlife park in the Highlands on Sunday. he was shot with a tranquiliser dart and taken to the park to be checked by a vet.,"[('macaque', 0.5033), ('monkey', 0.4942), ('peanuts', 0.3922), ('wildlife', 0.3008), ('snacking', 0.249), ('escaped', 0.2304), ('japanese', 0.1897), ('park', 0.185), ('shot', 0.1426), ('search', 0.121)]","macaque, monkey, peanuts, wildlife, snacking, escaped, japanese, park, shot, search",95
2024-02-01,Of course Nicola Sturgeon cried at the Covid inquiry - her fatal flaws have been exposed | Dani Garavelli,"From shocking levels of secrecy to control-freakery, her handling of the pandemic speaks to serious problems with her leadership

When Nicola Sturgeon broke down at the UK Covid inquiry she was accused of shedding crocodile tears. They looked real enough to me, induced by having her motives impugned and of watching what was left of her legacy leach away under Jamie Dawson KC's questioning.

The former first minister was willing to admit to errors of judgment. What she could not accept was that she had ever acted in anything other than what she believed to be the best interests of the people of Scotland.

This may be true. Sturgeon has long worn the air of a Sunday school teacher driven by civic duty and a compulsion to take the burdens of the world on her shoulders. But what her appearance in front of the inquiry exposed was the hubris that underpins that sense of moral purpose. Sturgeon was convinced that she, and she alone, was capable of effective decision-making. Her sleepless nights were less a testament to her dedication than evidence of an inability to delegate, which was the hallmark of her leadership and the opposite of good governance.

Sturgeon's control freakery was visible in the setting up of ""gold command"" meetings to which only a chosen few were invited. This clique did not, in 2020, include the finance secretary, Kate Forbes, even when the economic impact of a potential circuit breaker was under discussion.

It was visible, too, in the deletion of her WhatsApp messages. Sturgeon, we know, called Boris Johnson ""a fucking clown"", a sentiment few north of the border would disagree with. But for all their differences, she and her English counterpart had in common an unwavering confidence in their own judgment. Sturgeon told Dawson it did not matter that the inquiry could not scrutinise her messages because all the ""salient"" information had been transferred to the ""corporate record"". But the question of salience is subjective. So, too, are the parameters of the decision-making process. Some of the WhatsApp messages retrieved from other sources have shed light on the power dynamics that formed the backdrop to decision-making. We will never find out what the others might have revealed.

That the Scottish government had an issue with transparency is not news to anyone who has struggled to retrieve information through a freedom of information request; or who followed the parliamentary inquiry into the handling of harassment complaints against Alex Salmond, when it had to be pushed to hand over documents.

The Covid inquiry suggests the pandemic consolidated that culture. Indeed, if the jokey exchanges between Ken ""plausible deniability"" Thomson, the Scottish government's then director general for strategy and external affairs, and Jason Leitch, Scotland's national clinical director, are anything to go by, it was a source of amusement. When Thomson wrote, in a WhatsApp message seen by the inquiry, ""The information you requested is not held centrally,"" he was sending up the stock phrase used to keep details out of the public domain.

Sturgeon dismissed the conversation as a ""lighthearted"" discussion. But what about the fact that the ""gold command"" meetings were not minuted? Questioned by Dawson, Sturgeon denied these meetings were a means of bypassing cabinet. But without a paper trail, who can tell?

Sturgeon's secrecy is doubly shocking when set against the apparent spirit of openness in which her public briefings were conducted. Day after day, she stood at her St Andrew's House podium and set out her government's thinking. Her clarity contrasted favourably with Johnson's incoherence, and her approval ratings soared. Yet at the point when she promised the Channel 4 journalist Ciaran Jenkins that she would hand over all her WhatsApp messages to future inquiries, she had already deleted them. No wonder the bereaved feel betrayed.

Less convincing were Dawson's attempts to show that Sturgeon had used the pandemic to advance the cause of independence. When he cast her divergence from UK policy as political grandstanding, she pointed out the UK government was often the outlier, with the three devolved nations aligned. When he accused her of ""jumping the gun"" by announcing a ban on mass gatherings before Johnson, she insisted her only regret was that she hadn't done it sooner.

Dawson wasn't for quitting. He asked Sturgeon about minutes that recorded the cabinet agreeing that ""consideration should be given to restarting work on independence"". She said maybe so, but that work had not, in fact, restarted. He showed her an email in which the former deputy first minister John Swinney appeared to suggest failing to relax quarantine rules for those returning from Spain might lead Spain to block Scotland's entry to the EU in the event of independence. This argument was so bizarre it was difficult to believe Swinney would ever have advanced it. And sure enough, the Scottish government later claimed it had been written by a civil servant.

On and on Dawson went until the interrogation itself began to feel politicised. He didn't touch on one of the most urgent issues: the release of untested hospital patients into care homes. That was left to Kevin McCaffrey, representing the Scottish Covid Bereaved Group. Sturgeon answered as best she could, which is to say inadequately. Still, how difficult it must have been, in those early stages, to chart a course through all the conflicting evidence and advice. And how difficult - four years later - to have to account for your decisions in an adversarial process that sometimes seemed less interested in learning lessons than in bringing politicians down.

There is no excuse for Sturgeon's ""industrial-scale"" WhatsApp deletion, but it was still possible to empathise with her when she said - through tears - that she sometimes wished she hadn't been first minister when Covid struck. Not long ago it seemed her handling of the crisis would be the crowning moment of a glittering political career. But if there's one thing this inquiry has demonstrated, it's that leading the country through the pandemic was an impossible task, with nothing but ignominy at the end of it.",Nicola Sturgeon was accused of shedding crocodile tears at the UK Covid inquiry.

2024-02-01,'All at sea': Alastair Cook says Sharma and India were baffled by positive England,"'They weren't sure where to turn or what to do'Former England captain praises Hartley's resilience

Alastair Cook has said Rohit Sharma, the India captain, appeared to have no idea how to counteract England's positive play during the first Test. As a result, Cook believes, the players ""didn't really know where to turn or who to look at"" and were ""all at sea"" as they fell to a stunning 28-run defeat.

Cook, speaking before his role fronting TNT Sports' cricket coverage, captained England in 59 Tests - only Joe Root has played more Tests as captain - including during their series win in India, the last by any touring side, in 2012. ""It was probably one of the greatest away wins, or wins anywhere considering where they found themselves at the end of day two,"" he said of England's performance in the opening Test.

""They found themselves with a free shot at the end of day two, where they were in a position where you don't win too many games of cricket. It almost freed them up and allowed them to play.

""I said before the series it would be very interesting to see how India cope with the willingness to attack spin that the England batsmen will show. We knew it was going to happen and it is confrontational as a captain because there's not much you can do.

""Halfway through day three they weren't sure where to turn or what to do. That's what it [England's Bazball approach] can do. What we saw - and whether that was because Virat Kohli wasn't there - with a bit of inexperience in their middle-order and in the field, they didn't really know where to turn to or who to look at. Either for how do we chase in that fourth innings or how are we going to stop this England onslaught. They did look a little bit all at sea.""

Cook said Sharma had been particularly slow to counteract England's tactics, particularly as Ollie Pope scored his epic 196 on the third and fourth days. ""They're so used to winning games, they [thought], 'This won't happen for much longer.' When Ollie Pope kept playing the reverse sweep, Rohit didn't change the field for a while because he thought, well, stats say that if you play a high-risk shot against world-class bowling, the odds are stacked in [the bowlers'] favour.

""But the English batsmen continued executing the shots really well, then they had to blink. By the time they blinked, they'd missed the [boat],"" Cook said. ""It's going to be intriguing to see what India do. Whether England have forced their hand and they become more defensive in their field placings, and therefore the traditional way of getting out to spin - caught bat-pad, caught silly point, playing defensively - England might have taken that away because they might have less men around the bat.""

England's highest wicket-takers in 2012 were the spinners Graeme Swann and Monty Panesar, who went into the series with 46 and 42 Test caps respectively. With the exception of Jack Leach, who has been ruled out of the second Test, England's specialist spinners on this tour have much less experience: Tom Hartley made his debut in Hyderabad, Rehan Ahmed has two Test caps and Shoaib Hashir none.

""Monty and Swanny were outstanding that series, they outbowled the Indian spinners by quite a long way,"" Cook said. ""It was quite easy to captain - you just throw the ball to them.""

Cook admitted he would probably have taken Hartley out of the attack when India were scoring freely against him on the first day, but was impressed by the 24-year-old's strength of character as he battled back to take seven wickets in the second innings. ""You don't know what would have happened either way. What we do know is that Hartley's got something about him to be able to bowl in the second innings under pressure. I don't think that's just down to Stokesy's captaincy, that's down to Hartley and his mental stamina and stomach for the fight.""

""A lot of credit has to be given to him for mentally being able to handle the onslaught and then coming out to deliver the goods. England might have found a cricketer who is good under pressure and that's ultimately what Test cricket is about.""","Alastair Cook says India captain Rohit Sharma appeared to have no idea how to counteract England's positive play during the first Test.

2024-02-01,Caitlin Clark scores 35 to reach No 2 on NCAA's all-time scoring list,"Iowa star now just 103 points behind Kelsey PlumGuard has been limited to single digits just once

Caitlin Clark cruised right by Jackie Stiles and Kelsey Mitchell. Next up is Kelsey Plum. That's the only name above Clark on the NCAA women's basketball scoring list.

Clark collected 35 points, 10 assists and six rebounds in front of a sellout crowd at Welsh-Ryan Arena, leading Iowa to a 110-74 victory over Northwestern on Wednesday night.

Three weeks after passing Brittney Griner, Clark took down two more big names in women's hoops. She passed Stiles for third on the NCAA list when she made a three-pointer in the first quarter. She moved ahead of Ohio State's Mitchell when she converted a layup with 4:58 left in the first half, making her the career scoring leader for the Big Ten.

Clark finished the night with 3,424 points, departing to a big ovation with 4:23 remaining. Plum, who starred at Washington from 2013-17, tops the women's Division I scoring list with 3,527 points.

""I think the coolest thing is just the names that I get to be around,"" Clark said. ""Those are people that I grew up watching, especially Kelsey Plum, Brittney Griner, Kelsey Mitchell. Those are really, really great players.""

Cheered on by a crowd of 7,039 filled with Iowa colors and dotted with Clark shirts, the senior guard went 11 for 22 from the field and 10 for 10 at the free-throw line. It was her 13th game this season with at least 30 points.

But it was her passing that really stood out. She made a nice pass ahead to Hannah Stuelke for a fast-break layup in the second quarter, and she found Sydney Affolter for a backdoor layup in the third.

""This was one that was definitely circled on my calendar, just because I know the amount of Iowa fans in the Chicago area,"" Clark said. ""So I was super excited to come here. I love this gym.""

2024-02-01,'I don't buy it': Scottish secretary dismisses Sturgeon's Covid inquiry tears,"Alister Jack suggests former first minister was insincere during her emotional daylong testimony

The Scotland secretary has dismissed Nicola Sturgeon's raw emotions during her evidence to the Covid inquiry as insincere and false.

""I thought she could cry with one eye if she wanted to,"" Alister Jack told the inquiry on Thursday, as he acknowledged there were deep levels of distrust between him and senior Scottish government ministers.

Sturgeon's eyes filled with tears and her voice broke a number of times during her daylong testimony to the inquiry in Edinburgh on Wednesday, as she recounted how ""incredibly stressful"" she found it dealing with the ""horrendous"" effects of the pandemic.

Jack said his long experience of dealing with the then first minister made him extremely sceptical about the authenticity of her emotions. ""I don't buy it for a minute,"" he told Jamie Dawson KC, the inquiry's Scottish counsel.

He said tensions between the UK and Scottish administrations heightened on 12 March after Sturgeon announced a ban in Scotland of mass gatherings of more than 500 people, before the UK's other governments had verified the plan.

Jack alleged the Scottish government kept secret its knowledge of a significant Covid outbreak linked to a Nike conference in Edinburgh in February, where 36 people were infected.

He said Jack and Matt Hancock had met Jeane Freeman, who at the time was Scotland's health secretary, on the evening of 12 March, after Sturgeon's statement on large gatherings. Freeman did not mention the Nike outbreak; Hancock first learned of it when news of it leaked later that summer.

Michael Gove, then a senior UK cabinet minister, told the inquiry on Monday that Sturgeon had ""jumped the gun"" by disclosing the ban first. Jack said her announcement also ""breached confidentiality"" because she revealed it was about to be discussed by Cobra, the UK government's emergency committee.

Jack was challenged by Dawson on whether the UK government was also secretive about its thinking and policy decisions, including plans by Rishi Sunak, the then chancellor, for the ""eat out to help out"" financial plan for restaurants. Jack confirmed he did not brief Sturgeon's officials about the proposal.

As an MP for a Scottish seat close to the English border, he said policy differences during Covid, on travel restrictions and local lockdowns, were ""quite frustrating"". He accepted devolution existed but would rather all parts of the UK were aligned.

""I thought the whole border thing was trying to appear that Scotland was a different country, a world apart,"" he said.

Dawson said the antipathy appeared to be personal. John Swinney, then Sturgeon's deputy first minister, told the inquiry he could not tolerate Jack because of Jack's behaviour before the pandemic. By contrast, Swinney said, the Scottish government got on very well with Jack's predecessor, David Mundell.

Jack agreed he had a poor relationship with Scottish ministers: he had taken four legal challenges against them over Scottish government policies. ""Those tensions existed before the pandemic, during the pandemic and exist now today,"" he said.

Dawson pressed the Scottish secretary over why he deleted all his WhatsApp messages - a recurrent theme during the inquiry. Jack said he had to wipe his messages because in the first half of the pandemic he had a basic mobile with only 16GB of memory.

He was advised to wipe all his WhatsApps, from his wife, his family, friends and colleagues, to allow the phone to work properly. He said he did not do government business by WhatsApp. ""At the time, I didn't think anything of it,"" he said.","Alister Jack dismisses Nicola Sturgeon's raw emotions during her daylong testimony.

2024-02-01,"UK interest rates have peaked, the next move is down ... but not yet","Bank of England's rate-setting panel is split three ways - to hike, cut or hold -but analysts are now pencilling in a cut for late spring

Interest rates have peaked. The next move in borrowing costs will be down. But not yet. Those were the three key messages from the Bank of England in its latest assessment of the state of the economy.

Those conclusions may not be immediately apparent from the minutes of the latest meeting on Threadneedle Street of the monetary policy committee (MPC) - the body tasked with setting interest rates to hit the government's 2% inflation target - because the MPC had a three-way split.

Six members voted to keep interest rates unchanged at 5.25%, two voted for them to rise to 5.5% while one voted for a reduction to 5%.

It is rare for the Bank to be this divided, and in theory rates could still rise further. Interestingly, the last time there was a similar difference of opinion was in August 2008, the month before the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers ushered in the most turbulent phase of the global financial crisis. Rates were subsequently cut aggressively.

A repeat of the rapid easing of policy seen in 2008 is not on the cards right now, but the financial markets will read the runes. Assuming the economy pans out according to the Bank's forecasts, the City will be pencilling in a cut in rates in late spring.

In November last year, the MPC said it stood ready to raise interest rates should inflationary pressure prove more persistent. In fact, there has been better news on inflation and that language has now been dropped.

What's more, the Bank's forecasts show that leaving rates at 5.25% would push the UK into a two-year recession lasting until the end of 2025 and for inflation to be well below its 2% target. Given those projections, it would be a little strange for the Bank to pretend that no discussions were taking place on the possibility of rate cuts.

On the other hand, the fact that inflation peaked at more than 11% and has taken time to come down inevitably makes the Bank cautious about easing policy too quickly. The MPC is particularly focused on the level of pay settlements and inflation in the service sector - both of which are seen as good bellwethers of underlying price pressures.

Andrew Bailey, the Bank's governor, voiced the view of the no-change majority when he said more ""good news"" on inflation was required for rates to be cut.

The Bank has been surprised by the extent to which price pressures have eased in recent months and it now believes lower energy prices will bring inflation temporarily back to its 2% target by May. But it then thinks it will rise again to 2.75% by the end of the year. ""We need to see more evidence that inflation is set to fall all the way to the 2%, and stay there, before we can lower interest rates,"" Bailey said.

2024-02-01,Dining across the divide: 'We have to get over the public school obsession that Britain is something great',"One is happy the UK left the EU, the other thinks Brexit only empowered the wealthy elite. Guess which one reckons the climate crisis is solvable?

Voting record Usually Green or for an independent candidate, though has voted Conservative

Amuse bouche Campaigned in favour of Brexit in Frome. Everyone thought he was a Tory, but in fact, he'd been a member of the Green party since it was called the Ecology party (1985)

Occupation Barrister and mediator

Voting record Labour voter and sometime member. Left when Blair went into Iraq; rejoined when Corbyn became leader; left again when Starmer took over

Alistair My first impression was he's slightly alternative. He's a self-made person, his political stances have been shaped by his experiences in the IT world. He's voted all around the shop. Why the hell would you vote for Ukip?

Tony I'm not even sure that I did vote Ukip, now. I just know I would have if there'd been a candidate ... The food was nice: Turkish, too much of it.

Alistair I started off with an aubergine salad. Then they put this chef's platter in the middle of us, an overwhelming amount of food.

Tony I voted leave, and Alistair was a firm remainer. I don't think it's delivered a great deal, but we only left two years ago. We were a member of the EU for many decades, so it will take time to find our feet and reap the benefits. Democracy is the big one and everything else follows from that. We both agreed the EU is not a democratic institution; it surprised me he would agree with me on that, but his take was that the UK isn't democratic either, which doesn't really take us anywhere.

Alistair He seemed to think that bringing power back to Britain was somehow going to empower us, but empower who? All it's going to empower is the super-wealthy elite. He probably thinks I'm a conspiracy theorist, but I'm not. I think there was an agenda - the super-wealthy didn't want to be restrained by new financial constraints brought in by the EU. It was sold to us as a pack of lies to the credulous British public, a referendum on immigration, which it was not.

Tony People are starting to get the idea that we're running our own country now and the buck stops with the prime minister. The result will be a more dynamic and happy nation.

Alistair We're just a struggling little country that's diminishing in the eyes of the world. We have to get over the public school obsession that Britain is something great.

Tony Alistair is very gloomy; his view is that we're basically doomed, we're going to destroy the environment. He thinks the planet will carry on but we're screwed. If I thought like that, I'd be a very miserable person; I don't know how he remains chirpy and cheerful.

Alistair We discussed climate change at length. To me nobody seems to be taking it seriously. Although he recognises that it's a major issue, he has this blind faith that humanity will stop at the edge of the cliff and solve the problem with technology.

Tony I think we are saving ourselves already: a decade ago there was very little in the way of solar and wind power, and now it's contributing 40-50% of our electricity.

Alistair Renewables was one point of agreement. But he still believes in economic growth and I don't. I see it as analogous to a giant tumour. I'm filled with despair about the planet's future, whereas he's filled with optimism.

Tony The magic money tree was a fundamental difference. How can you just keep borrowing more money? You've got to pay interest on what you borrow. Eventually people will get the idea that the UK can't pay its debts and they won't lend to us any more.

Alistair I painted what I believe to be the truth: austerity is just a neoliberal ideology that's destroyed our public services. He wasn't on board with that at all, he favours what I regard as the incredibly naive Thatcherite doctrine: that balancing the books of an economy is the same as balancing the books in a household.

Tony We exchanged numbers and said, ""Let's get together sometime."" You could say we hit it off.","Usually Green or for an independent candidate, though has voted Conservative Amuse bouche.

2024-02-01,Tired and divided: how Yorkshire fans view the likely return of Colin Graves,"Supporters of the county cricket club are nervous about the former chairman's takeover, expected to be sealed on Friday

It isn't often that Yorkshire men and women bite their tongues when it comes to cricket. But the tumult of the last few years, Azeem Rafiq's revelations of what the CDC called ""a culture of discrimination"" at Headingley, the unfair dismissal of 16 members of staff, the docking of Championship points, the heightened emotions, the cruelty of the online spats, and the money troubles, oh the money troubles, have all had an effect.

Now a saviour has arrived, looking very much like the old saviour, Colin Graves, he of the rescue bid in 2002, and the club chair from 2007 to 2015. The club are heavily in Graves' debt, and he has offered once again to ride to the rescue - with an instant £1m injection and another £4m over a five-month period - so long as members vote him in as chair at the EGM at Headingley on Friday morning.

The current board have recommended that members accept the Graves consortium, and the hints are that the postal votes are heavily in his favour. But how to take the temperature among supporters during this wet winter? The Yorkshire Supporters Association are tight lipped. The Sheffield Cricket Lovers Society are very charming but regretfully decline. There is no-one available at Yorkshire CCC or at Bradford Park Avenue. It is hard to blame them.

Of those who are prepared to speak, some, of all stripes, don't want to give their names for fear of reprisals.

One resigned his sponsorship and membership after the mass cull of the coaching staff in December 2021. ""Personally, I am in favour of Colin Graves returning because a simple look at the club's finances leaves the members no choice, and Colin is the logical solution for that. Can he run a cricket club? Absolutely. Is there a club without Colin? Probably not.

""In relation to racism and what happened under Colin's tenure, there appears to be no evidence to suggest he was party to it, but we need to move forward. Colin is a pragmatic, successful businessman. I'm sure he will continue to develop any improvements that the club may have made about EDI and community inclusion.""

The same person said Rafiq had apologised for sending anti-semitic messages to another player. ""That apology has been widely accepted as sincere and genuine. Why then is Colin's apology [for describing dressing-room abuse as ""banter""] not deemed to be the same?""

Another ex-member, of British Asian heritage, shares the desire for anonymity, but has a different take on Graves' possible return.

""Headingley was a safe place to be in the 1980s when Leeds United definitely wasn't for anyone brown or black. I had many happy memories, though you'd hear the P word, the N word sometimes, and the Western Terrace was, and perhaps still is, racist.

""I'm sure Colin Graves is a great businessman but when he said he's never seen any racism at Yorkshire, I really worry about that. Michael Holding, Malcolm Marshall and many thousands of non-white supporters would have a different view.

""If he is the only solution, we need transparency. There were 350 bids? And none of them were viable? For me his return sends a real message that Yorkshire is returning to type. I love Yorkshire CC, I don't want it to die, but it's complicated.

""A lot of people are exhausted by this and want to move forward in a positive way. If Graves returns straight away as chair, the message for the Muslim community, the Asian community, the black community and many of the membership is a poor one. If Colin Graves is the answer, what exactly is the question.""

James Greenfield, the chair of the Wombwell society and committee member of the Northern Cricket society, has been a Yorkshire member since 1971. His take is a pragmatic one.

""We know there has been lots of turbulence in the history of Yorkshire cricket, but this has been the most terrifying crisis of all. This is the time when we really feared possible extinction and going into administration, and there didn't seem to be any way out - except that I for one never believed that Colin Graves would disappear from the scene.

""Certain people said we must not look back but I've never understood that. I don't claim to know Colin Graves at all well, but to have invested all the money that he has in Yorkshire CCC he has to be a cricket nut - otherwise there must be better ways to invest that money.""

But for Chris Marshall, another longtime fan and past member, the return of Graves doesn't work from either a business or club cohesion perspective.

""I think there is a feeling of resignation. Too many people have bought the sob story that there is nobody better than Colin Graves - well I'm sorry but if that's the truth then the board aren't very good. If it is true that they've looked at 350 enquiries and the best they can get is someone who genuinely benefits if Yorkshire goes bust ...I've got a pretty strong business background and there are lots of businesses that are saved at the last minute.

""Yorkshire is like a little castle, with everyone worried about defending the moat rather than worrying about what is happening in the castle. But there can't be any logic in saying that if you bring back someone who is incredibly divisive, it is going to bring peace. The club is just going to remain a warring faction.""

On Friday morning, yet another act opens in this endless internecine drama.","Supporters of Yorkshire CCC are nervous about the former chairman's takeover.

2024-02-01,'We learn from each other' - how Ghana's Black Queens turned fortunes around,"The team were not in great shape before Nora Hauptle took over in January 2023. Now they dream of Wafcon glory

In the end Nora Hauptle could not hold back her tears. They were tears of joy. Even for a woman who has played and managed at the highest level, what she had just achieved with Ghana had to be filed under her greatest achievements.

The Black Queens, as Ghana's women's national team are nicknamed, had just lost 1-0 in Namibia but the result had very little significance because their 3-1 victory in the first leg four days before meant they had qualified for the 2024 Women's Africa Cup of Nations (Wafcon) - their first major tournament in six years.

As Hauptle, the entire technical staff and players celebrated, waving back at the singing Ghana supporters in the stands and taking it all in, it epitomised their journey to achieve this remarkable feat. They've made it look so easy with a string of victories but it has been everything but.

A year ago this was a team unrecognisable from the one that qualified: fragile and without an identity. Now, they do not just play with swagger but have made a habit of winning games comfortably.

""I'm very happy to be part of the squad that qualified [for the Wafcon] and also very proud of the team,"" the midfielder Ernestina Abambila, who plays for the Turkish top-flight side Hakkarigucu Spor Kulubu, tells Moving the Goalposts. ""The last time the Black Queens qualified was in 2018, which was hosted by Ghana, so returning to the Wafcon feels great.""

Abambila's sentiments are shared by most of the players. It does not seem to matter whether they start, come on or do not get any minutes at all; they're usually just eager to contribute when given the opportunity. And there is now a competitiveness that means no one can take a call-up for granted.

Under Hauptle, the Black Queens train with gravitas and play with a twinkle. The Swiss coach, thanks to her impeccable person-management skills, has created a team culture that has every player on the same page. ""She has time for every player,"" says Abambila. ""I have learned a lot of things on and off the pitch since I started working with her in the national team.""

When Hauptle took charge in January 2023 she initiated a rejuvenation of the squad, phasing out the old guard and developing a new core mainly made up of players promoted from the Under-20s. This has led to consistent results - the Black Queens have won 10 out of 11 matches under her, scoring 34 goals, conceding two and keeping nine clean sheets - and are able to control games, create a lot of chances and fight on when things aren't going their way.

The refreshing part is that Hauptle learns from her players as much as she teaches them. The 40-year-old is aware of the cultural gap between Europe, where she was born and raised, and Ghana and makes a big effort to assimilate.

""I teach them discipline, but they always tell me that they like that we are strict and demanding,"" Hauptle tells Moving the Goalposts. ""On the other side they have an approach which I learn a lot from too. The relaxed way, for example, when they dance and sing before a game, I can learn a lot from that. And they sometimes smile when they see that their coach is not in the rhythm.""

Women's football in Ghana has been through a bad spell. It beggars belief that, despite being one of the pioneers of the women's game in Africa, Ghana have yet to win a major tournament at senior level.

Between 1991 and 2006, Ghana always made the Wafcon quarter-finals at least, finishing runners-up on three occasions. However, the Black Queens have since exited the tournament at the group stage four times and failed to qualify twice.

Ghana, previously bettered only by Nigeria on the continent, have fallen behind countries such as Cameroon, Morocco, South Africa and the the Democratic Republic of the Congo and last qualified for the World Cup in 2007.

The country continues to produce exceptional female players, most of whom are now being noticed by elite clubs in Europe. The biggest bane of the women's game has been a dearth of investment. Many players in the Ghana Women's Premier League play for free despite the harsh economic conditions in the country, and the situation is no different for many players who represent the various women's national teams. It is a far cry from the men's game, where millions of dollars are pushed into the Black Stars.

The Black Queens have enjoyed an exceptional 2023 but expectations are now very high. They will be back in action in February for a two-leg final Olympic qualifier against Zambia before flying to Morocco in August aiming to win a first Wafcon title.

Hauptle believes there is no limit to what this talented group can achieve but they must be wary of complacency. Abambila agrees with her coach, saying: ""Our first target is to qualify from the group stage [of the Wafcon]. Then we take it from there.""

Champions League: The final round of group games included a spectacular 4-4 draw between Benfica and Barcelona and when the dust had settled the Swedish side Häcken went through at the expense of Paris FC and Real Madrid, and Ajax finished ahead of Bayern Munich and Roma in their section. The quarter-final and semi-final draw is on Tuesday.

But for me this felt like a good opportunity at the right time to hopefully play a bigger, more consistent role for a club, and a good step for me to continue to grow my game"" - Jessie Fleming after joining NWSL side Portland Thorns.

2024-02-01,Greta Thunberg goes on trial over London oil industry protests,"Swedish climate campaigner among five arrested outside conference for oil bosses and government ministers

Greta Thunberg has appeared in court in London in a trial over a protest outside an oil industry summit in the capital last year.

The Swedish climate campaigner was one of five activists at Westminster magistrates court charged with ""failing to comply with a condition imposed under section 14 of the Public Order Act"" after they were told to leave the area.

With her in the dock were Christofer Kebbon, Joshua James Unwin, Jeff Rice and Peter Baker, all supporters of the climate activist groups Fossil Free London or Greenpeace. They face fines of up to £2,500 if found guilty.

They were arrested after taking part in protests last October blocking the entrances of the InterContinental hotel in Mayfair, the venue for the Energy Intelligence Forum (EIF) attended by fossil fuel executives and government ministers.

Critics called the event the ""oily money conference"" in a sardonic nod to its previous name, the Oil and Money conference. The chief executives of Aramco, Repsol, Shell, TotalEnergies and the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, were among the people lined up to speak and to hand out awards, including ""energy executive of the year"".

Luke Staton, prosecuting, described the moment Thunberg was arrested. ""Miss Thunberg was stood outside the hotel entrance,"" he said. ""She was approached at around 1.12pm by [two police officers who] informed her of the condition and warned her that failure to comply would lead to her arrest.

""She said she was staying where she was, and she was arrested at 1.15pm.""

The arrests were made after Suella Braverman, the then home secretary, used a statutory instrument to lower the threshold at which police could enforce public order restrictions on protests to anything causing ""more than minor"" disruption.

On Thursday morning, climate activists protested outside the court in solidarity with those on trial, holding placards saying: ""Climate protest is not a crime"" and ""Who are the real criminals?""

Joanna Warrington, an organiser with Fossil Free London, said: ""The UK criminalises peaceful climate activists like Greta whilst rolling out the red carpet for climate criminals in Mayfair hotels.

""Fossil fuel corporations are most responsible for the climate crisis, and we will continue to hold them to account no matter what the state throws at us. We have to, because nothing is worse than losing everything.""","Greta Thunberg appeared in court in London in a trial over a protest outside an oil industry summit.

2024-02-01,"Transfer latest: Aston Villa seal Rogers signing, Forest land striker Ribeiro","Brighton midfielder Mahmoud Dahoud goes to Stuttgart on loan

Aston Villa have completed their move for the Middlesbrough forward Morgan Rogers after a concerted January pursuit. The 21-year-old, who arrived at Boro from Manchester City last July, has joined the Premier League club for a fee which it is understood could reach about £16m.

Rogers scored seven goals in 33 appearances for Boro, the most recent in last week's Carabao Cup semi-final second leg defeat at Chelsea, and has been the subject of prolonged interest from Villa.

Boro resisted Villa's early overtures for a player who began his professional career at West Brom and had loans at Lincoln, Blackpool and Bournemouth during his time with City, but finally settled for a healthy return on a player who cost them about £1m. City stand to benefit from a sell-on clause.

Nottingham Forest and Brighton also made early moves in an otherwise sedate start to transfer deadline day. Forest signed Rodrigo Ribeiro from Sporting, the 18-year-old striker joining on loan until the end of the season in a deal that could become permanent.

2024-02-01,A bastion of liberal Britain is in trouble. But Labour has a chance to revive Channel 4's radical spirit | Leo Watkins,"A different way of funding the broadcaster would give it more security - and help it make bolder programmes, too

Channel 4 has just announced plans to cut almost 250 jobs (about 15% of its workforce of full-time staff), sell its London HQ and drop a number of shows.

The immediate cause of its problems is the ad market. Channel 4 depends on advertising for about 90% of its revenue, and ad spending was cut back in 2023 as consumer spending was squeezed. But the station's problems run deeper. A decade ago, TV accounted for almost half of the display ad spending in the UK, and online about an eighth. Today, online is more than half and TV is about a quarter. First the internet swallowed print advertising, now it's coming for TV.

The shift is being driven by viewing moving online, as young people in particular spend more time using video-sharing platforms such as YouTube, and subscription on-demand services such as Netflix. Live TV viewing fell from 60% of overall viewing in 2017 to 45% in 2022. Channel 4 has always sought a younger audience, yet live TV represents only 16% of the viewing of those between 16 and 34, compared to 36% five years ago.

To combat the problem, Channel 4's leadership have announced Fast Forward, a strategy to become a ""genuinely digital-first public service streamer by 2030"". But it faces an unenviable challenge: competing for digital ad revenue with Google and Meta, whose scale and capabilities are far beyond UK broadcasters, and competing for subscribers in an increasingly crowded streaming market with Netflix, Amazon, Apple and Disney, whose content budgets dwarf Channel 4's.

But even if tech companies weren't increasingly dominating the ad market, advertising is still the wrong way to fund Channel 4. There has always been a basic contradiction between the channel's reliance on advertising and its public service remit, which requires it to champion unheard voices, innovate and take risks, contribute to citizenship and debate, promote diversity across the UK, appeal particularly to young people, and make films. But the need to make ad revenue pushes it in totally the opposite direction: towards commissioning programmes - reality TV, gameshows and other cheaper formats - that will reliably deliver high ratings at a low cost per viewer. Ideally, these shows will also be ones generic enough to be licensed internationally, such as First Dates, Come Dine With Me and Gogglebox.

Worse, advertising can have a censoring effect: biasing commissioning towards programmes that attract the viewers advertisers care most about (typically the ""upmarket"" ones with higher incomes), and away from genres or topics less likely to promote a ""consuming"" mood in the viewer. This leads to a situation where the revenue generated by more commercial shows - Big Brother, Deal Or No Deal, The Great British Bake Off - cross-subsidises remit-focused work, like Chewing Gum, Big Boys, Miners' Strike 1984, Channel 4 News and Film4.

The trade-off was much more favourable to the remit in the 1980s, when ITV and Channel 4 advertising was sold together as a monopoly, making revenue easier to generate. The advertising industry hated it but the result was Channel 4's most radical decade, funding a new wave of British independent film from artists and directors such as Terence Davies, Derek Jarman, John Akomfrah and Peter Greenaway, and pathbreaking programmes such as Out on Tuesday, Desmond's, Bandung File and After Dark.

In the 1990s, Conservative media policy fostered more competition in the TV ad market, largely to benefit the advertising industry, and Channel 4 jettisoned much of its earlier radicalism. The danger now is that the intense competition for revenue online will see the channel's trade-off tilt even more towards commercialism.

There is a solution, though. Borrowing an idea from Sweden, which introduced a 6% tax on print advertising in the 1970s to subsidise its local newspapers, we could do something similar in the UK: a 6% tax on advertising across all formats, including online, would generate about £2.2bn a year (based on total UK ad spend of about £37bn in 2023). That would more than solve Channel 4's funding problems, almost doubling revenue for 2022.

The benefits would be enormous. Channel 4 could eliminate ads across TV and online. Its commissioning could aim simply at fulfilling its remit: making high quality, innovative, risk-taking programmes and films that promote unheard perspectives - and therefore doing what its more commercial rivals are too risk-averse to do.

Consider, for example, the potential impact on British independent film: total public funding across Film4, the BBC and BFI is thought to be less than £100m a year, which is significantly less than the cost of a single Hollywood blockbuster. The result, as the director Michael Winterbottom has pointed out, is that even great British directors tend to make a film every three or four years rather than every one or two. Yet the list of productions Film4 has backed is extraordinary.

With greater funding at its disposal, the channel could also make more big-budget drama and comedy series, and win back some of the young people abandoning British broadcasters for US imports. And it would be able to do all this safe in the knowledge that its funding is future-proof: as ad spending goes up - as it does, despite short-term fluctuations - so will Channel 4's funding, and with no need to periodically ask the government for funding increases.

Making this idea into reality would require a governing party unafraid to take on the companies that would have to pay the tax - particularly the advertising industry and ad-funded media companies (including the press). Clearly, the Conservatives would never do so. The question is, would Labour? The party's current strategy is based on winning over business and the press, and this policy would undoubtedly antagonise both. But it would also strengthen one of the media's few bastions of tolerance, diversity and pluralism, and one of its best supporters of radical, important, creative and innovative work. The prize is worth fighting for.","Channel 4 has announced plans to cut almost 250 jobs, sell its London HQ and drop a number of shows.

2024-02-01,Smoked monkey and whole sharks: the suitcase smugglers feeding Europe's hunger for bushmeat,"Customs officers and scientists are working together to combat the highly lucrative illicit trade in wildlife meat that is helping to push some species to extinction

At Brussels airport, customs staff are digging into suitcases and cooler boxes full of charred meats and fish. There are boxes of flies with shrivelled dead caterpillars and juicy live ones. It is 6am, and they are checking all hold luggage from four morning flights - three from Africa and one from China - in an attempt to stem the flow of illegal meat from wildlife making its way into Europe via this major transit hub. There is a lingering smell of dried seafood.

Staff here are used to finding all kinds of creatures in baggage, from a 1.5-metre basking shark folded inside a box to a whole smoked monkey. But most meat comes dried, smoked, charred and chopped, so it is hard to identify it. In some cases, that's probably the point. A hunk of meat being confiscated could be from a cane rat, catfish, monkey or pangolin - or it could just be a bit of beef.

Researchers estimate 3.9 tonnes of bushmeat a month is smuggled through this airport, including bits of elephants, pangolins and crocodiles, and demand for bushmeat has become one of the main drivers of wildlife trafficking. The trade in some species has created a ""significant extinction threat"" to some wildlife populations, particularly in Asia, Africa and South America, according to the first global assessment of hunting's effect on terrestrial mammals.

Millions of people around the world rely on bushmeat as a source of local protein. However, it is increasingly being funnelled into a lucrative organised trade, providing luxury goods to an international market which pushes prices up.

A recent Europe-wide effort to tackle it, Operation Thunder, resulting in more than 2,000 seizures of endangered animals and protected timber during a law enforcement crackdown in October. The illegal wildlife trade is one of the most profitable areas for organised crime and is continuing to grow, Interpol warns. It also poses a significant risk to human health.

Researchers tracking personal baggage through Paris's Charles de Gaulle airport have found entire sheep and calves wrapped in plastic and placed in holdalls, which had apparently been slaughtered just before boarding.

These were not protected species, but the movement of animal carcasses and products risks the creation of novel infectious diseases, as well as spreading existing ones, such as mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) and Ebola. There is no easy way of testing for pathogens on these bits of meat in an airport, even if officials knew which pathogens to look for.

""Covid was a warning shot,"" says Sandrella Morrison-Lanjouw, a biosurveillance researcher from Utrecht University. ""Contaminated meat from a wet market in Africa can be in Europe in less than eight hours, but we won't find what we are not looking for.""

The scale of the illegal bushmeat trade is unknown, but scientific reviews suggest it is becoming increasingly commercialised, with more demand in overseas cities and urban centres as well as rural areas. Within Africa, reports from countries including Angola and Nigeria suggest there is increasing demand in big cities, with more people dependent on the trade for income.

As customs staff dig through the bags in Brussels, they confiscate all meat, as well as all fish that is not dried or gutted, free from insects and weighing less than 20kg (44lb).

Usually, confiscated meat is incinerated, as it is too costly and complicated to find out what these animals could be. This makes it impossible to provide scientific data on the extent of this trade via airports.

Authorities say some individuals fly in every week, with as much as 80kg of luggage. ""For them, it's an income,"" says Maarten Weyters, team leader of Brussels airport customs checks. Most planes do not undergo full checks on the baggage, as this one has.

In 2023 Weyters says, his team found 56 items of wildlife listed as endangered by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites), including pangolin, coral and crocodile. ""I think most of them know it's illegal,"" Weyters says. ""It's also illegal where they live."" Today is relatively quiet: 10 seizures, adding up to 75kg of contraband wildlife.

Meat is found concealed under dried fish or bags of vegetables and herbs, and is often wrapped in black binliners. In many packages, the meat is already decaying, dotted with maggots and flies. These can pose a risk to biodiversity, introducing insect pests and potential pathogens to new environments.

""Very little is known about the true volume of this meat,"" says Morrison-Lanjouw, who written extensively on unregulated meat imports. The level of transparency at Brussels is unique, she says - very few airports in Europe will let researchers study what is happening. The issue is a ""biosurveillance blind spot for the EU"", she adds.

A key problem is identifying the meat quickly, so law enforcement can intervene. To get around this, researchers take a portable DNA testing unit to the airport - the first time such a device has been used to test bushmeat in a European airport, they believe.

The technology needs to be as rapid and simple as possible, says Emily Patterson, a PhD researcher in forensic DNA analysis at Leicester University. ""The ideal scenario is someone with minimal training could do all of this.""

Wearing hazmat suits, Patterson and Morrison-Lanjouw prick meat samples and pass them through the MinION, a machine developed by an Oxford University spin-off to extract DNA. The kit can fit inside a suitcase and identify samples within eight hours.

One man casually announces he is carrying duiker, an African antelope, including one 500g joint that he says he could sell for $30 (£24). The DNA sequencing test shows that the two species he had were bay duiker and Maxwell's duiker, both species listed in Cites' Appendix II, meaning trade must be controlled to avoid over-exploitation.

The bay duiker is listed as near threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, though Maxwell's duiker is classified on its red list as being of least concern.

However, both populations are decreasing and the demand for bushmeat is one of the factors driving their decline. Pork, beef and north African catfish were also identified by the scientists as being in the luggage. Other results came back inconclusive - this could be because the animal had not yet been added to the GenBank genetic sequence database.

The bushmeat found by the scientists represents only a tiny fraction of the trade, which tends to favour delivery by air or by post.

""[Flights are] the fastest way to enter, while seaports normally require longer transit time,"" says Anne-Lise Chaber, a researcher at Adelaide University. A study she led in 2010 found that nearly one in 12 passengers searched on flights from west and central African countries were carrying bushmeat. Commodities that do not need to be transported so urgently - such as pangolin scales or the bones of tigers and lions - are more likely to be in shipping containers.

It is likely that what is happening in Brussels and Paris is occurring in airports all over Europe. It shows if you want to find illegally trafficked wildlife, it is easy to do, but few people are looking. ""It's coming in everywhere,"" says Morrison-Lanjouw.

From Brussels, meat that is not caught by customs will make its way to the markets in European cities such as Paris, where traders can get double the price of supermarket meat, Chaber has found in previous research - showing consumers are willing to pay premium prices for these products.

Chaber says some customers believe it is healthier to eat bushmeat, while others some find it tastier. ""We have to work with the community and see what could replace bushmeat,"" she says. ""I'm not against consumption of bushmeat locally, I am against the international trade.""

In 2008 she went around markets in Paris posing as a potential customer to find out how simple it would be to buy bushmeat. ""It was very easy,"" she says. In the years since, however, little has changed to stop the flood of meat into European markets - and the accompanying declines in wildlife. ""The truth is, I know that it's still very easy.""","Researchers estimate 3.9 tonnes of bushmeat a month is smuggled through Brussels airport.

2024-02-01,Bank of England keeps interest rates at 5.25%,"Borrowing costs remain at highest level since 2008 financial crisis despite falling inflation and weaker growth

The Bank of England has kept interest rates at 5.25%, the highest level since the 2008 financial crisis, despite falling inflation and weaker economic growth.

In a widely expected decision, the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) judged that the impact of 14 previous rate rises would be enough to ensure inflation continued to fall back to the 2% target set by the government.

Financial markets had predicted rates would be left unchanged for a fourth consecutive time after a steady decline in inflation over recent months, despite a small increase in December from 3.9% to 4%.

Economists predict UK inflation could fall below 2% within months amid a drop in global energy prices, helping to pave the way for interest rate cuts of as much as 1 percentage point later this year. However, concerns are mounting over disruption to international trade in the Red Sea amid the Israel-Gaza war, and the impact on prices.

The Bank has left borrowing costs unchanged since September, having paused its most aggressive hiking cycle in decades after lifting rates from a record low of 0.1% in December 2021.",Borrowing costs remain at highest level since 2008 financial crisis.

2024-02-01,'I can pay my council tax!': the ever-shrinking world of TV prize money,"Lamborghinis! Holiday homes! Being able to afford petrol! Once upon a time, winning a reality or quiz show meant you could live like an oligarch. Today? Not so much ...

When Anthony Hutton won the sixth series of Big Brother in 2005, he could ""go into shops and not even have to look at the price tag"". Hutton, now a 41-year-old barber and mental health advocate based in Darlington, spent his £50,000 prize lavishly. By combining it with earnings from magazine photoshoots, he was able to buy a Range Rover, take a trip to Las Vegas and buy some property. He even bought his aunt a holiday to Disney World. ""I drove to the Monaco Grand Prix in a Lamborghini,"" he recalls. ""Previously, the most extravagant place I'd been to was Magaluf.""

When 26-year-old Jordan Sangha won the latest series of Big Brother in November, a look of contentment washed over his face. ""I can pay my council tax,"" he grinned.

People appear on reality TV for any number of reasons: fame, glory, finally getting to taste kangaroo testicles. Yet an undeniable draw is the cash prize, which has been a constant on British TV since the 1955 gameshow Take Your Pick! But - as often seems to be the case - things aren't what they used to be. When the latest series of reality competition The Traitors debuted on BBC One in early January, host Claudia Winkleman asked contestants what they would spend £120,000 on if they won.

""I don't have anything or anybody to fall back on,"" said one participant, ""so it's my one chance to get my foot on the ladder."" (She was ""banished"" from the show in episode four.) Another contestant wanted to pay off their mum's mortgage; one wanted to foot the bill for his brothers and sisters when they went out to eat. Only one person spoke of travelling the world. Another said she couldn't get married because of the cost of living crisis: ""I'd love to get married, I really would.""

What was once attainable is now aspirational. This isn't news to anyone who has tried to buy a bottle of ketchup recently, but it's interesting to see it affect the dreams of reality TV wannabes. Hutton was a postal worker when he went on Big Brother - he had just given up his dreams of playing professional football and thought: ""Is this it?"" He applied to be on the show because he knew it could change his life. He was right. But now, do people apply simply to pay their bills?

Big Brother's first ever winner, Craig Phillips, donated his £70,000 prize money to pay for a friend's heart and lung transplant. The series' second winner, Brian Dowling, has been quoted as saying: ""At least half was spent on travelling, holidays, turning left, turning right, designer clothes."" He even bought a Gucci belt with his name on it. Yet post-recession, after Chloe Wilburn won the largest Big Brother UK prize pot of £116,100 in 2015, she promptly returned to work. Wilburn said she wanted to get married and have a child - she also made an offer on a house. ""I can't [waste my winnings], my mum's got my money,"" she said. ""She wanted to keep my feet on the ground just so I don't blow it on crazy trips to Benidorm.""

Of course, a narrative of decline isn't one-size-fits-all - to a certain extent, reality TV contestants have always wanted to keep up with the cost of living. The first ever Britain's Got Talent winner, Paul Potts, spent his £100,000 winnings paying off his debts. The second winner of the show, George Sampson, repeatedly spoke about money troubles on the show, saying that he had busked to buy his mum petrol and was ""hoping for a better life"" for his family. Producers have long known that some stories hold more sway with viewers than others. Still, serial gameshow contestant Mike Stratton sheds light on how things have changed over the years.

""These days, with bills rising, the money tends to go on daily needs rather than luxuries,"" says 55-year-old Stratton, who has appeared on 18 quizshows and written a book called How to Get on Game Shows and Win £1000's: Confessions of a Game Show Addict. In total, he has won £70,000 in cash and prizes in the last 23 years - he spent it on laser-eye surgery, IVF, cars and holidays. Yet he says his latest winnings, £2,400 from the BBC gameshow Decimate in 2016, were spent on paying off credit card debt.

Stratton, a male stripper who lives in Wigan, says that now, you would have to win £40,000 to be able to spend like he did when he won £10,000 20 years ago. His first ever win was on the 2001 gameshow Greed, that was hosted by Jerry Springer - he answered just one question (Q: ""What building is at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington DC?"" A: ""The White House"") and won £10,000. ""We spent it on a house deposit, a holiday and several other bits,"" Stratton says. In the year 2000, the average house deposit was £9,865. In 2023, it was £62,500. To put things another way: 20 years ago, you would only have to get to question eight out of 15 on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? to be most of the way towards a deposit; now you'd have to get to question 11.

Not only has the cost of living increased in the last two decades, prize money has often simultaneously decreased - most famously when the then eight-year-old Channel 4 quiz The Million Pound Drop downgraded to The £100k Drop in 2018. When Survivor debuted in 2001, its prize money was also £1m; when it returned to screens in 2023, it had also been slashed to a tenth of its original offering.

Even winnings that have stayed the same have arguably decreased. Though Britain's Got Talent winners have received a whopping £250,000 each since 2013, inflation means that the prize money would have to be increased to £330,000 to be of equal value today.

Hutton believes that prize-winnings should increase in line with inflation - not simply because of the cost of living, but also because ""you would get better TV"". Hutton theorises that a £250,000 prize pot on Love Island would inspire ""really conniving gameplay - you're going to potentially get people that will compromise their character to get that money.""

Some telly is still offering big bucks - two NHS workers Helen and Charlie recently won £1m on Ant and Dec's Limitless Win, the premise of which is in the name (there is no cap on the potential prize). Still, even then, the married couple said the first thing they would do with the prize is pay off their mortgage, adding: ""We also need a new secondhand car."" Two decades ago, when a Scottish nurse won £1m on The Vault in 2004 (back then, this was the largest amount ever won on live TV), her first thought was of a luxury trip to St Lucia.

A year earlier in 2003, a student who won £700,000 on The Vault did speak of buying a home - but a holiday one, in Spain.

Perhaps contestants these days simply don't want to boast, but there is no denying that prize-winnings don't go as far as they used to. Between 2022 and 2023, package holidays increased by 30% in price. The phrase ""£1m home"" used to conjure up images of mansions and butlers - now it describes a three-bed terrace house in London. Some shows have acknowledged our darkening days: in 2022, This Morning notoriously ran a spin-to-win competition where the prize was having four months worth of energy bills paid off.

It can't help but feel a bit dystopian when people enter competitions not to live lavishly, but simply to live. Though we are still a long way off, we are arguably closer to The Hunger Games than ever before. In this environment, how will viewers react to villainous behaviour on-screen? On shows such as The Traitors, players often excuse their manipulation of others with the oft-repeated phrase: ""It's just a game."" But if the prize money is a roof over someone's head or their pension pot, the stakes have never been higher.","Big Brother winner Anthony Hutton spent £50,000 on a Lamborghini and a trip to Las Vegas.

2024-02-01,EU agrees €50bn package for Ukraine as Viktor Orbán bows to pressure,"All 27 leaders agree deal after 11th-hour meetings with Hungarian prime minister, who had vowed to block the funds

Viktor Orbán has agreed a deal with fellow EU leaders on a €50bn support package for Ukraine after pulling back from the brink for a second time at a summit in Brussels.

The Hungarian prime minister, who had been vowing to block the funds since December, finally succumbed to pressure after a series of 11th-hour meetings with the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, the French president, Emmanuel Macron and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, as well as the European Commission and Council presidents, Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel.

""I think he just going see any more options. He cashed in,"" said one senior source.

Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, said the decision ""once again proves strong EU unity"". The four-year package is designed to keep Ukraine's economy afloat, with cash for hospitals, schools and civil servants wages and pensions.

""Continued EU financial support for Ukraine will strengthen long-term economic and financial stability, which is no less important than military assistance and sanctions pressure on Russia,"" he said.

The deal surprised everyone gathered in Brussels for the emergency summit which was called after Orbán blocked the €50bn fund in December.

""The mood this morning was not good, nobody was expecting this,"" said a diplomat.

Two additional paragraphs were added to the draft conclusions agreed by leaders but sources say neither amounted to a win for Orbán. ""He didn't get anything,"" said one source close to those in the room.

One new paragraph calls for the European Council to invite the European Commission to review the budgetary framework in two years' time.

""There is no veto,"" said a spokesperson for the European Council. However, the new paragraph allows for a ""debate"" on the fund ""if needed"".

Announcing the deal, Micheal tweeted: ""We have a deal. #Unity ""All 27 leaders agreed on an additional €50 billion support package for Ukraine within the EU budget.

""This locks in steadfast, long-term, predictable funding for #Ukraine.

""EU is taking leadership & responsibility in support for Ukraine; we know what is at stake.""

European leaders expressed their frustration and anger with Orbán on the way into the summit. Asked what he would be saying to Orbán, the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, was short: ""Nothing nice.""

By 11.30am some of the leaders were talking of going home early, furious that they had been dragged to Brussels only for Orbán to cave to pressure at the last minute.

But also on the agenda at the summit is the Middle East and extra military funds for Ukraine.","Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán agrees €50bn support package for Ukraine.

2024-02-01,"Hindus can worship in contested mosque, Indian court rules","Fears decision on Gyanvapi mosque in Varanasi could increase religious tensions and inspire more claims

An Indian court has ruled that Hindus can worship inside a contested mosque, a verdict that it is feared will increase religious tensions and galvanise further claims against other Muslim places of worship.

Gyanvapi mosque, in the holy city of Varanasi, was built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb and has been in use by Muslims for prayer ever since.

Since 2021 the mosque has been subjected to dozens of legal petitions by Hindus who are fighting for the right to pray there, claiming it is the site of an ancient Hindu temple and Hindu deities were present there. They also claimed Hindu priests had worshipped in the mosque cellar until 1993.

The mosque committee has been fighting the case, arguing that it has been used solely by Muslims for hundreds of years and is protected by the Places of Worship Act. The law, enacted shortly after India's independence, froze the status of all religious places of worship as they existed on 15 August 1947 and prohibits their conversion to any other faith.

As the legal disputes against the mosque reached 24 petitions, a judge ordered the site to be surveyed, during which it was claimed a religious icon of the Hindu god Lord Shiva was found in the mosque, and that area was sealed off. However, the mosque committee has argued it is not a religious icon but part of a fountain for washing feet.

Last week, a court-ordered archaeological survey released a report saying it had found evidence ""there existed a large Hindu temple prior to the construction of the existing structure"" in the 17th century.

On Wednesday, the Allahabad high court ruled the Hindu petitioners could worship in the basement of the mosque. The judge said the barriers around the mosque should be removed by the end of the week to make way for Hindu devotees.

Syed Mohammad Yaseen, 77, who has been the caretaker of Gyanvapi mosque for more than 32 years, said the order was ""disappointing"" for the Muslim community.

""The Hindus are saying that they used to pray inside the mosque campus until 1993 but this is completely untrue,"" he said. ""In its over 350-year history, Hindus had not prayed inside the mosque. All the claims of presence of Hindu iconography, idols etc inside the mosque are not true at all.""

Yaseen claimed the legal processes had been biased against the Muslim petitioners: ""All agencies, including the surveying agency and judiciary, have been on the side of our opponent. We have no hope for justice in this country.""

Hours after the order came through, the local administration removed part of the barricades surrounding Gyanvapi and made way for the Hindu priests to perform a prayer in the cellar, after which lamps were lit around the southern wall of the mosque, with dozens of Hindu devotees present.

In Varanasi, many road signs showing the way to the mosque were defaced by activists on Thursday who pasted papers printed with ""temple"" over the word ""mosque"".

Sita Sahoo, one of the Hindu petitioners, said she was overjoyed to be able to pray at the site and expressed her belief a temple would soon be built in place of the mosque.

""Now we are eagerly waiting for the day a grand Vishweshwara temple will be constructed at the site,"" she said. ""I am confident that the day when we will see the temple standing there is not that far.""

Last week, India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, inaugurated the Ram Mandir temple in Ayodhya, built on the site of a former mosque that had been similarly contested as a holy site for Hindus. The mosque was illegally torn down by a rightwing Hindu mob in 1992 and a Hindu temple later constructed in its place.

The success of the campaign to build a temple in Ayodhya has been seen as galvanising Hindu claims for a growing number of mosques across India to be demolished to make way for Hindu temples, with Gyanvapi one of the most high-profile cases.

The Gyanvapi mosque committee's lawyer, Akhlaque Ahmed, said Wednesday's court order would be challenged in the high court, but he was not optimistic about the outcome.

""The government belongs to them. The entire system belongs to them. We do not have any power,"" said Ahmed.","Gyanvapi mosque, in Varanasi, was built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb.

2024-02-01,10 Things I Hate About You review - Taming of the Shrew in high school is far from clueless,"It's the smartest, funniest and most likeable film of the week and is, moreover, in the most charming and unselfconscious manner possible, a homage to William Shakespeare

Can it really be true that high school teen comedy is emerging as one of the freshest and most literate genres in American cinema? I sat down to 10 Things I Hate About You ready to groan and to patronise. The set-up is that Katharine ""Kat"" Stratford (Julia Stiles) is a clever, pretty, but gloweringly unpopular 18-year-old at Padua High School in Seattle. Kat is, like, a total bitch. Her simpering 16-year-old sister Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) is keen to date boys, but her strict dad says she can't - until Kat does. So guys who wish to go out with her have somehow to fix up the ferociously undatable Kat before they get to smooch with Bianca.

It's the smartest, funniest and most likeable film of the week and is, moreover, in the most charming and unselfconscious manner possible, a homage to William Shakespeare. There are naturally lots of clues in the place names, and the plot is loosely based on The Taming of the Shrew, with a generous pinch of Much Ado About Nothing.

Padua High's mise-en-scène is familiar from Alicia Silverstone's exquisite Clueless: a new guy, Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), is introduced to the school's various preposterous cliques and in-crowds. Cameron's mentor is the nervy, Woody Allen-ish Michael (David Krumholtz), who is obsessed with a girl called Mandella, a William Shakespeare nut. When Michael sees the picture of Shakespeare in Mandella's locker, he points, nonplussed, to the Elizabethan ruff around the Bard's neck and asks: ""Is that to stop him licking his stitches?"" It got a roof-raising laugh at the screening I attended.

Clueless was taken from Jane Austen, Cruel Intentions from Les Liaisons Dangereuses. Where is this fashion for teenage literary makeover coming from? Partly, I think, from the continuing slow-burning success in America, in video-store rental form, of Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet, starring cult teenage idols Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, which was a refreshing, viscerally powerful reworking of Shakespeare's mawkish early tragedy.

Danes herself was the star of the teen-angst TV drama My So-Called Life, a mod ern classic of American television, in which she starred opposite the exquisitely handsome Jared Leto - said in this film to be a secret pin-up of Kat's. And there are a couple of scenes which are clearly taken from this hugely popular television series, particularly a scene in the English class where the bored, disaffected kids gradually become interested in the Shakespeare sonnet they have been set as an assignment.

In 10 Things, Kat and her schoolmates have to discuss Sonnet 141 (""In faith I do not love thee with my eyes/For they in thee a thousand errors note""), then rewrite the poem in modern English, but in iambic pentameters. By the end of the film, Kat has completed her effort, an impassioned rap about the boy she has been tricked into falling in love with: the 10 things she hates about him.

We have all been accustomed to thinking of ""dumbing down"" and ""modern commercial American cinema"" as one and the same, and many is the time we have railed against the juvenilisation of the cinema fostered in the US. But 10 Things runs counter to this preconception: it actually shows young people reading books, knowing about books - by Sylvia Plath and Betty Friedan. Why aren't we Brits making intelligent, bookish movies for young audiences? Why aren't we, with our Mount Kilimanjaro of lottery cash and mighty cultural heritage, making this sort of thing? Why is it we can only come up with Virtual Sexuality (a commercially produced film), which talks down to its teenage audiences, while movies like 10 Things, Cruel Intentions or Clueless - films expected to make their way in the marketplace - pay their youthful target audience the compliment of being at least potentially bright enough to understand literary references?

10 Things is a bright little romantic comedy, nicely and sharply written, which wears its learning winningly and lightly.","10 Things I Hate About You is the smartest, funniest and most likeable film of the week.

2024-02-01,The Last Dinner Party: Prelude to Ecstasy review - the year's most hyped band totally deliver,"(Island)

The five-piece ground their Sparks-like tendency towards excess and musical theatre with consistently well-written songs primed for festival singalongs

It's hard to think of the last time a band elected to open their debut album with an orchestral overture. But that's how the Last Dinner Party's debut begins: woodwind, brass and strings turned up to 11, further decorated with crashing cymbals and shimmering harp. It's so grandiose, even the director of a 1950s Hollywood blockbuster would have suggested his soundtrack composer dial it down a bit. It's also bold to the point of seeming faintly provocative, but then if you were in the Last Dinner Party, you'd probably be feeling confident, too. They begin 2024 in receipt of both this year's BBC Sound of... award and the Brits' Rising Star gong. Their preceding 12 months have been an inexorable rise. They started selling out gigs when they had released less than nine minutes of music, were lavished with praise by everyone from Florence Welch to Garth Crooks (the latter feeling impelled to interrupt an episode of Football Focus to describe them as ""fine young women making really exciting pop music"") and have weathered the inevitable accusations of being an ""industry plant"" that seem as much part of an artist's swift progress in the 21st century as breathless this-band-will-change-your-life coverage in the weekly music press once was.

Still, you can see why people might look askance at the Last Dinner Party. They seem to have arrived fully formed, although that's the result of nothing more sinister than frantic woodshedding during the gig-free Covid years: looking fabulous and teeming with ideas, among them their penchant for announcing dress codes for their gigs - Victoriana, Brothers Grimm, Velvet Goldmine - a smart way of both lifting their shows out of the ordinary and creating a sense of IRL community. Their debut single Nothing Matters featured a chorus so preposterously nailed-on that, on first listen, you could already imagine a field full of festival-goers howling along to it. Prelude to Ecstasy is well produced - boasting string arrangements mercifully less histrionic than the introduction might suggest, a glossy sheen and some nice touches courtesy of James Ford, the long, shoegaze-y coda of bending tones that concludes On Your Side among them - but it doesn't sound that different from the video of their third gig that was posted to YouTube, sparking a stampede among major labels and management companies.

Said sound is genuinely striking. If the whole themed dress code thing vaguely recalls mid-70s Roxy Music - who didn't explicitly announce how their audience should dress, but might as well have done, given that their gigs were staffed by crowds determinedly copying whatever look Bryan Ferry was sporting that week - the most apposite musical comparison might be Roxy's glam era contemporaries Sparks. There's a distinct hint of Russell Mael about Abigail Morris's more rococo vocal flourishes and something of the duo's penchant for high drama in the Last Dinner Party's willingness to shift tempos and juxtapose musical genres midway through songs: Our Lady of Mercy jumps from sophisticated 80s-facing pop to a muscular hard-rock grind; Sinner shifts from staccato piano to itchy Franz Ferdinand-ish post-punk; there's both a keen pop sensibility on display and a surprising number of what the Darkness' Justin Hawkins approvingly described as ""proper guitar solos"": lead guitarist Emily Roberts favours soaring, impressively stadium-ready axe heroics.

Operatic cut-glass vocals, sudden shifts in mood and tempo, big guitar solos, plus lyrics that transform relationship woe into the stuff of jump-scare-heavy crime drama (""now there's blood in my lipgloss"", ""I wish I had given you the courtesy of ripping out my throat"", ""I am a dark red liver stretched out on the rocks""): as you might expect, there are moments when all this becomes a bit much, as when they break out the timpani literally seconds into Mirror, or Beautiful Boy sails a little too close to musical theatre for its own good. But it doesn't happen very often, mostly because Prelude to Ecstasy is filled with really well-written songs. The rhythmic and stylistic transitions are handled so smoothly that they never feel episodic or meandering, all that woodshedding seems to have left them with both an enviable melodic assurance and a surfeit of fantastic choruses: not just Nothing Matters, but Feminine Urge, Burn Alive and - percussion excesses or not - Mirror.

Of course, they face the problem faced by all bands who arrive fully formed: if you turn up with your sound and image and songs just so, where do you go next? But Prelude to Ecstasy is a delight, filled with enough ideas to suggest that they'll come up with just as many more the next time around: the Last Dinner Party's confidence may stem less from the hype they've provoked than the fact they know how good they are.

2024-02-01,Elon Musk acts to move Tesla legal base to Texas after pay package ruling,"Tycoon announces shareholder vote on relocating after Delaware judge strikes down $56bn pay package as 'unfathomable'

Elon Musk has announced Tesla will hold a vote on moving the company's legal base to Texas after the state of Delaware threw out his $56bn pay package at the electric vehicle maker.

The world's richest person, whose No 1 status is endangered by the Delaware ruling, held a poll on X asking whether Tesla should change the company's state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas.

With more than 1m votes cast, the poll recorded 87% in favour of moving. Responding on Thursday, Musk wrote on his X account: ""The public vote is unequivocally in favour of Texas! Tesla will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation to Texas.""

On Tuesday, a Delaware judge called a 2018 share-based package awarded to the Tesla chief executive ""an unfathomable sum"" that was unfair to shareholders, and struck down the arrangement.

Soon after, Musk wrote on X: ""Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware"". He added: ""I recommend incorporating in Nevada or Texas if you prefer shareholders to decide matters"".

Musk has strong ties with Texas. He moved Tesla's corporate headquarters from Palo Alto in California to the Texas city of Austin in 2021 after criticising California's regulations and taxes, and also clashing with health officials at the start of the Covid pandemic over reopening a factory in Fremont.

One of the carmaker's gigafactories is in Texas and it is building a $1bn lithium refinery in the state, aiming to produce enough battery-grade lithium for about 1m vehicles by 2025.

Other Musk companies, including the rocket firm SpaceX and the tunnelling business the Boring Company, also have operations in Texas. Another Musk-related Texas expansion is under way at X, which he also owns, after the social media platform announced last month it would open a content moderation office in Austin with 100 staff.

It was not immediately clear whether the Tesla board supported Musk's X declaration on Thursday. The Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick in her ruling on Tuesday, wrote that Musk, a 13% shareholder in Tesla, had ""thick ties"" with the directors negotiating his 2018 package and had ""dominated the process that led to board approval of his compensation plan"".

Two weeks before the Delaware ruling, Musk challenged the board by writing on X that he needed to own 25% of Tesla's voting shares or else he might build unspecified artificial intelligence and robotics products outside the company.

Musk is worth $202bn, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index, more than the luxury goods tycoon Bernard Arnault, on $183bn, and Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, on $180bn.","Elon Musk has announced Tesla will hold a vote on moving the company's legal base to Texas.

2024-02-01,Lewis Hamilton poised to make shock Ferrari switch for 2025 F1 season,"Scuderia in advanced talks to poach seven-time world champion

Lewis Hamilton could be set to make a shock move to join Ferrari in 2025. The seven-time Formula One world champion is reportedly in the advanced stages of negotiation with the Scuderia but no deal has yet been signed.

The 39-year-old has been linked with a potential move to Ferrari in the past but has repeatedly insisted he would stay with current team Mercedes, suggesting he would see out his career with the team and then take on an ambassadorial role with them. However it is understood Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, and technical director James Allison are set to hold a meeting with staff at 2pm on Thursday.

Hamilton is known to have had discussions with the Ferrari chief executive, John Elkann, who has made his desire to bring him to the Scuderia clear and the team admitted they had held discussions with Hamilton about the chances of the British driver joining them in 2019. Previous rumours of a move to Ferrari have proved unfounded,however, the latest reports are understood to be based on serious talks between Hamilton and Ferrari and may be confirmed as early as Thursday afternoon.

Mercedes, Ferrari and Hamilton's representatives have yet to comment on the reports.

Hamilton concluded a new contract with Mercedes in August of last year to extend his deal with the team through 2024 and 2025. It appears, though, he may have had an option allowing him to step away from the second season and join Charles Leclerc at Maranello.

Hamilton has been with Mercedes since 2013 and won six of his seven world championships with the team. However, since 2022 their car has been well off the pace of the dominant Red Bull and he has been unable to challenge for the title. He has made his disappointment and frustration at their performance clear but always insisted that he was confident the team would come back. This season they are bringing an entirely new design to attempt to bridge the gap.

A move to Ferrari would not guarantee success however. They too have struggled under the new regulations, finishing third in the championship last year, behind Red Bull and Mercedes. They have not won a drivers title since Kimi Raikkonen did so in 2007 and have not won a constructors' championship since 2008.

At the Monaco GP last year Hamilton responded to rumours about a move to Ferrari by emphatically denying he had been in talks with the team. However after his new contract with Mercedes was announced he did concede he was already thinking of his future in the sport.

""In terms of long-term, I'm thinking about my next contract, what that will look like, how long that will be. I plan to be here for a while,"" he said.",Scuderia in advanced talks to poach seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton. Hamilton has been linked with a potential move to Ferrari in the past.

2024-02-01,Labour rules out raising corporation tax above 25% in next parliament,"Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves unveils raft of measures at business summit aimed at boosting investment, productivity and certainty

Labour will not raise corporation tax above its current rate of 2025 during the next parliament, the party has pledged, in an attempt to offer businesses greater certainty.

Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the tax pledge included maintaining full expensing, which allows businesses that invest in IT equipment and machinery to claim back up to 100% of the cost of the investment by writing it off against tax on their profits. She said Labour would also maintain the annual investment allowance introduced by Jeremy Hunt.

Speaking at a conference in London attended by 400 business executives, Reeves said business and government must work together ""like never before.""

She said: ""We reject the calls from those on the right wing of the Conservative party to cut corporation tax. Our current rate is the lowest in the G7. We believe that a 25% rate strikes the correct balance between the needs of our public finances, and the demands of a competitive global economy.

""The next Labour government will make the pro-business choice and the pro-growth choice. We will cap the headline rate of corporation tax at its current rate of 25% for the next parliament. And should our competitiveness come under threat, if necessary, we will act.""

She accused the government of pushing through Brexit without a plan and churning through a succession of ministers that brought instability and uncertainty.

Reeves has sought to woo the business community over several years as part of a strategy to improve the Labour party's image for managing the economy.

""This Labour party sees profit as not something to be disdained, but of business succeeding,"" she said.

The conference, for which tickets sold out within hours, heard that Labour will listen to the concerns of UK firms, overhauling the planning system and investing in green infrastructure.

Angela Raynor, Labour's deputy leader, said there would be enhanced rights for workers ""because you tell us the a motivated workforce will improve productivity"".

On Wednesday, Reeves said she would not reinstate a cap on bankers' bonuses scrapped last year by the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt. She said it was a measure that came out of the 2008 financial crisis which was now over.",Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves unveils raft of measures aimed at boosting investment.

2024-02-01,The man who owes Nintendo $14m: Gary Bowser and gaming's most infamous piracy case,"The hacker whose involvement with anti-piracy software ended in a jail sentence has emerged from prison struggling to make rent as he starts paying his fine. 'It could be worse,' he says

In April 2023, a 54-year-old programmer named Gary Bowser was released from prison having served 14 months of a 40-month sentence. Good behaviour reduced his time behind bars, but now his options are limited. For a while he was crashing on a friend's couch in Toronto. The weekly physical therapy sessions, which he needs to ease chronic pain, were costing hundreds of dollars every week, and he didn't have a job. And soon, he would need to start sending cheques to Nintendo. Bowser owes the makers of Super Mario $14.5m (£11.5m), and he's probably going to spend the rest of his life paying it back.

Since he was a child, Bowser's life has revolved around tinkering with electronics. His dad was a mechanical engineer, and he learned from him how to wire up model trains and mod calculators. As a teenager he already had a computer business: his mother died when he was 15, his father had retired and Bowser supported him.

Bowser would go on to run an internet cafe, where patrons played Counter-Strike and Dance Dance Revolution, and repair hardware for a living. He got briefly caught up with the law during a stint fixing games consoles at flea markets, which nearly implicated him alongside vendors who sold pirated movies. Eventually he moved to the Dominican Republic in 2010. He spoke no Spanish for years, but he loved the island anyway: you could drive from one end to the other in just 12 hours, he recalls. It was here that Bowser - who, in a case of nominative determinism that feels almost too trite to acknowledge, shares a name with Super Mario's in-game antagonist - started becoming the face of Nintendo piracy.

In the late 00s he made contact with Team Xecuter, a group that produces dongles used to bypass anti-piracy measures on Nintendo Switch and other consoles, letting them illegally download, modify and play games. While he says he was only paid a few hundred dollars a month to update their websites, Bowser says the people he worked with weren't very social and he helped ""testers"" troubleshoot devices.

""I started becoming a middleman in between the people doing the development work, and the people actually owning the mod chips, playing the games,"" he says. ""I would get feedback from the testers, and then I would send it to the developers ... I can handle people, and that's why I ended up getting more involved.""

In September 2020, he was arrested in a sting so unusual that the US Department of Justice released a press release boasting about the indictment, in which acting assistant attorney general Brian C Rabbitt called Bowser and his co-defendants ""leaders of a notorious international criminal group that reaped illegal profits for years by pirating video game technology of US companies"".

""The day that it happened, I was sleeping in my bed, it was four in the morning, I'd been drinking all night,"" Bowser says. ""And suddenly I wake up and see three people surrounding my bed with rifles aimed at my head ... they dragged me out of the place, put me in the back of a pickup truck and drove me to the Interpol office.""

Bowser was arrested at the height of the pandemic, which complicated everything. He was imprisoned in a series of jails, and each transfer had Covid safety precautions that required him to spend time in isolation. Despite this, Bowser still caught the coronovirus and spent two weeks so sick that, he says, a priest would come over once a day to read him a prayer.

Bowser was charged with fraud over his connection to Team Xecuter. While in custody, he was also hit with a civil suit from Nintendo. Between the civil and criminal cases, he was ordered to pay $14.5m.

In transcripts from the court, Nintendo's lawyer Ajay Singh outlined the company's case against piracy. ""It's the purchase of video games that sustains Nintendo, and it is the games that make the people smile ... It's for that reason that we do all we can to prevent games on Nintendo systems from being stolen,"" he told the judge.

Pirates are usually fined in court, but Bowser's case was meant to draw attention. ""The sentence was like a message to other people that [are] still out there, that if they get caught ... [they'll] serve hard time,"" he says. As he tells it, Bowser didn't make or develop the products that sent him to prison; he ""just"" updated the websites that told people what they could buy, and kept them informed about what was coming next.

Bowser maintains that he could have fought the allegations, and that other members of the hacking group remain at large. But fighting against 13 charges would have cost time and money. It was easier, he claims, to plead guilty and only deal with a couple of the charges. As a part of that agreement, Bowser now has to send Nintendo 20-30% of any money left over after he pays for necessities such as rent.

""I'll pay them what I can, which won't be very much money, that's for sure,"" he says. Despite his predicament, Bowser counts his blessings. ""It could be a lot worse,"" he says. Bowser has now managed to secure housing, and he thinks that after rent, he has a couple of hundred dollars leftover for food and other necessities. He assumes he'll be turning to food support services.

While the months after his release have been bumpy and uncertain, he has still experienced worse. It's better than the time he spent homeless in his early 20s, he says. ""I have experienced many things over the years, bad situations and good."" He carried an optimistic outlook even while imprisoned; at one point he was paid to counsel other prisoners on suicide watch. ""A lot of other people were going crazy, banging their cell doors, screaming, yelling, harming themselves,"" he says. Bowser was paid a dollar an hour to help them, and his four-hour shifts allowed him to start chipping away at his pending bill. ""When I was in jail, I was paying Nintendo $25 a month,"" he recalls.

While inside, Bowser couldn't always get the medical attention he needed, he claims, and even when he did, the realities of prison still exacerbated his health issues - he has elephantiasis in his left leg. At times, due to Covid, Bowser could only leave his cell a few times a week and only for about 10 minutes. The rest of the time, he spent sitting.

""For a while I couldn't even get a shoe on my left foot, so I was walking around barefoot,"" he recalls.

At least there was a wheelchair to help him get around. Nowadays, Bowser only has a cane - but his leg hasn't letup. Bowser goes to physical therapy three times a week, but it's expensive. He is estranged from his family. Instead, it's his friends who are helping him buy food and clothes. He pays for medical care from a GoFundMe page dedicated to helping him restart his life, which received a few dozen donations. He is hoping that he can get disability payments soon. Since he got out, he's often gone without access to a refrigerator or a stove due to trouble paying his electricity bills.

In the meantime, and after months of inconsistent access to the internet, Bowser is looking for jobs. On his website, he lists all the services he can provide and while he has found a few coding gigs, he's been having a hard time securing anything long-term. Any prospective employer who does a background check will of course see his legal history with Nintendo, but that may not work against him. A cybersecurity company might welcome his tech expertise, regardless of how he got it. For now, he is getting back into his first love, retro hardware, tinkering away with old-school Texas Instruments calculators. Legally, he's not allowed to mess around with modern gaming hardware.

If there is one thing he is sure about, it's his talent. Before everything went down the drain, Bowser had started several businesses that were successful enough to have employees. ""I should be the executive in charge of the company, not someone working as a junior,"" he says. In that regard, he doesn't just share his surname with Mario's reptilian foe; he also, improbably, shares it with Nintendo of America's current president, Doug Bowser. Gary is certain that the executive can be found somewhere in his family tree, perhaps in a distant branch.

""I must be the first Bowser that's ever been arrested,"" he says, with a resigned laugh.","Gary Bowser, 54, was jailed for 40 months in April 2023.

2024-02-01,Trump's dark side: Inside the 2 February Guardian Weekly,"It had all seemed like business as usual for Donald Trump in the aftermath of last week's New Hampshire Republican primaries, where he scored a comfortable victory over his only remaining challenger, Nikki Haley. And yet ... was there something in his subsequent outburst towards Haley that suggested all was not well in Trumpworld?

Barring the mother of all reversals, Trump will soon be confirmed as the Republican presidential nominee. But, as David Smith and Jonathan Freedland outline in this week's big story, Trump remains a deeply polarising figure in American politics, not least within his own party.

And his petulant irritation at Haley over her refusal to concede the race was a visible reminder to American floating voters of the unhinged personality that lurks beneath the orange veneer, something his campaign team will be desperate to avoid more of.

""The shadow of Trump is long, and his return seems closer than ever,"" explains illustrator Alberto Miranda on his cover art for this week's Guardian Weekly. ""He is a controversial figure with a dangerous side and, at the same time, has an utterly comical aspect.

2024-02-01,CBS correspondent says he faced recent discrimination at Louisiana high school,"David Begnaud says Catholic alma mater barred news crew from filming on campus because he is openly gay

An award-winning reporter for a major US news broadcaster recently faced discrimination from the Roman Catholic high school he attended while growing up in Louisiana because he is openly gay, he has said.

David Begnaud - the lead national correspondent for the television news program CBS Mornings - encountered anti-gay discrimination when he traveled to Teurlings Catholic High School to report a profile on his freshman English teacher, Josette Surratt, he wrote in an opinion column on Nola.com. Begnaud said the school's current administration made him feel unwelcome at the campus because it didn't want students to think his sexuality was acceptable - treatment that is not consistent with how Pope Francis has been trying to make the worldwide Catholic church more welcoming to LGBTQ+ community members.

Begnaud's column explained that Surratt had helped him understand himself as a student who was gay, had Tourette syndrome and endured bullying, and that he wanted to share the pair's personal story with his program's viewers.

Surratt, Begnaud said, helped him ""become the person [he] was meant to be"".

However, while Surratt ""was genuinely thrilled to be the subject of the story"", she told her former student that it would be better if her interview were conducted off the campus of his old Lafayette, Louisiana, school. Begnaud was also told he could only record video of the campus once it was empty - a condition to which he agreed because he had believed Teurlings administrators simply didn't want the presence of a camera crew to disrupt the school day.

But then, Begnaud wrote: ""I got a phone call that took me right back to my childhood at the school where I'd often felt like an outcast. The caller told me the reason the school restricted my video recording was that the school's chancellor, Father Kyle White, was concerned that allowing me on campus might negatively affect the image of the Catholic school and suggest that it approved of my sexuality.

""Father White, the caller said, didn't want students to get the impression that being gay is OK.""

White also worried that the piece on Surratt would center on Begnaud's sexuality. The profile mentioned it, but, the journalist said, the report was primarily ""about this extraordinary teacher and human being"".

Begnaud said he chose to publish details about his recent experience at Teurlings out of concern for the school's students, whether they are ""straight, gay or anything else"".

""If the school is creating an environment in which gay students are treated like outsiders and straight students are led to believe that this is how the church would have it, it is not,"" Begnaud wrote.

Begnaud alluded to how the pope recently allowed Catholic priests to bless same-sex couples, changing longstanding Vatican policy.

The Teurlings alum called on the school to be similarly welcoming.

""I am asking for school leaders to have courage,"" said Begnaud, who donates money to Teurlings for a scholarship to be awarded annually to a student who embodies the quality of courage.

""It is a time to heal. And a time to love.""

Some of Begnaud's most affecting work saw him bring international attention to Puerto Rico and the neglectful federal response after Hurricane Maria devastated the island in 2017. His reporting on Maria's aftermath earned him the George Polk award for public service, one of journalism's most prestigious prizes.

Teurlings didn't respond to a request for comment on Begnaud's Nola.com column.

The Lafayette Catholic diocese to which Teurlings belongs has been making headlines in Louisiana for going to the state's supreme court and challenging the constitutionality of a law that retroactively and temporarily eliminated filing deadlines for lawsuits seeking damages for childhood sexual abuse.

The statute being challenged by Lafayette's diocese wasn't exclusively for clerical abuse victims, though it prompted many new cases of that nature against Catholic institutions in Louisiana.

The law is similar to the one in New York that allowed E Jean Carroll to sue Donald Trump over accusations that he sexually abused her in a dressing room in the mid-1990s before defaming her, claims that have resulted in judgments ordering the former president to pay the writer nearly $90m in damages.","David Begnaud: Catholic alma mater barred news crew from filming on campus because he is openly gay.

2024-02-01,Kids are on their phones more than ever. We asked parents what they're doing about it,"From phone curfews to leading by example, parents from around the world share views on their children's screen time

From bizarre TikTok fads to evading parental controls, managing your child's relationship with screens can be a minefield.

By age 11, 91% of children in the UK own a smartphone, according to data from the country's communications regulator, Ofcom, while a study of 19 European countries found 80% of children aged nine to 16 used one to go online daily, or almost daily. Meanwhile, recent survey data suggests 42% of US children have a smartphone by the age of 10, with 91% owning one by 14.

And it's not just that smartphones have become more prolific: the average length of time children and young people - and adults - spend on their devices has been ticking up in recent years. The trends has been supercharged by lockdowns: 79% of UK parents reported their children's screen time was up post-pandemic, though the latest 2023 global figures appear to show a return to pre-pandemic levels for adults. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2018, the average 11-to-14-year-old in the US spent nine hours daily in front of a screen.

Scores of parents from around the world told the Guardian about their children's relationships with screens, ranging from toddlers to teenagers across six continents. While a significant minority were satisfied with their children's smartphone use, most said they were unhappy with the time they spent online and the effect they believed it was having on their moods and concentration.

Steve, a parent to two teenage boys, 13 and 15, in the Netherlands, is among them. While he was unhappy with his sons' phone use, the 54-year-old felt conflicted about how to resolve it. ""One can't not allow the kids to have a smartphone, not only because technology has become a fundamental aspect of modern life, but because it's become part of how they interact with their peers,"" said Steve, who works for a system integrator company.

His family uses Google's Family Link to limit time spent on devices in tandem with more old-school methods, like a ""no phones at the table"" rule. They also discourage their children from ""multimedia consumption"": ""If you're watching TV, don't use your phone.""

Approaches to limiting the time their children spent in front of a glowing screen vary hugely. While some adopt a laissez-faire attitude, and others the ""prevention is the best cure"" method (zero, or strictly supervised access), most found themselves somewhere in the middle, imposing rules like ""no screens at night"". Parents told us about a variety of monitoring tools they relied on - though many complained that their children were adept at dodging these controls.

While some opted for switching off the wifi or confiscating devices, others attempted more cooperative approaches, advocating ""leading by example"", discussing their relationship to screens and encouraging other interests.

Parents like Aditya, 34, said their children spend less time online since they stepped in - something that is notably easier to do with younger children. Aditya, in Mumbai, said that his son was racking up to four hours daily staring at screens early last year. These days, the four-year-old is limited to half an hour a day of Peppa Pig and educational YouTube.

""His mother and I decided that the screen time is doing more harm than good, with his speech getting delayed and limited interaction with other children. It's taken a humongous effort to bring down his screen time and get more board games, books and physical activity in his life,"" Aditya, who works in banking, said. ""We've tried to understand our child's interests and then get related games and books for him.""

For Adrián, a 43-year-old engineer in São Paulo who limits his four-year-old daughter's screen time to 30 minutes a day, leading by example is key. ""Watching other people's behaviour, I've realised how much we lose when the mobile is our priority. I have seen a whole family at a restaurant watching their mobiles and not talking.

""I try to use my mobile less - how can I expect my daughter not to be dependent if I do not lead by example?""

Parents of teenagers in particular raised concerns about the effect social media was having on their children's mental wellbeing. Jane, 58, a psychologist in Cape Town, said her 15-year-old daughter had got around screen-time controls and was spending far longer than her allotted 45 minutes a day scrolling Instagram. Jane regularly chats with her daughter - who regards her monitoring as ""annoying but good"" - about how social media makes her feel. ""In my mind, it's not something to sort out and be done with, but keep talking about,"" Jane said.

Her daughter, who cannot access the internet at home between 9pm and 7am, only got a smartphone 18 months ago, and she is still experimenting. ""Instagram is the big one. She's not on TikTok because she can see what a rabbit hole it is - she tried it briefly and removed it herself,"" Jane explained. ""When she's stressed she turns to her devices even more, which I think exacerbates her stress.""

The speed of technological advancement can feel bewildering at times, and many parents felt overwhelmed by expectations that they should police their children's digital lives. Rob, a power plant worker in north-west England, said his 14-year-old spends five hours daily on her phone.

""We know she spends way too much time on her phone, but we don't really know how to reduce it. Our efforts are to try and encourage alternative activities,"" Rob, 43, said. ""Smartphone use is not the sole reason that my daughter's mental health has deteriorated, but it's such an easy go-to for instant satisfaction that it's become her safe place, when the opposite is true in many cases.

""People who say 'You should just put your foot down' don't really live in the real world. My daughter is 14, her phone is her life, her diary, her gateway into much of the world.""

For many parents, work and other commitments mean they struggle to regulate their child's screen time. Nga, a teacher in her 30s in Vietnam, has found it difficult to maintain oversight over the content her six-year-old consumes on his grandparents' phones while she's at work. ""I can't control the content he watches,"" she said, explaining that her child uses voice control to access videos and games. ""I'm unhappy with the amount of screen time consumed by my son - it's caused him problems related to his eyes,"" she said, adding that she also worries it is negatively influencing his behaviour.

The pandemic was a turning point for many young people's screen time. Charanjeet, the head of a food manufacturing company and a photographer in Singapore with two sons who are 12 and 15, said that things have not returned to how they were before. ""The device usage went through the roof and we have not been able to reverse the process,"" he said, though he acknowledged that his children also watch educational videos. ""We worry that so many things happening around them are being missed with their faces glued to screens and AirPods in their ears.""

But the content consumed matters too, and many parents said they were pleased to see their children learning new skills online. Eileen, 41, a researcher in Pennsylvania, said: ""We're raising her bilingual English-Spanish and some of the shows have helped her with vocabulary,"" explaining that her four-year-old daughter uses a tablet for around 90 minutes a day. Like other busy parents, she emphasised regretfully that it is her ""only tool to get things done in the house once we get home"". ""Setting time limits and finding appropriate content has been a challenge. We rely on parental controls.""

And for Jane, a 51-year-old product manager in Luxembourg and a parent to two teenagers, concerns around lengthy screen times are the wrong thing to focus on. ""Phones and tablets are going to be part of their lives - they need to learn to control their own use,"" she said, adding that her 14-year-old daughter acknowledges that she finds TikTok addictive and periodically deletes it. ""It's not about the device, it's about the content consumed. New technology creates an existential crisis which blows over.""

For some young people, the ubiquity of the internet is affecting their social world as the potential for in-person connection shrinks. Marie, a health worker in New Zealand, said that when her 15-year-old son hangs out with most of his friends, they sit siloed in their separate digital worlds. ""The norm is mostly sitting on their phones gaming, watching short videos or social media, even if they are together in real life. He finds it lonely and boring,"" Marie, 46, said.

""It is definitely impacting on his friendships. Catching up in real life seems to happen less, the kids generally go home and go online. He feels a bit lonely. He says: 'Life is OK and school is OK, except for socially.'""

Jack, Marie's 15-year-old son, told the Guardian about how the ubiquity of smartphones upped the social pressure at school too. ""How other kids smartphone use at school impacts me is negatively mostly ... Everyone with a smartphone is mainly using it for social media. In and out of class you have the constant threat of any slip-up being recorded and posted for all to see. Interactions are more extreme if someone is filming it, [like] arguments, fights.""

The teenager said it made it harder to concentrate in class ""if you have a bunch of people on their phones [and the phone screens] in the corner of your eyes"".

""My view is that phones would be fine if they only had texting and games, so that kids on them were affecting themselves, and not everyone else.""","By age 11, 91% of children in the UK own a smartphone, according to Ofcom data. 42% of US children have a phone by the age of 10, with 91% owning one by 14. 79% of UK parents reported their children's screen time was up post-pandemic.","[('smartphone', 0.4815), ('phone', 0.425), ('children', 0.3556), ('uk', 0.3036), ('parents', 0.2433), ('14', 0.2284), ('age', 0.2275), ('screen', 0.1972), ('pandemic', 0.1808), ('11', 0.1511)]","smartphone, phone, children, uk, parents, 14, age, screen, pandemic, 11",33
2024-02-01,How we met: 'We liked the same weird things',"Alan and JJ, both 50, met on a playdate when they were children. They became instant best friends and have supported each other ever since

Tell us your story of how you met someone special

When Alan was 10 years old, life wasn't always easy. Due to his academic talents, he was able to skip two years of school, but still found the work too simple. His parents decided home schooling would be a better option, but that also came with challenges. ""I was bullied by the local neighbourhood kids and had no friends,"" he says. ""My mom started looking for other kids my age who I might get along with.""

In the summer of 1983, she took him to meet JJ, who lived on a nearby farm in Lake Orion, Michigan.

JJ was also academic and feeling socially isolated at school. ""I didn't have any close friends at the time,"" he says. ""It was really nice to talk to someone who had a similar experience."" Alan says they clicked instantly. ""We were on the same wavelength.""

Alan introduced JJ to Dungeons and Dragons, while JJ showed his friend how to play a card game called canasta. ""We liked the same weird things,"" says JJ. ""I was heavily into fantasy at the time and we both loved reading books and talking."" They also went to the same church and became altar boys together.

When he was 13, Alan and his family moved to a small town 20 miles away. JJ admits he was ""terribly sad"" when Alan left. ""We were limited because long-distance phone calls were really expensive back then,"" he says.

At 16, Alan started at Oakland University, where he studied psychology. By then, both boys were able to drive, so they could see each other more often. Two years later, JJ joined the same college to study computer science and they found jobs together in the computer lab. ""We also made a group of friends who were all interested in the same things,"" says JJ.

After graduating, Alan worked briefly in tech support, before doing a doctorate in church history at the University of Chicago. He worked as a pastor for seven years in Indiana and got married in 2000. Around the same time, JJ left college early without graduating and found a job in technology. ""We were some of the first people to use the internet, so our skills were in demand,"" he says. He got married in 1997, to a woman he met at Alan's 21st birthday.

The pair stayed in touch, but saw each other less frequently. In the early 00s, JJ struggled with mental health problems and was later diagnosed with bipolar disorder. ""Despite what he was going through, he still always made an effort to speak to me,"" says Alan.

As well as his own health concerns, JJ was also caring for his wife, who suffered with complications relating to spina bifida. When she died in 2016, Alan was the first person he called. ""By then I was divorced and back working in technology, but I continued to be a hospital chaplain so I felt like I could really help JJ when he needed it most,"" he says. While he was grieving, JJ called him ""day and night"" and the pair still rarely go a day without speaking.

JJ was also there for Alan when he finally received his long-awaited autism diagnosis last year. ""Nobody in my life was surprised but it was a relief to finally get it,"" says Alan. ""Suddenly it made so much sense why I'd struggled to make friends when I was young."" The pair have continued to support each other in their relationships, and when Alan remarried in 2017, JJ was best man.

""We have been the best man for each other at all three weddings. I'm an extrovert and JJ is an introvert, so I think I was a bit more enthusiastic,"" he laughs. ""JJ is so reliable; he's the most helpful person I've ever met. He is so generous and really goes out of his way to make life better for the people around him. Being on the spectrum, I don't have to worry about censoring myself around him and can always relax.""

JJ says that although they are ""opposites"" in some ways, such as their different political opinions, they've always remained close. ""He accepts me for being me and I love that he's always there, no matter what.""","Alan and JJ met on a playdate when they were children.

2024-02-01,"Australia 'on track' with climate targets needed to protect Great Barrier Reef, Labor tells Unesco","The Albanese government has claimed it is ""on track"" to have national climate targets that would be in line with keeping global heating to 1.5C in a report to Unesco on efforts to protect the Great Barrier Reef.

The federal and Queensland governments are trying to convince Unesco not to recommend the world's biggest coral reef system be placed on a list of world heritage sites in danger - with a decision due at a meeting in India in July.

Last year Unesco's 21-country world heritage committee followed recommendations from Unesco that Australia should submit a report by 1 February that would review progress against a list of concerns, including action on improving water quality, sustainable fishing and climate change.

Across 21 commitments previously made to Unesco to keep the reef off the world heritage ""in danger"" list, Australia was ""on track"" with 10, had completed nine and two more were ""in progress"", the government's report said.

On climate change, the world heritage committee had said Australia needed to strengthen its cornerstone Reef 2050 plan ""to include clear government commitments to reduce greenhouse emissions consistent with the efforts required to limit the global average temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels"", saying this would help limit the impacts of global heating on the reef.

Global heating caused mostly by fossil fuel burning is pushing up ocean temperatures. Coral reefs are one of the most susceptible ecosystems to global heating.

The Great Barrier Reef has suffered six mass bleaching events since 1998 and scientists are concerned that wave damage and flood plumes from two cyclones this summer could have caused further damage.

In the report, submitted to Unesco's World Heritage Centre in Paris on Thursday, the federal government said it ""commits to set successively more ambitious emissions reduction targets"" that would be ""in alignment with efforts to limit global temperature increase to 1.5C"".

The independent Climate Change Authority is due to submit advice later this year to the climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, on what Australia's emissions reduction target should be for 2035. Australia has already set a net-zero by 2050 target and a 43% reduction by 2030.

However, research from two leading scientists who contribute to the UN climate panel's global assessment of climate targets has suggested Australia would need to set a 2035 target of 90% to do its fair share of keeping global temperatures to 1.5C.

UN experts have been concerned for years that progress to reduce sediment, nutrients and pollution running into the reef's waters has been too slow.

The government said about $534m from a $1.2bn funding package up to 2030 would ""accelerate actions to meeting water quality targets"".

Queensland had not implemented its sustainable fisheries strategy by the end of 2023, as promised, and was still finalising a commitment to remove gillnet fishing from the northern third of the reef.

The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said: ""Labor is acting on climate change, improving local water quality, protecting our marine life, dealing with invasive species, and investing a record amount of money into reef programs.""

Unesco and its science advisers at the International Union for Conservation of Nature will consider the government's report before making recommendations ahead of the world heritage committee's July meeting in New Delhi.

On Friday the government will also release a strategy to restore and protect wetlands in the catchment of the Great Barrier Reef.","Albanese government claims it is ""on track"" to have national climate targets. federal and Queensland governments are trying to convince Unesco not to recommend Great Barrier Reef be placed on a list of world heritage sites in danger.

2024-02-01,How We Break by Vincent Deary review - look after yourself,"A psychologist offers practical advice for dealing with life's ups and downs

It is refreshing to read a psychology book intended for mainstream audiences that isn't trying to push you towards a particular goal; to achieve more, to work harder. Thanks to the rapid societal and technological changes of the past century, self-actualisation is now possible for more of us than ever before. As welcome as this might seem, self-actualising is hard work, and possibilities can quickly become standards that we fail to live up to. Consciously or unconsciously, our unlived potential can haunt us and provoke us to strive until we burn out.

In this book, the second in a planned trilogy, and a follow-up to 2015's How We Are, health psychologist Deary delivers a much-needed message: we have a finite capacity to meet the unpredictable challenges life throws at us. The concept of allostatic load (the wear and tear of chronic stress) crops up repeatedly. In chapter four we are introduced to Anne, a single mother struggling to look after her son and father while working as a probation officer (Deary's case studies are composites of patients he has treated in a fatigue clinic). Anne looks after everyone except herself. As her life becomes more difficult and complex, her ability to function is gradually eroded until she collapses into a state of chronic fatigue. During a course of psychotherapy she comes to understand the vulnerability that results from doing too much for too long, to the point that a few ordinary difficulties can tip you over the edge.

A particular strength of the book is the way Deary weaves between different schools of thought within psychology, philosophy and religion. The result is not merely a discussion of abstract ideas, but a collection of valuable observations about what it means to be human in the modern world, taking in biological, societal and economic realities. In chapter eight we meet Fred, a freelance editor in his early 30s who is chronically exhausted because of anxiety and panic attacks. We are shown how his anxiety (exacerbated by the Covid-19 lockdown) shrank his world to the size of his house, leaving him effectively a prisoner of his own state of mind. The process of reclaiming his life then proceeds gradually, one small step at a time.

The various chapters work as stand-alone essays and discuss very different questions. How do stories and narratives shape us? What is the difference between useful and destructive thinking? How do dysfunctional psychological processes like anxiety or anorexia come to possess us? What does it mean to have a healthy relationship with yourself? The resulting insights apply whether we have a diagnosable mental health condition or not.

How We Break might not be quite as resonant for people who have yet to meet some of the more punishing aspects of life, or tend to dwell too much in their comfort zones. This kind of existence can be accompanied by its own collection of psychological problems, of course. Human beings are essentially anti-fragile, meaning we do in fact become stronger when exposed to stress and difficulty. Many aspects of modern life have made it easier for us to insulate ourselves from difficulty, and we are only just beginning to see what this could mean for the mental health of younger people. Rather, this book is for those who have experienced too much, too early or for too long, whose reach has exceeded their grasp, who may be hypercompetent and yet have little to no self-esteem.

The third instalment of the trilogy will be called How We Mend. In the meantime, this book offers a cathartic meditation on just how difficult life can be. Although the concept of self-care has become an overused and sometimes unhelpful trope on social media, Deary makes a compelling argument as to the necessity of self-compassion. He leads us to a more humane understanding of our suffering and offers practical advice for navigating life's ups and downs with greater grace and equanimity.",A psychologist offers practical advice for dealing with life's ups and downs.

2024-02-01,"Global cancer cases to rise by more than 75% by 2050, WHO predicts","World Health Organization says lower-income countries will record the biggest proportional increases

Global cancer cases are predicted to rise by more than 75% by 2050, according to the World Health Organization.

Latest figures from the WHO's cancer arm, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, makes plain the growing burden of cancer, rising from 14.1 million new cases and 8.2 million deaths worldwide in 2012 to 20 million new cases and 9.7 million deaths a decade later. The IARC predicts there will be more than 35 million new cancer cases by 2050, an increase of 77% from 2022 levels, and that deaths will have nearly doubled since 2012 to more than 18 million.

The IARC said tobacco use, alcohol consumption and obesity were key factors behind the increasing incidence of cancer, as well as population ageing and growth.

It predicts that the highest-income countries will record an additional 4.8 million new cases in 2050, but lower-income countries will experience the biggest proportional increases in cases. Cancer mortality in the latter countries is projected to almost double.

""The impact of this increase will not be felt evenly across countries,"" said Dr Freddie Bray, the head of the IARC's cancer surveillance branch. ""Those who have the fewest resources to manage their cancer burdens will bear the brunt of the global cancer burden.""

IARC's global cancer observatory, which covers 185 countries and 36 types of cancer, shows that 10 types of cancer accounted for about two-thirds of new cases and deaths globally in 2022.

Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide, accounting for 12.4% of new cases and 18.7% of deaths. Female breast cancer is the second most common form, but while it accounts for 11.6% of cases, it causes fewer than 7% of deaths. Other major causes of death include bowel liver and stomach cancer.

Inequalities are particularly pointed in breast cancer. Women in lower-income countries are 50% less likely to be diagnosed than women in higher-income countries, putting them at a ""much higher risk of dying of the disease due to late diagnosis and inadequate access to quality treatment"", said Dr Isabelle Soerjomataram, the deputy head of the IARC's cancer surveillance branch.

One in 12 women in higher-income countries are diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime and one in 71 will die of it, the figures show. In poorer countries, only one in 27 women are diagnosed in their lifetime, but one in 48 will die of the disease.

Despite being entirely preventable, cervical cancer is the eighth most common cancer globally and the ninth biggest cause of cancer death, accounting for 661,044 new cases and 348,186 deaths. It is the most common cancer in women in 25 countries, many of which are in sub-Saharan Africa.

Responding to the figures, Dr Cary Adams, the head of the Union for International Cancer Control, said: ""Despite the progress that has been made in the early detection of cancers and the treatment and care of cancer patients, significant disparities in cancer treatment outcomes exist not only between high and low-income regions of the world, but also within countries.

""Where someone lives should not determine whether they live. Tools exist to enable governments to prioritise cancer care, and to ensure that everyone has access to affordable, quality services. This is not just a resource issue but a matter of political will.""

Dr Panagiota Mitrou, the director of research, policy and innovation at World Cancer Research Fund, said: ""Such startling figures ring global alarm bells on the huge inequalities in cancer incidence and mortality that exist across, and within, different countries.

""Now is the time to take this global crisis seriously if we are to turn the tide.""

Prof Solange Peters, the president of the International Cancer Foundation, said she deplored the widening gap in cancer care. ""It is alarming that a mere 5% of global cancer spending reaches countries with 80% of the cancer burden,"" she said.

""The development of more and more exciting cancer treatments reaches [fewer and fewer] people worldwide. While patients in high-income countries can live and be cured of cancer, those in underprivileged settings die painfully from the same disease.

""We must address this social tragedy and economic burden, preventing millions of cancer deaths through strategic investments. It's time to bridge the gap and save lives globally.""

Dr Jean-Yves Blay, the director of public policy at the European Society of Medical Oncology, said in anticipation of the ""tsunami"" of new cancer cases, there needed to be ""swift and decisive"" action to reduce pollution, exposure to asbestos and other carcinogens, mitigate behaviours that increase cancer risks and tackle obstacles and hesitancy to vaccination against preventable cancers.","Global cancer cases are predicted to rise by more than 75% by 2050, according to the World Health Organization.

2024-02-01,Shoaib Bashir to make England debut as Jimmy Anderson returns in India,"Spinner comes in to replace Leach for second TestAnderson made Test debut 114 days before Bashir was born

It is a case of something old, something new for England in the second Test against India after Ben Stokes named his team on Thursday, 24 hours out from the toss. Jimmy Anderson and the uncapped Shoaib Bashir come into the attack in Visakhapatnam, with Mark Wood and the injured Jack Leach stepping aside.

Having taken a second look at the surface at the ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium, Stokes is convinced the balance that delivered a 1-0 lead in Hyderabad remains the way to go. Not that the two changes made by the England captain and the head coach, Brendon McCullum, are straight swaps: Anderson's craft replaces the pace of Wood and Bashir, a right-arm off-spinner, turns it the other way from his Somerset teammate Leach.

Bashir, 20, is the latest injection of youth, having been born 114 days after Anderson, 41, made his Test debut in May 2003. It follows his late arrival on tour - a visa complication meaning he landed on the morning of England's fourth day victory in the first Test - but Stokes has no qualms about this immediate promotion. ""There's no worries and no issues for me that he's been away from the group for a period of time, then coming back in to make his debut,"" said Stokes at the pre-match press conference. ""It's not like he's forgotten how to bowl.""

This recall for Anderson makes it a 22nd successive year of Test cricket for England's record wicket-taker and a chance to move closer to 700 victims in the longest format. He sits just 10 away from a mark only previously breached by Shane Warne (708) and Muttiah Muralitharan (800), with his hunger seemingly still burning bright despite a low-key Ashes summer in terms of the wickets column.

Stokes said: ""Bringing Jimmy's experience, the class that he has, is great and I think it also goes under the radar how good his record in India is [34 wickets at an average of 29, economy rate of 2.65 runs per over]. Considering what Jimmy is known for - 'the swing king' and all that - it just proves how good a bowler he is. He has different skill sets that I will be able to exploit in Indian conditions. It's not just for the new ball, it's the other stuff he possesses as well. Lots of people should look up to Jimmy considering he is where he is at 41.""

For all of Anderson's 183 caps' worth of experience, the loss of Leach to a knee injury makes it a green frontline spin attack for this match beyond Joe Root, now playing as an all-rounder. Rehan Ahmed is two Tests to the good and Tom Hartley one. But the 6ft 4in Bashir, who becomes the 99th England player since Anderson made his bow at Lord's all those years ago, will certainly have the support of his captain.

Stokes added: ""The thing he possesses is that natural ability, where he releases the ball from, how much energy he tries to put on the ball. Someone releasing the ball from height and putting that much on the ball is going to get that natural variation. That is very hard to play against out here. Some balls will skid, some will skid on. I'm fully backing him and looking forward to him going out on the field, hopefully putting on a ground show.""

2024-02-01,Ed Davey apologises for his role in Post Office Horizon scandal,"Lib Dem leader, who was business minister from 2010 to 2012, says he is sorry he 'did not see through Post Office's lies'

Ed Davey has apologised for the first time for his role as a minister in the Horizon scandal, with the Liberal Democrat leader saying he was ""sorry I did not see through the Post Office's lies"".

Writing in the Guardian, Davey, whose business minister role from 2010 to 2012 involved oversight of the Post Office, said officials had initially advised him to not meet Alan Bates, who led the campaign into the unjust targeting of post office operators.

""The Horizon Post Office scandal is the greatest miscarriage of justice of our time, and I am deeply sorry for the families who have had their lives ruined by it,"" Davey wrote.

""As one of the ministers over the 20 years of this scandal, including my time as minister responsible for postal affairs, I'm sorry I did not see through the Post Office's lies - and that it took me five months to meet Alan Bates, the man who has done so much to uncover it.""

Davey has been repeatedly targeted by Conservative MPs since the return to the headlines, sparked by an ITV drama, of the unjust accusations against more than 900 branch owner-operators, over losses blamed on fraud that were in fact down to the faulty Horizon IT system.

He had previously said only that he felt ""regret"" over his role, saying he had been misled by a conspiracy from Post Office managers, and stressed that he was the first minister to meet Bates, albeit some months after Bates first asked.

Davey wrote: ""The Post Office is owned by the government but not run by it, so the official advice I was given when I first became a minister in May 2010 was not to meet Mr Bates. He wrote again urging me to reconsider, and I did then meet him in October.

""But he shouldn't have had to wait. When Mr Bates told me his concerns about Horizon, I took them extremely seriously and put them to the Post Office. What I got back were categorical assurances - the same lies we now know they were telling the sub-postmasters, journalists, parliament and the courts.""

While Davey is among a string of ministers who had responsibility for the Post Office in the period since the Horizon scandal began in 1999, he has faced significant political and media targeting, primarily from the Conservatives, which the Lib Dems believe is a factor of the party's targeting of dozens of Tory-held seats.

He had, however, been criticised for declining to apologise. An Opinium poll for the Observer last month found Davey's personal rating had taken a hit, although it did not seem to have affected the Lib Dems' overall polling.

On Wednesday, when he asked a question at prime minister's questions for the first time in several weeks, Davey was loudly barracked by Tory MPs, in a sign the Conservatives still think this is fertile ground for them.

In his Guardian article, Davey argued that the Horizon scandal was a symptom of a wider ""broken system"", one that made major institutions such as the Post Office ""almost a law unto themselves"".

He wrote: ""It may shock you that, even though the Post Office is owned by the government, there aren't any MPs or ministers on its board. Instead, a single civil servant sits on the board.

""We owe it to the victims of this appalling scandal not just to overturn their convictions and pay fair compensation - though do that we must - but also to prevent anything like it from ever happening again.""",Lib Dem leader says he is sorry he 'did not see through the Post Office's lies' Ed Davey was business minister from 2010 to 2012. he has been repeatedly targeted by Conservative MPs since Horizon scandal.,"[('davey', 0.3182), ('lies', 0.2924), ('mps', 0.2862), ('lib', 0.2792), ('sorry', 0.2687), ('dem', 0.2538), ('minister', 0.2222), ('scandal', 0.2219), ('post', 0.1995), ('ed', 0.1961)]","davey, lies, mps, lib, sorry, dem, minister, scandal, post, ed",56
2024-02-01,Tory justice minister Mike Freer to quit as MP over safety fears,"Mike Freer says incidents including death threats means he will not stand in his London constituency at next election

A minister has described how he escaped David Amess's killer by a ""stroke of luck"" after announcing he will not seek re-election over fears for his safety.

Mike Freer, the justice minister and Conservative MP for Finchley and Golders Green, said ""a constant string of incidents"" including death threats, abuse and narrow escapes had led him to decide to stand down at the next election.

In the latest incident, Freer's constituency office was the target of a suspected arson attack over Christmas. Two people have been charged. Freer, who represents an area with a large Jewish population, has been an outspoken defender of Israel.

Tributes to Freer have poured in since he announced his decision to stand down in an interview with the Daily Mail on Wednesday night.

On the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Freer described how he narrowly avoided an encounter with Ali Harbi Ali a month before he murdered the Southend West MP Sir David Amess.

""He'd been to Finchley several times. He told [the police] that he'd come to Finchley on 21 September 2021 - I remember the date vividly - armed with the intention to harm.

""And purely by a stroke of luck, the night before, Boris Johnson had moved me from the whips' office to courts and equalities. Otherwise I would have been in Finchley and probably attacked.""

Asked what the police had advised him to do while going about his duties as an MP, Freer said: ""You just have to be aware of your surroundings. So when you park your car, just make sure there's no one hanging around. When you approach the office, people quite legitimately could be waiting to see you. Always make sure you keep a distance. Always make sure the office is well lit, the CCTV is working, the panic buttons are there.

""If you do a public event, always make sure you have an exit that you can run to behind you, in case someone comes at you from in front. It's all that kind of awareness that becomes engrained."" He also decided to purchase a stab vest.

Asked whether he was being targeted because he represents a constituency with a large Jewish population, Freer said: ""I can't draw any other conclusion ... The level of abuse I get standing up for my constituents on antisemitism and on Israel has to be a factor.""

The Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, told ITV's Good Morning Britain he was ""really saddened"" that Freer had decided not to seek re-election. ""We all get death threats but Mike really has been targeted,"" Hoyle said, revealing that he had received one himself last Friday. ""The fact that MPs have these threats is totally unacceptable.""

Laura Trott, the chief secretary to the Treasury, told GB News that Freer's decision was ""incredibly sad"".

""Mike Freer is a brilliant minister and a great man and he made a huge contribution to British life,"" she said. ""We need to change the way that politics is conducted in this country so that people can air opinions without fear of harassment and intimidation.""

Karen Pollock, the chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, said on X that Freer was a ""champion for our community. This should not be the consequences of public service.""

Freer told the Today programme: ""When you get a constant string of incidents, some of which threaten your life, there comes a point where you say enough is enough.

""MPs - we kind of sign up for it, we take it on the chin, particularly the lower-level stuff. But it's not fair on our families and when our families feel the pressure, we really do have to evaluate whether we should continue.""",Mike Freer says he will not stand in his London constituency at the next election.

2024-02-01,'It was forced': grieving parents unfazed by sorry tech CEOs at US Senate hearing,"Many parents held up images of the children who died after falling prey to abusers on apps such as Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat

Mark Zuckerberg apologized to the parents of children who killed themselves after being subjected to online sexual exploitation during a US Senate hearing Wednesday. Evan Spiegel offered condolences to parents whose children obtained deadly illegal drugs via Snapchat. The words were too little, too late for their intended audience, though. The grieving guardians expressed only frustration with the social media CEOs' responses to their plight and to questions from members of Congress.

""I'm not happy with the answers the CEOs are giving. They can't give a straight answer. Not even 'yes' or 'no,'"" said Tammy Rodriguez, the mother of Selena Rodriguez, who was 11 when she died by suicide three years ago after being solicited for sexually exploitative content by strangers on Instagram and Snapchat.

Dozens of mourning parents attended Wednesday's senate judiciary committee hearing, Big Tech and the Online Child Sexual Exploitation Crisis, many of them holding photographs of the children who died after falling prey to abusers on platforms such as Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat.

""I am disgusted listening to them. All I care about is the kids are protected and the companies are held accountable,"" Rodriguez said.

Toney Roberts' daughter Englyn was 14 when she killed herself after viewing harmful content on Instagram, including a video of a mock hanging. The video is still on Instagram more than three years after Englyn's death. Roberts showed it to the Guardian.

""It is hard being here,"" said Roberts, who had travelled from Louisiana to attend the hearing. ""[The CEOs] are not answering the questions. The longer these companies are allowed to operate like this, the more children will get hurt. Something needs to happen now.""

Executives in attendance were Meta CEO Zuckerberg, Snap CEO Spiegel, the X (formerly Twitter) CEO Linda Yaccarino, the TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew and the Discord CEO Jason Citron. Members of Congress questioned them for four hours, which became heated on several occasions.

At the start of the hearing, each CEO gave a speech that outlined their position on their company's competence in protecting children online. Zuckerberg drew criticism from the parents for using his opening remarks to deny any relationship between social media usage and declines in mental health.

""The existing body of scientific work has not shown a causal link between using social media and young people having worse mental health,"" Zuckerberg told the crowded room.

Lori Schott, a bereaved mother from Colorado, said she cried when she heard Zuckerberg's comments.

""They lack a moral compass; it is profits over the kids. Where there's money, there's greed,"" she said.

Schott's daughter Annalee was 18 when she died by suicide. According to Schott, Analee's mental health deteriorated after consuming content on depression, anxiety and suicide that was recommended to her on TikTok and Instagram.

""She even saw a live suicide on the 'For You' page on TikTok. You can't unsee that. It ate at her internally,"" said Schott.

In the culmination of a tense exchange, Josh Hawley, the republican senator, invited Zuckerberg to apologize to the parents of victims in the audience, many of whom held photos of children they say died or suffered because of his platform. Zuckerberg stood up to face the families and offered his condolences.

""I'm sorry for everything you have all been through,"" he said. ""No one should go through the things that your families have suffered and this is why we invest so much and we are going to continue doing industry-leading efforts to make sure no one has to go through the things your families have had to suffer."" In response to Laphonza Butler, a Democratic senator, Spiegel later said, ""I'm so sorry that we have not been able to prevent these tragedies.""

Yet Zuckerberg's words seemed hollow to John DeMay, whose 17-year-old son Jordan killed himself in 2022 after falling victim to a scam soliciting him for sexual images over Instagram.

""The apology was forced,"" said DeMay. ""It doesn't mean anything. It's not going to bring my son back.""","Mark Zuckerberg apologizes to parents of children who died after online sexual exploitation.

2024-02-01,Bank of England leaves rates on hold as Bailey hails 'good news',"The Bank of England has kept interest rates on hold for the fourth meeting in a row while policymakers pushed back against expectations of imminent rate cuts.

The decision means the Bank Rate remains at a post-financial crisis high of 5.25 per cent, a level reached last August.

Six members of the nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) backed a hold, while two - Catherine Mann and Jonathan Haskell - favoured a further 25 basis point hike.

Swati Dhingra, the MPC's most dovish member, opted for a cut. This is the first time an MPC member has voted for a cut since the pandemic.

The Bank removed any references to hiking rates further, noting inflation has ""fallen back relatively sharply"" over the past few months, but gave no timetable for cuts.

Commenting on the decision, Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank, acknowledged the ""good news"" on inflation over the past few months.

However, he said ""we need to see more evidence that inflation is set to fall all the way to the two per cent target, and stay there, before we can lower interest rates"".

The Bank was forced into aggressively hiking interest rates over 2022 and 2023 as it sought to quell a sudden burst in inflation which was fuelled by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Inflation peaked at over 11 per cent back in October 2022.

Since then, inflationary pressures have eased prompting markets to start considering when interest rates might be lowered.

Inflation ended 2023 at four per cent, significantly below where the Bank thought it would be in its November forecasts. Then, the Bank predicted inflation would only have fallen to 4.6 per cent.

The MPC noted that recent falls had been ""broad-based, reflecting lower fuel, core goods and services price inflation"".

Reflecting the fall, markets now think that the Bank will start lowering interest rates in late spring with a further four cuts priced in for 2023.

The MPC said it would ""keep under review"" how long Bank Rate would be kept at its current level.

""Monetary policy will need to remain restrictive for sufficiently long to return inflation to the two per cent target sustainabily in the medium term,"" it said.

Services inflation and wage growth, both of which the Bank have flagged as indicators of domestically generated inflation, have also come in below the Bank's forecasts.

Progress on these fronts was noted, but the MPC still sounded a note of caution. ""Key indicators of inflation persistence remain elevated,"" the statement said.

The risk of persistent inflation could be seen in the Bank's inflation forecasts. Although it suggested falling energy prices would help inflation touch two per cent in the second quarter of this year, it would then pick up again in the second half.

The forecasts, which are based on market pricing, show that inflation will remain above target in two years time reflecting ""the persistence of domestic inflationary pressures, despite an increasing degree of slack in the economy"".

The MPC also flagged the risks stemming from ""geopolitical factors,"" such as the disruption to global shipping from Houthi attacks in the Red Sea.

The decision comes just a day after the US Federal Reserve left rates on hold again. Fed chair Jerome Powell pushed back against market expectations on when rates cuts will begin, warning a March cut was ""not base case"".

The European Central Bank (ECB) also left interest rates on hold last week.",The Bank of England has kept interest rates on hold for the fourth meeting in a row.

2024-02-01,"Deutsche Bank slashes 3,500 jobs in £1.4bn cost-cutting effort","Deutsche Bank is set to cut 3,500 jobs in an attempt to save €1.6bn (£1.4bn), as the bank has reported a fourteen per cent drop in profits.

The bank is understood to have about 6,000 employees in London out of over 90,000 globally, meaning if job cuts were spread evenly, the UK would see around 230 jobs eliminated.

It has not disclosed in which region the jobs will be cut.

The cost-cutting programme, which has already seen €900m in savings since it was announced in 2019, has also weighed on net profit, as the firm spent €566m throughout the year on restructuring and severance expenses. It expects to spend almost €400m more next year.

The new phase of the programme will see the 3,500 roles, mostly in non-client-facing areas, eliminated.

Net profits for the bank fell to €4.9bn in 2023, which it credited to ""higher income tax expenses"".

Deutsche Bank chief executive Christian Sewing praised the firm's performance in an ""uncertain environment"", highlighting that the firm had achieved a pre-tax profit of almost €5.7bn, the highest in 16 years.

""Cost discipline remains a high priority,"" he added.

In the bank's new targets for 2025, it said it would aim to achieve revenues of €32bn, while operating with total costs of about €20bn.

The bank also planned to dish out large dividends to shareholders, giving €0.45 per share, a 50 per cent increase from 2022.

""Our ambition is to be able to pay a dividend of one euro per share for the financial year 2025,"" Sewing said.","Deutsche Bank is set to cut 3,500 jobs in an attempt to save €1.6bn (£1.4bn) the bank is understood to have about 6,000 employees in London out of over 90,000 globally.

2024-02-01,Trump's data protection case dismissed by English court,"The former US president's High Court lawsuit against British corporate intelligence consultancy was dismissed by a judge today in London.

The defendant is Orbis Business Intelligence, founded by former government intelligence professionals Christopher Steele, who previously ran the Secret Intelligence Service's (MI6) Russia desk, and Christopher Burrows.

Donald Trump's claim concerned a dossier which was published by BuzzFeed on its website on 10 January 2017, under the headline'These Reports Allege Trump has Deep Ties to Russia. Mrs Justice Steyn pointed out today that this is the third case to come before this court about this dossier.

The timeline of the case dates back to June 2016 when Orbis was engaged by Fusion GPS, a consultancy

based in Washington DC, acting on behalf of US law firm Perkins Coie, to collect and provide intelligence concerning any Russian efforts to influence the 2016 US Presidential election and any links that might exist between Russia and Trump.

Orbis produced 16 pre-election memorandas, while Steele also provided two of the memoranda to the Federal Bureau of Intelligence (FBI).

They were also disclosed by Steele to Strobe Talbott, a former US deputy Secretary of State, a UK national security official, and David Kramer, an aide to then Senator John McCain.

BuzzFeed published the article on the dossier which included two of the memoranda. In one of the other lawsuits the judge noted, it was established Kramer gave BuzzFeed access to the dossier. An English judge held that that Orbis was not responsible for publication of the BuzzFeed Article.

It was noted in the judgement today that Trump accepted that Orbis is not responsible in law for the publication of the memoranda by BuzzFeed.

In December 2022, Trump's City-based lawyers, Level Law, sent Orbis and Steele a letter of claim with the intention to pursue a claim against them over breaches of the UK GDPR and DPA 2018.

However, it was then agreed that Steele was to be removed as a defendant and Trump's data protection claim was going to be just against the company.

Orbis has UK law firm Bristows on for its defence.

Last October, the English court heard arguments for two applications, one was for Trump to amend his claim form; while Orbis applied for an order striking out his claim form and particulars of claim on the grounds that they disclose no reasonable grounds for bringing the claim.

Today, the judge refused Trump's application to amend his claim form and she ruled that Orbis is entitled to a summary judgement.

She ruled that the claim should be summarily dismissed.

The judge did note: ""It is important to emphasise that the defendant has not contended that the claimant would have no real prospect of establishing at trial that the personal data complained of is inaccurate. The claimant's evidence is that the allegations are 'wholly untrue'"".

""I have not considered, or made any determination, as to the accuracy or inaccuracy of the memoranda,"" she added.

Trump also brought proceedings against Orbis and Steele (and about 30 other defendants) in the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida back in 2022 but the US court dismissed the case. Trump is currently appealing that decision.

Orbis was contacted for a comment and Level Law was contacted for Trump's comment.","Donald Trump's High Court lawsuit against British corporate intelligence consultancy is dismissed.

2024-02-01,Ainsley Harriott: TV freed me from racist London kitchens,"Ainsley Harriott tells Adam Bloodworth about kitchen racism in the 1980s, living with the memes and his new cookery show about Malta

Britons are spoiled for TV legends: Lineker for footy, Hammond for brekky, and the resurgence of Winklemen as girlboss on The Traitors. But none offer the singular IV drip of joy that is Ainsley Harriott.

Beginning his career as the guest cook on BBC's Good Morning with Anne and Nick in 1995, Harriott went on to make his name presenting Ready, Steady Cook until it went off air in 2010. Then, over the past half decade, videos of him farting about on TV in the nineties have made him arguably more famous than he ever was, reaching international audiences as one of the most memed British celebrities. T-shirts with the chef grinning read ""give your meat a little rub""; others reference the ""hello Jill!"" frying pan sequence from morning TV, and there are tens more endearing homages that have now trickled down to the children (heck, probably grandchildren) of the ones who watched Harriott on daytime TV.

""There's nothing in the script that says 'Ainsley you should do a dance here,' or 'you should do something there,'"" he tells City A.M. ""I never know. I just go into a situation and there's a nice moment. People who watch my programmes know that I'm a little bit different.""

Growing up in Balham, south London, to parents born in Jamaica, his mother was a cook and his father worked in entertainment. But it was his mother's influence that lit the fuse for the hip gyrations on Ready, Steady Cook that now pervade digital culture (and T-shirts around the world.) ""I like to add a bit of my mum into it,"" he says of his style.

""Bless her, she's gone many years now but she would be stirring something and her shoulders would go, or her hips. She used to make bread for us, and sprinkling the flour, she would say 'go on Pudda', which is what she called me, and I would throw it in the air and we would look at each other and laugh. I've got that in my DNA. I never know when I'm gonna start doing a dance.""

One video on TikTok entitled ""The day our lives changed forever"" features Harriott thrusting a frying pan in the direction an elderly lady called Jill's face - it has racked up over two million views; another captioned ""hehe boi"" of that famous meat rubbing scene has over 1.2 million. ""All the memes, you can't do anything about it,"" reflects Harriott. ""Other people make you a meme. You can't say, 'I'm going to be a meme now.' A lot of people don't even know me for the cooking, they know me for the memes. When I was out in Malta someone came up and said Oh, you're the meme guy.' You can't do anything, you just smile.""

Harriott pauses. ""Do you know what, they all have a smile, and that means more to me than anything else. It makes them happy. All you've got to do is look at breaking news every half hour. It pops up on your phone and you get depressed, you know.""

The latest attempt by Ainsley Harriott to have us in stitches (and maybe learn something about cooking) is an ITV show about Malta, airing on ITV and ITV Player from 5 February. In the show Harriott meets Maltese locals to learn about the country's heritage and cuisine. He hangs out with potato farmers, cafe owners, and some of his old friends who have been living on the island for three decades.

He has said he wants to slow down with the workload, but shows like this one ""stimulate your mind."" One trend he observed in Malta that is happening worldwide is the weakening of inter-generational kitchens; how younger generations, with the advent of the internet and endless possibilities, don't want to work in their family's restaurant anymore. In the UK, Chinese restaurants and Indian restaurants are shuttering because the kids, understandably, don't want to work the backbreaking hours their parents did.

""Maybe it's something to do with the internet, people can see how you can change and what's achievable and they don't want those handcuffs on. They want to be free to explore and open up their minds. I think a lot of people don't necessarily want to follow in their mother or father's footsteps. It's just the world, we're changing, and the pace we're changing at is phenomenal.""

The racism was pretty bad - people didn't want a black head chef in their restaurant, they just didn't want it. I don't know what it's like now but I don't think it's fantastic. There's a few of us who have broken the mould and been on TV

One upside, reckons Harriott, is that kitchens are becoming more diverse. There's another: innovation. He says of the likes of Deliveroo and the diversity of the London food scene: ""The stuff that comes every day, delivered to the door, is amazing.""

Before TV Harriott worked in fine dining kitchens during the 1980s, notably at the Westbury Hotel in London. But he experienced racism when he looked for work and says kitchens would be up-front about it. ""I was vibrant, energetic, enthusiastic, but places would just say 'We don't want a black face in the kitchen'. It was totally obvious and you just had to deal with that.

""It was pretty bad - people didn't want a black head chef in their restaurant, they just didn't want it. I don't know what it's like now but I don't think it's fantastic. There's a few of us who have broken the mould and been on TV, encouraging a younger generation. We hope when someone walks in they'll look at their ability to run a kitchen as opposed to the colour of their skin. Yeah there was a bit of racism but there still is a bit of racism - that's what I'm saying. It's not about me, it's about the people who come after. ""

He says of the chance to move into TV: ""An opportunity came along and I grasped it."" Combining his mother and father's skill-sets, the presenter began to ""feel quite free. I fitted into a little slot. Maybe I came along at the right time. On a live TV programme there's nowhere to hide, it's there, bang, in your face.""

Harriott has two children, both in their twenties, and lives in Wandsworth. The day we speak, he apologises for calling me late. He'd popped to the supermarket and the ""lovely people of Wandsworth"" had stopped him for photos as they often do. He'd learned years ago that when you live inside a family's TV set you are part of their lives, and he feels you should honour that.

The Ainsley Harriott we see on TV isn't a far cry from the real man, then - or at least the version of him he puts on display in supermarkets in south-west London. ""I like giving out positive energy. It'd be boring if we were all the same. If you bring something different to the table it's because you are different, it's because you are that person, and I like that, I like that connection. I like what I am. ""

2024-02-01,Square Mile and Me: Gareth Banner,"Each week we ask a City figure to take a trip down memory lane. Today, Gareth Banner, managing director at The Ned, talks history and hospitality in the Square Mile.

My first job was a paper round. I delivered the (incredibly heavy) weekend papers around the Wentworth Estate in Surrey. I don't know what was harder, getting up at 6am or having to drag myself up the vast driveways but it was nice to know I was bringing the news to the doors of people like Nick Faldo and Bruce Forsythe.

Like many in hospitality, I started working in the kitchen of a pub when I was 17. It was cramped, busy and extremely hot but the food was excellent and I was earning a handsome £7 an hour! It really ignited my passion for the industry.

After working in the pub, I decided to make a last minute change in my course at university to hospitality and business management. This gave me the opportunity to spend a year working for Marriott International in America. It was an internship that involved cross training in various departments which was great exposure and really opened my eyes to the business of hospitality. The lessons I learnt during that time have always served me well throughout my career.

I think the City of London is so handsome. There is so much great architecture and history throughout and much of it remains underappreciated. Even though there are more people visiting now than ever before, there are still many undiscovered landmarks and historical facts that give the City its identity.

I especially love that the origins of The Ned London are from a bygone era but we've been able to re-purpose the building in a way that many people today don't realise that it wasn't always designed to be a hotel.

I'd allow black cabs to pass through Bank junction without the current restrictions that have been imposed. We have to make the City as accessible as possible which sadly is not currently the case.

Amazingly, none that I'm aware of at this moment. However, I will say there are many City customs and traditions that take a bit of getting used to. I've enjoyed taking time to understand what the livery companies do as well as the role of the Lord Mayor.

Being a 'dad' to my two daughters is the proudest job title I could have.

I'm fascinated by creators and adventurers who set out to be the first to achieve something that many doubted was possible or had even thought of.

Overall I am and in many ways, I have a duty to be positive given my leadership responsibilities.

We're going to Lutyens Grill at The Ned London for a 'four hands dinner'. We're really excited about The Rare Tour which is a residency/takeover happening from 19-22 February with El Capricho from Leon in Spain. Family run, the restaurant has been ranked the fifth best steakhouse in the world and the food their farmhouse produce is in a different league to anything I've tasted before.

I'll take you to 🔶🟥🔵 (A bar with shapes for a name) on the border of Hoxton and Haggerston.

Most weekends I can be found playing taxi driver and ferrying my girls around. I do make an effort to try to get out on my bike with friends for a hard ride around London's parks.

Anywhere by the water. Nothing is more relaxing to me than staring out to sea or across the lakes.

Band of Brothers - few series are worth watching more than once but this certainly is.

The Connor Brothers. I think their work is so witty.

Surprisingly for someone who works in hospitality, I don't drink coffee.","Gareth Banner, managing director at The Ned, talks history and hospitality in the Square Mile.

2024-02-01,European inflation edges down to 2.8 per cent as ECB rate cut speculation mounts,"Euro area inflation fell to 2.8 per cent in January, down from 2.9 per cent in December, as markets speculate when the European Central Bank will begin to cut interest rates

The data came after a sharp uptick for the continent in December, when inflation rose from 2.4 per cent from November to 2.9 per cent due to a phasing out of German energy subsidies.

Last week, the ECB voted to keep interest rates at their highest level in 22 years, stating that it would ""ensure that its policy rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary"".

It is expected that the central bank will begin cutting rates in the spring, but ECB president Christine Lagarde said rate cuts were not on the table yet at a press conference following the decision.

Today's data revealed that in January, food, alcohol and tobacco inflation remained the driving force of higher prices on the continent, with prices rising 5.7 per cent over the last year, down from 6.1 per cent in December.

This was followed by services, which saw the rate of price increases unchanged from December at four per cent, non-energy industrial goods at two per cent, and energy at -6.3 per cent.

Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, eased for the sixth straight month to 3.3 per cent, its lowest level since March 2022.

Across the continent, annual inflation rates were highest in Estonia (five per cent) and Croatia (4.8 per cent), while Finland (0.7 per cent) and Italy (0.9 per cent) took up the rear.

Michael Field, European market strategist at Morningstar, said the figures were ""a welcome downward move"", especially the fall from the ""usually stickier"" core inflation.

He added: ""Record high interest rates in the eurozone have had the desired effect, driving inflation down in 12 of the last 13 months, so today's fall should come as no real surprise.

""Granted, we are still not at the ECB's targeted two per cent level of inflation, but with the momentum we have witnessed over the last year, that goal is well within sight.""","Euro area inflation fell to 2.8% in January, down from 2.9% in December.

2024-02-01,Manufacturing downturn continues as optimism at four-month high,"The UK's manufacturing sector contracted again in January, while business optimism jumped to its highest level in four months, a closely watched survey has suggested.

Manufacturers saw increasing supply chain difficulties as the ongoing Red Sea crisis, involving Houthi rebel attacks on commercial shipping, triggered the re-routing of deliveries away from the Suez Canal.

S&P's global UK manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) came in at 47.0 in January, up from 46.2 in December but lower than the 47.3 ""flash"" estimate from the middle of last month.

The figure remains below 50.0, the threshold separating growth from contraction.

Four of the PMI's five sub-components showed trends signalling overall contraction, with the index suggesting a deterioration in operating conditions for 18 straight months.

Total new orders kept falling last month on weaker demand both home and abroad, while new business was hit by weak customer confidence, order cancellations and client destocking.

New business placed with UK manufacturers fell for the ninth month in a row, with companies reporting that the country's weak economic backdrop, as well as poor weather, was hitting demand.

The continued decline in output and new orders resulted in more job losses and lower levels of purchasing and stock holdings.

""The ongoing weakness is leading to an increasingly cost-cautious approach at manufacturers, compelling cutbacks in purchasing and stock holdings as companies aim to achieve efficiencies, protect cash flow and defend fragile margins,"" said Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence.

He added: ""Cost and stock management initiatives are being complicated by the Red Sea crisis. Diverting purchased inputs, especially those sourced from the APAC region, around the Cape of Good Hope is raising prices and extending supplier lead times.""

Business optimism rose to a four-month high, which S&P said reflected new product launches and expectations of economic rebound.

""One small ray of light from the January data is manufacturers expect some of these issues may be temporary, with an increasing number (over 50 per cent) still forecasting output to be higher 12 months out,"" Dobson said.","S&P's global UK manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) came in at 47.0 in January.

2024-02-01,Insolvencies rise helps Leonard Curtis back into the black,"The rise in company insolvencies across the UK helped Leonard Curtis back into the black during its latest financial year, new documents have revealed.

The restructuring and recovery group made a pre-tax profit of £806,550 for the 12 months to April 30, 2023, having made a loss of £276,569 in the prior year.

Leonard Curtis also posted a turnover of £29.2m for the year, up from £17m.

The Manchester-headquartered group has offices across the North West, Scotland, Yorkshire, North East, West Midlands, South East, South West, London as well as Guernsey and Jersey.

A statement signed off by the board said: ""The restructuring and insolvency division has seen an increase in revenue from £14m to £15m; a full year of Leonard Curtis South Coast Limited has contributed to £2.8m of the growth.

""The remaining increase has been through organic growth and the UK restructuring market coming back following the withdrawal of pandemic-related government support, UK inflation and rising energy costs.

""The results from the legal services division were strong for the period and reflected a buoyant M&A market for the corporate team and internal referrals from our restructuring and insolvency division.""

The statement also added that the ""division has seen an uplift in revenue from £1.7m to £2.5m; this is through organic growth and a key hire towards the end of the year under review"".

""The results in funding were above budget and expected after a full year due to the return of SMEs requiring funding as they come out of the pandemic and access to government-backed funding was phased out,"" it continued.

The results come after The Office for National Statistics revealed that the number of company insolvencies has soared to its highest level since 1993, as voluntary liquidations reached the most since records began in 1960.

Throughout 2023, there were over 25,000 company insolvencies, with every category of insolvency rising compared to the year before.

However, the record is in absolute terms: as a proportion of registered companies, the rate is 53.7 per 10,000 firms, compared to a peak of 94.8 in the 2008 global financial crisis.

On its future, Leonard Curtis added: ""The group continues to seek to grow its market share by way of geographical expansion and by reviewing the potential growth within the offshore market and by acquisitions - within all three pillars of the business, the group has access to significant levels of capital as a result of the transaction on August 23, 2021.

Daily Mail and General (DMG Media) and News Corp UK and Ireland (NewsUK) proposed a joint venture last October which would combine the printing operations of NewsUK and DMG Media printing sites in Thurrock, Essex and Dinnington, South Yorkshire.

This proposal would create a new company which would run the combined print operations. This new company would operate independently, with its own senior leadership team drawn from NewsUK and DMG Media.

The merger has been cleared by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission a month after it was announced.

Today, the CMA has given ""notice pursuant to section 96(2A) of the Enterprise Act 2002"" as it considers this transaction in relation to competition laws.

2024-02-01,TSB Bank proposes £120m payout for owner amid record profits,"TSB Bank has recommended a £120m award to its Spanish parent company as it reported a jump in annual profits on the back of high interest rates, despite a rise in impairments amid ""economic uncertainty"".

The high street lender previously paid a £50m dividend to Banco Sabadell last February following record profits.

Numbers came in even stronger last year, with a pretax profit of £237m for the full year, jumping 29 per cent from £184m in 2022.

However, the bank set aside £68m to cover bad loans, up nearly a quarter (24 per cent) from the previous year, which itself saw a 54 per cent rise from 2021.

TSB said the higher impairment charges were mainly tied to ""the full release of Covid-19 related provisions throughout the year"".

Meanwhile, consumer lending dropped 4.7 per cent to £36.2bn, while deposits fell 4.3 per cent to £34.8bn as the bank dealt with fierce competition in the deposit and mortgage markets, alongside customers squeezed by the cost-of-living crisis.

TSB notched a four per cent rise in net interest income (NII) to £1bn - reflecting the difference between what the firm pays out and receives in interest - on the back of the Bank of England hiking borrowing costs to a 15-year high.

The lender noted how this figure was partially offset by ""lower mortgage margins in a highly competitive market"". Its worst-case scenario estimated house prices could fall as much as 18 per cent this year.

Chief executive Robin Bulloch said: ""In the face of continued economic uncertainty and the prospect of a prolonged period of low economic growth, TSB will remain committed to executing its strategy, simplifying the business to reduce costs, and supporting customers, providing them with solutions that genuinely meet their needs and deliver good outcomes.""

Club L London, which was founded in 2007, also achieved pre-tax profits of £4.6m for the year, up from £2.7m.

A statement signed off by the board said: ""Club L has seen exceptional growth since its launch and continues to see revenue, profit, customers and orders increase year on year.

2024-02-01,"How Alex Jones, Will Mellor and Jasmin Harman are helping Cotton Traders target millennials","Cotton Traders, the clothing brand founded by two former England national rugby union captains, has turned to the power of celebrity to help target a younger audience.

Traditionally seen as a retailer more focused on an older demographic, the Altrincham-based company has recently signed up the likes of actor Will Mellor, broadcaster Alex Jones and A Place In The Sun star Jasmine Harman in a bid to appeal to Millennials.

The pivot comes after the business, which was set up by Fran Cotton and Steve Smith in 1987, posted a turnover of £111.4m for 2022, up from the £100.7m it achieved in 2021. Its pre-tax profits also rose from £10m to £10.3m. Its accounts for 2023 are expected to be filed with Companies House by the end of September.

As well as a hoped-for revenue boost, Cotton Traders will also see a year of change on a corporate level as its parent company edges closer to a $1.6bn merger which will see it list on the New York Stock Exchange.

'Key celebrity figures have strengthened our position'

Cotton Traders' chief marketing officer Shona Jameson said: ""Over the past year we have invested heavily into our celebrity ambassador strategy to maximise brand awareness and reach a new, younger demographic.

""Our partnerships with key celebrity figures have strengthened our position on social media with credible, authoritative content and a cross-fertilisation of followers.

""Our ambassadors, TV star Will Mellor, broadcaster Alex Jones and A Place In The Sun star Jasmine Harman, have successfully elevated Cotton Traders' awareness and relevancy.

""Not only do they look fantastic in our clothes and help to increase the quality and appearance of our collections, their public profiles have elevated our press relations and brand perception.

""Each of our ambassadors has been carefully selected to bring a different quality to Cotton Traders, each with their own style and personality, to appeal to different audiences and demographics.""

Shona Jameson added: ""Our male ambassador Will Mellor, has wide appeal with both men and women. This is particularly important as our data shows that 45 per cent of our female customers are also purchasing our menswear product so it's vital that we're reaching both audiences.

""In addition, Jasmine Harman has been chosen to fit our colourful summer ranges and unique patterned collections, and Alex Jones' well-known national profile has helped drive customer consideration for the brand, whilst conveying the quality of the clothing.

""As part of our strategy, we selected partners who felt authentic and representative of our brand, and this has been evident through the celebrities posting organic content in real-life moments, outside of their paid deliverables.

""We have seen increased new customer acquisition, with prospective customers and prolonged customer retention.

2024-02-01,Belfast is beautiful but its peace walls convey the scars of brutal recent history,"The scars of the Troubles are visible in the physical barriers that divide Belfast's citizens in two, writes Lucy Kenningham

Every evening in Belfast, gates at the interface barriers on the Shankill and Falls roads are shut by 6pm. A wall that is three times higher than that which divided Berlin still separates the citizens of Northern Ireland by religion. Certain other gates along the line are closed at 7pm (Townsend St) and 10pm (Lanark Way) - interested parties can head to Reddit for the full compilation of closing times.

Residents can still find their way around the imposing structures but these walls are a powerful symbol of the enduring division and fear literally dictating the geography of the city.

No wonder, you could say. Most people in Northern Ireland remember at least part of the 30-year long conflict during which over 3,500 people died - half of these being civilians. The battle between Republicans, who want a united Ireland, and Loyalists, who want to remain part of the UK, was formally ended only in 1998.

The scars of the Troubles, which were so called due to the tradition of saying ""sorry for your troubles"" to the deceased's kin at a wake, run deep. Northern Ireland has a 25 per cent higher rate of mental illness than England and one of the highest suicide rates in Europe.

So Northern Irish folk still live amongst the walls. The very first of these were temporary and constructed in the 1920s, but most were built after 1969 at urban interface areas in Belfast. Unlike the Berlin Wall, which was a singular line cutting the city in half, on a map Belfast's walls are haphazard strikes and dabs. And crucially, unlike Berlin, the walls were not torn down, symbolically, when the conflict ended.

To the contrary. The walls have only increased in number and height since the peace agreement in 1998: in the early 90s there were some 18 partition walls; in 2017, there were 59. They have been erected in the places that are most vulnerable to violence - 67 per cent of deaths during the sectarian violence happened within half a kilometre of a now-standing wall.

These days murals illustrate many of the concrete interfaces, representing scenes from the Troubles from either side of the dispute. Black taxi cabs take tourists around, for a very modern (and moving) urban history tour.

Should the walls be brought down? Eventually, yes. But residents of Belfast are not clamoring for their removal - rather, they see them as a safety device.

Belfast is not the only city dividing its citizens: Mostar, Jerusalem, Nicosia and Mitrovica all have walls up too.

What is striking about Belfast's is how incongruent they are with the rest of the UK. For it remains a strange reality that even history buffs living in England or Wales can go through the entire education system without ever having learned a thing about Northern Ireland, the other Ireland or the very recent conflict known as The Troubles.

The curriculum cannot, of course, contain every interesting period of history. But to fail to mention the most recent armed conflict on UK soil, one that was only formally ended in 1998, seems like a pretty gaping omission. Especially when the political consequences are still so rife today (and we could probably do with a little bit less around WW2 and rationing).

The brutal truth is that the UK's neglect of Northern Ireland in its education system speaks to a wider English attitude to the province (and also compounds it). Last year Yougov found that 60 per cent of the English public did not care whether Northern Ireland remained part of the UK or not.

Yesterday's news that a new post-Brexit agreement has finally been reached is welcome: it should boost the Northern Irish economy and restore the Stormont executive, ending a two-year boycott destabilising the country. But the gates on the peace walls will continue to close and open, and tourists will continue to visit and marvel at the fact that in one of the world's most open and liberal countries, a physical wall exists to cut a city into sections.",Belfast's walls are a powerful symbol of the enduring division and fear.

2024-02-01,Phoenix hits targets early as growth in annuities pays off,"Pensions giant Phoenix Group has hit its 2025 target for long-term cash generation two years early after seeing strong growth across a number of its divisions.

In a trading update, Phoenix said its new business long-term cash generation, a key measure of future profitability, was around £1.5bn in 2023.

""This means we have achieved our 2025 new business long-term cash target two years early, reflecting the focus and investment we have put into our growth strategy,"" boss Andy Briggs said.

The firm reported that net fund flows were up to around £7bn in 2023, a roughly 80 per cent increase on the year before.

Workplace net fund flows nearly doubled year-on-year to reach around £4.5bn, with a large part of this coming from the transfer of the Siemens workplace scheme.

Phoenix also saw growth in its Retirement Solutions business, driven by deals in Bulk Purchase Annuities (BPA). Phoenix completed seven BPA transactions in the second half of last year, covering around £2.8bn of premiums.

Through its Standard Life brand, Phoenix has also been ramping up its activity in bulk annuities -- where insurance firms buy company-defined benefits, or final salary and pension schemes -- as demand for corporate pension insurance deals grows.

The firm said its strong performance reflects ""clear strategic focus and investment into growth"", which has been accelerated by a ""supportive economic environment"".

The firm will announce its full-year results on 22 March.","Pensions giant Phoenix Group has hit its 2025 target for long-term cash generation two years early.

On Wednesday, the billionaire asked his nearly 171m followers on X: ""Should Tesla change its state of incorporation to Texas, home of its physical headquarters?""

Of those who voted, over 87 per cent said 'yes', leading Musk to say, in a separate post, that ""Tesla will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation to Texas.""

The governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, posted in support of Musk. He wrote: ""Elon, it's over. The election desk is declaring a landslide victory for Texas.""

It comes a day after a judge in Delaware ruled that Elon Musk's $56bn (£44.2bn) Tesla pay package is excessive, describing it as ""an unfathomable sum,"" before striking it down.

The package allows Musk heavy discounts on stock options provided a number of financial and operational goals are met.

In response, Musk said: ""Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.""

2024-02-01,AG Barr: Former cruise chief takes the reins at UK fizzy drinks giant,"The former chief of over 50 insurance provider Saga has been appointed as the boss of AG Barr, the drinks giant behind the production of Irn Bru.

Boardroom heavyweight Euan Sutherland was named this morning by the Scottish firm, replacing longstanding chief Roger White who announced his departure over the summer.

Sutherland has held a number of senior roles at some of Britain's best-known brands, including Superdry and Kingfisher.

He stepped down as head of Saga last November after four challenging years that included the closure of its cruise business during the pandemic.

Sutherland said: ""I am very excited to join AG Barr, which has a unique heritage, strong culture and exceptional brands.

""I look forward to working with the Board and the wider business to continue to deliver significant value to shareholders, stakeholders and employees for the long term.""

Mark Allen, chair of AG Barr, added: ""It has been a great pleasure working with Roger, who has successfully led the business for over two decades and delivered significant value to shareholders, stakeholders and employees.

""We wish him well in the future. On behalf of the Board, I am delighted that Euan is joining AG Barr. He has substantial experience across several consumer-facing businesses and will be a strong addition to the Board.""

2024-02-01,BT: Openreach grows as business unit lags for Britain's biggest telecoms firm,"BT is showing shoots of growth, with total revenue up three per cent in the nine months ended December, after it added 432k Openreach customers in its most recent quarter.

Britain's largest telecoms company said it achieved revenue of nearly £15.8bn in the first three quarters of 2023, up from £15.3bn in 2022.

This was largely due to success in its Openreach division that connects homes and businesses across the country to the national network. Openreach saw a 34 per cent rise in take up

But BT warned losses broadband could surpass £400k this year thanks to ""ongoing weak broadband market conditions"". It has lost 369k year to date.

In its third quarter of 2023, overall revenue grew to £5.3bn from £5.2bn a year earlier. Growth in BT's consumer and Openreach businesses were partially offset by the business unit.

The telco giant said its business arm is still being hit by higher input costs, legacy declines and one-off costs from the previous year.

The company is currently trying to streamline BT Business by gradually cutting the amount of products it offers, such as its 3G service.

New chief executive, Allison Kirkby, said: ""BT Group has delivered another quarter of revenue and EBITDA growth, while rapidly building and upgrading customers to our full-fibre broadband and 5G networks, and we continue to be on track to achieve our financial outlook for the year.""

Today marks the first day that Kirkby takes up the top position at BT, replacing Philip Jansen.

2024-02-01,Infrastructure giant 3i Group boasts strong results thanks to Dutch discount retailer,"Infrastructure giant 3i Group boasted of a ""good result"" for the last quarter of 2023, thanks in large part to its largest holding, Dutch discount retailer Action.

The trust's net asset value per share grew from £18.86 to £20.34 over the final three months of the year, with this coming entirely from the value of its stake in Action, growing £910m over the three months.

Meanwhile, the trust's share price increased six per cent over the quarter but still sits on a massive 33 per cent discount.

In November, the trust surpassed £20bn in assets for the first time thanks to the rapid growth of Action, which it holds a majority stake in and now makes up 65 per cent of its assets.

In the company's quarterly results today, 3i Group sang the retailer's praises, putting it front and centre as Simon Borrows, chief executive of 3i Group, touted the retailer's ""impressive set of results"", starting 2024 with ""good momentum"".

The company also reinvested £455m in Action throughout the three months, while gaining £762m from it due to a capital restructuring.

However, among its other (much smaller) investments, results were more mixed, with few increasing substantially in value and at least three of its top ten investments, which make up 85 per cent of its holdings, shrinking over the three months.

""Macroeconomic conditions and global uncertainty are likely to continue to have an impact on selected names within the portfolio but we feel our unrelenting focus on good capital allocation means that 3i is well set for a strong return for the group for this financial year,"" Borrows added.","Infrastructure giant 3i Group boasts of a ""good result"" for the last quarter of 2023.

2024-02-01,Shell beat expectations and woo investors with £2.7bn share buyback,"Oil supermajor Shell's profits have beaten analyst consensus despite falling 29 per cent as asset write-downs and a slump in oil prices dampened investor returns.

This morning the company reported both its Q4 2023 results and the full-year numbers.

Adjusted earnings came in at $28.3bn for the full-year 2023 period, against $39.9bn in 2022, while for the fourth quarter the firm collected $7.3bn against $9.8bn a year prior.

The oil giant had been scoped by analysts to hit $27.5bn for the year.

Cash flow from operations (CFFO) was $12.6bn for the fourth quarter; and the total CFFO amounted to $54.2bn in 2023, the second highest year in the company's history.

Total shareholder distributions in 2023 amounted to $23bn, which is 42 per cent of CFFO but down $3bn on 2022 levels.

Total shareholder distributions in the fourth quarter amounted to $6.2bn, up from $4.9bn in the corresponding period last year, and comprising repurchases of shares of $4.0bn and cash dividends paid to Shell plc shareholders of $2.2bn.

Concerning buybacks, the firm announced a $3.5bn programme, which is expected to be completed by its first-quarter 2024 results -- due out by early May -- and an XX per cent dividend per share increase for the fourth quarter.

The company also announced it is increasing its dividend by 4 per cent.

The 2024 cash capital expenditure outlook range remains $22-25bn, as announced at the firm's Capital Markets Day last year.

The company first revealed the non-cash post-tax impairment for Q4 in December last year, driven by macroeconomic conditions as well as portfolio choices, including the Singapore Chemicals & Products assets.

Earnings from the firm's Renewable and Energy Solutions division fell drastically over 2023 against 2022 levels, with adjusted earnings falling 60 per cent and adjusted EBITDA dropping 43 per cent.

Owing to the firm's decision last year to axe the media Q&A aspect of their results reporting, journalists will not be able to put additional questions to Shell's senior leadership team.

Shell Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan said:

The Labour party leader will unveil his plan for business at the high-powered event in the City on Thursday, set to be attended by 400 business leaders, including FTSE 100 CEOs.

Starmer, who will be in conversation with the National Grid boss, will cite his ""guiding belief"" when he took over in 2020 ""not just that Labour could be the party of business, but that Labour should be the party of business, and now, four years on, Labour is the party of business"".

He will describe the ""depth"" of the transformation to the party's relationship with business as ""something I take immense pride in"", calling ""your presence a testament to the changes"".

Starmer will unveil his plan for business to deliver growth and prosperity across the UK, titled 'Labour's Partnership with Business for Growth'.

It will set out the framework for partnership with business and its role in Labour's five national missions.

""Today we launch this new plan, this new purpose, this new partnership with five priorities to unite behind,"" he will tell C-suite attendees, set to include Google, AstraZenaca and Goldman Sachs.

""Five steps we can take together to begin our walk towards a Britain with its future back.""

He will outline steps to get the UK building, boost skills, making work pay for working people, backing British business and creating the economic conditions required for growth.

It underlines Labour's key mission - to achieve the highest sustained growth in the G7 - as its central plank underpinning the focus of an incoming government, should they win power.

Rachel Reeves will also speak at the central London conference, where Iceland boss and former Conservative candidate hopeful Richard Walker will also be in the audience.

Earlier this week, Walker endorsed Starmer and Labour as ""the right choice for everyone in business who wants to see this country grow and prosper"".

The party unveiled their plan for financial services in City A.M. on Wednesday, which saw it broadly aligned with the Conservative's Mansion House pension reforms. However, former City minister Andrew Griffith hit out at the plan as ""dog food lasagne"".

Commenting on the business day, chief secretary to the Treasury Laura Trott said: ""Keir Starmer's record of making promises and then dropping them when they become inconvenient shows Labour will not provide businesses with the stability and certainty they need to invest.

""Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives will stick to our plan that is providing business with the certainty they need to grow, create jobs and deliver more prosperity and security for Britain.""","Sir Keir Starmer is set to tell hundreds of bosses at a landmark business summit.

2024-02-01,Klopp Liverpool exit shows the monster has to be fed - Ed Warner,"The ululations emanating from Anfield have amused fans of other clubs, but the media amplification of Jurgen Klopp's resignation at Liverpool should not bemuse us.

Data, we are told, will drive the club's search for a replacement manager, just as data determines what sport we can read about these days. No mind that, to steal from Gag Halfrunt in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, ""Jurgen's just zis guy, you know?"".

Four major trophies in Klopp's nine years leaves Liverpool tied with both Manchester United and Chelsea and trailing Manchester City's 13 over the same period. Where the stories of the first two have been the sacking of managers in times of disappointment - or even, in the case of Louis van Gaal, immediately after winning a trophy - Liverpool and City have both been able to spin personality and continuity.

Like many, I'm sure, I've been sucked into the media wailing and gnashing of teeth this past week in spite of my best intentions. One quote from Klopp stands out to accompany the hollow-eyed photos of him that have accompanied journalists' screeds of text: ""I had six press conferences a week for nine years. I can't wait for a moment when I don't have to do that.""

The monster has to be fed. We, the public, are that monster. Whether we are fed what we truly want or end up simply eating what we are given is altogether moot.

I'm a sports fan with eclectic tastes, football among them. I've watched with dismay the shrinking diversity of sporting coverage in the mainstream media. Two or three journalists will attend single matches for the same newspaper. Multiply their words by those devoted to pre-match pressers, profile pieces, transfer speculation and the dissection of clubs' ambitions and crises, and you can see how football has cornered the media market.

A piece in The Times this month bemoaned the ubiquity of Premier League coverage. His focus was too narrow though. It is football more widely that is sucking oxygen away from other sports. The women's game has exacerbated the problem for the have-nots. It is evident that the men's game has ceded no column inches to the women's. Tertiary sports are the ones that have suffered.

My own appetites are symptomatic of the problem. If, like me, a majority of sports fans follow football but their other tastes are minority ones, then the aggregation of the public's interests will point to an apparent demand for a lot of football coverage and little of anything else. If we all liked, say, taekwondo and bowls, then these would both command media attention.

As it is, there is a pretty tight list of sports whose supporter base necessitates some coverage, and a much longer list of those who must simply be grateful for any they can wangle.

This column enjoys a spike in readership whenever it leads on a big football controversy, even if my insights might simply be those of an analytical observer. I've no commercial imperative to dance to football's PR tune. How different that would be, though, if money was at stake.

A two-page profile piece with darts prodigy Luke Littler at the weekend brought this into stark focus, in which he cited his newly-acquired 1.1m Instagram followers.

""He looked confused when I ask if he knows much about Emma Raducanu. 'No,' Littler says in a way which makes it clear he has never heard of her.... 'Didn't she reach out to you?' Littler is nonplussed again.""

The interviewer makes clear that the young tennis star had been asked about Littler in a press conference. We should all take a step back and question why, on our behalf, a tennis correspondent should have asked Raducanu about darts, and why she should be expected to have a view, let alone to say (if she did indeed do so) that she would be in contact with Littler. Or is this simply feeding our own monstrous appetites?

Yeah but, no but

""In 2017 we had a congress, and I proposed term limits which came into the statutes. But the wording was so unclear that de facto we didn't have term limits, because after every change of the statutes any previously served terms wouldn't count. I didn't know that at the time. But that was done without the approval of congress, which is obligatory, and without approval from any other Uefa organ, which makes the provision invalid.""

Aleksandr Ceferin makes it clear as mud in The Observer why he might yet serve more than eight years as Uefa president. Read him and fume here.

It ain't over until...

If like me you enjoyed some VAR-less FA Cup football at the weekend, you'll be chilled by the news that a Belgian game is to be replayed because of a VAR error. I could point you to a number of different explanations, but Jürgen Klopp is mentioned in one I found, so in the interests of circularity here it is.

Reports of death greatly exaggerated

Within a few hours the West Indies had won their first test in Australia in almost three decades and England staged a record recovery to triumph in India. Red ball cricket dead? Not just yet.

2024-02-01,That's one in the bag! UK foodtech scale-up lists in... London,"Low-sodium salt manufacturer Microsalt will make its debut on London's Alternative Investment Market (AIM) this morning, using the ticker SALT, as it looks to capture a bigger share in the ""exponentially"" growing sector.

The company, mostly owned by London-based intellectual property investor Tekcapital, uses a patented process to make salt crystals that it says taste the same as table salt but with half the sodium.

The firm said it would have a market capitalisation of approximately £18.5m on admission to the AIM, which is a sub market of the London Stock Exchange.

Every listing, little or large, comes as a welcome fillip to a bruised and battered exchange which has struggled to keep hold of its blue-chips in recent years.

More than 30 £100m+ companies left the exchange last year.

Microsalt announced a successful fundraise of around £3.1m before expenses at an issue price of 43p per ordinary share.

Governmental pressure for healthier food products has boosted demand for reduced sodium products in recent years.

Microsalt was founded in 2018 and sells two main consumer products - SaltMe! crisps and salt shakers - in US shops and on Amazon.

It said on Thursday that its ""primary strategy"" was partnering with brands looking to lower sodium content in their existing and new food products.

Chief executive Rick Guiney said today's listing was ""an important step in our development and provides an excellent platform for growth"".

""London remains an attractive destination to raise growth capital. In our view, MicroSalt's success proves, despite challenging macroeconomic conditions, that London has the ideal financial ecosystem for innovative early-staged technology companies to raise capital and scale their business,"" he said.

2024-02-01,Sleeping with your boss? WWE scandal a reminder firms shouldn't tolerate it,"Will Cooling writes about politics and pop culture at It Could Be Said substack

The lesson for businesses from the WWE scandal is that the temptation to overlook the misbehaviour of powerful executives is not only immoral but unwise, writes Will Cooling

After a year of twists and turns worthy of WWE's own television, Vince McMahon helped open the New York Stock Exchange last Monday to celebrate WWE signing a multibillion worldwide rights deal with Netflix and welcome Dwyane ""The Rock"" Johnson to the board of directors of the promotion's new parent company TKO. But by Friday night, McMahon had resigned as TKO's executive chairman.

What happened in the inbetween days is a former employee, Janel Grant, had filed a devastating lawsuit against McMahon. It was already known that Grant and McMahon had been in a relationship, and McMahon had agreed a multimillion payment for her to not disclose details about the relationship upon her departure from the company. Indeed, it was this revelation and concerns that she had been mistreated, which had forced him to announce his first departure in 2022. But not until the lawsuit was filed did details emerge about McMahon's conduct during the relationship. The lawsuit builds a detailed case against McMahon, frequently quoting texts sent by him, and providing explicit details about how his alleged behaviour demeaned Grant. We see in McMahon's own words not just his own depraved sexual desires and misogynistic attitudes, but how entangled the business was with them, with him frequently boasting about sharing pornographic photos of Grant with workers, including using them to help renew the contract of one of his most famous performers. Indeed, the lawsuit alleges that McMahon even engaged in sexual trafficking, with McMahon accused of pushing her to have sex with other people within WWE.

Whilst not denying the relationship, McMahon has made clear that he will contest the lawsuit, and so it may ultimately be a jury that determines where the truth lies. But one cannot help but notice how flat-footed the response from WWE has been, despite the initial outline of these allegations having been in the public domain for 18 months and investigated by their previous board of directors. WWE's chief content officer and McMahon's son-in-law, Paul Levesque, had nothing to say at a weekend press conference other than he hadn't read the lawsuit and wanted to focus on the positives of an 'amazing' week for the company.

The lesson for businesses is that the temptation to overlook the misbehaviour of powerful executives is not only immoral but unwise. WWE wouldn't be in this mess if they had properly enforced corporate rules governing managers entering into relationships with their subordinates.

It is perfectly understandable that people find such rules overly puritanical, given that they involve HR in people's personal lives, but they are the best defence against sexual harassment. From a distance it is difficult to tell the difference between a relationship that is abusive or one that is merely inappropriate; having zero-tolerance on both is essential for the former to be averted, especially as often the power-imbalance in such relationships makes it very easy for the more senior staff member to turn what began as a consensual relationship into a coercive one.

Likewise, it is important to take real steps to empower workers so they can safely push back against inappropriate behaviour from a senior colleague, be it a woman being abused, or a man being asked to be complicit in such abuse. This is also why having some facility for anonymous complaints is beneficial despite the inherent risks, because when you have executives as powerful as McMahon was in WWE, people will always fear reprisals.

But given the cultural reach of WWE, a reach that is due to expand as it is carried worldwide to over 250m Netflix subscribers in 2025, we have to ask what it means for society that a man like Vince McMahon was permitted to wield control of a product that touched so many people, particularly as they were growing up.

A lawsuit isn't needed to grasp that WWE frequently featured sexist and racist depictions of women and ethnic minorities, whilst also presenting a masculine ideal - that was often brutish and boastful. The impact that watching hours of that programme had on the psyche of its viewers is a troubling thought, especially as the lawsuit has now laid bare just how lost McMahon himself was in lurid detail the power fantasies he had created.",Will Cooling writes about politics and pop culture at It Could Be Said substack.

2024-02-01,BAE Systems unveils AI military training programme,"BAE Systems is ramping up its innovation efforts, this time by being the first in its industry to create an AI-powered learning system meant to make military trainees ""mission ready sooner"".

In partnership with Cambridge-based and AI-powered tech scale up, Obrizum, the British defence giant has curated a platform that combines the arms of its current training courses into one - the iDigital Learning Environment (DLE).

The DLE utilises Obrizum's AI-powered ""adaptive learning"" technology to individually tailor virtual training experiences, curate data-backed feedback, and determine progress along the way.

""Technology changes as quickly as the threat does and this allows us to be more innovative than ever before to meet the needs of the digitally native students of today and tomorrow,"" Lucy Walton, head of Training for BAE Systems' Air sector, said.

""By harnessing technologies such as those delivered by Obrizum we can create the kind of immersive and engaging training environments our customers need and ensure training is a forethought, not an afterthought,"" she continued.

But how does the new system work? Through ""automation, adaptability and analytics,"" Obrizum founder and chief executive, Chibeza Agley, told City A.M.

It brings the worlds of classrooms, personalised learning, and simulation based training together into one ""galaxy"" of modules, he added.

It will rid the ""inordinate"" amount of manual labour that comes with ""old-fashioned"" ways of programmes and learning assessments, Agley said, while cutting unnecessary ""overhead"" costs, such as transport and time.

Agley praised the DLE's ""speed of competency,"" which he said is up to five times faster than traditional military learning courses.

The software also has the ability to detect if trainees are ""cheating,"" Agley said, making it ""impossible"" to ""guess your way through"" a training programme.

""That's a material impact on being able to get people mission-ready sooner,"" Agley said.","BAE Systems is the first in its industry to create an AI-powered learning system. the iDigital Learning Environment (DLE) combines the arms of its current training courses into one.

2024-02-01,"Off-peak Fridays sound fun, but Londoners will end up footing the bill","John Oxley is a political commentator and associate fellow at Bright Blue

The mayor's reckless promise of lower fare Fridays is a sign of more disingenuous politicking to come, writes John Oxley

While Westminster talks about when a general election might be, the London mayoral contest is speeding towards us. There are now just three months until the capital goes to the polls and the campaigning is kicking up a gear - with the giveaways and campaign pledges starting to emerge. With the race far from competitive, however, these campaign time bungs could just end up costing Londoners in the long run.

Incumbent and frontrunner Sadiq Khan has already unveiled two eye-catching pledges. First came a year-long freeze on pay-as-you-go fares for public transport, handily teed up to cover the election period. Then came a more innovative pledge to make Fridays 'Off Peak' only for the next three months. It's pitched as a plan to woo commuters back from working from home and to re-establish Fridays as the new Thursdays. As a three-month pilot, it's also fairly nakedly timed as a vote winner.

You can't doubt Khan's political instincts. Tube prices are one of the real giveaways a London mayor can offer, and it's shrewd to pitch this as a boost for business and commuters in a cost-of-living crisis. Yet once the election is done with it is Londoners who will end up paying the price of this largesse.

Fares are the major source of income for London's transport. When they are cut, it means later consequences for the Transport for London (TfL) budget - either with bumper rises in subsequent years, or shaving money off future investments. This is now more true than ever, with London's transport still suffering from the huge drop in income during the Covid lockdowns, and the longer reduction in demand as more of us moved to working from home.

This has been compounded with central government making Khan fight hard for any top-up funds from general taxation. In order to reach financial sustainability, TfL has already cut £500m from this year's budget. Fare cuts will make this harder to top up in future meaning long-term degradation of the service - with shoddier trains, degraded tracks and increased closures down the line. On top of this, the flashy new announcements will be pushed with a new round of TfL funded advertising.

It's easy, but irresponsible, politics to try to sway voters with such short-term bungs. This is especially true when the contest seems already over. Recent polls put Khan around 25 points ahead of Conservative candidate Susan Hall. With Labour riding high nationally, and the capital generally being to the left of the country, it would take a major shift in opinion for Khan to drop into second. He's hampering London's future transport investment for a political edge he is unlikely to need. That these latest giveaways come alongside another round of strikes is striking.

Khan is not the only one dealing in giveaways. Hall has made an overture to outer London by announcing she would scrap the Ulez extension, another source of funds for TfL. On a national level, the Tories started this year with a cut to National Insurance, and will likely slash more taxes in the run-up to the general election. There's almost no getting away from this easy retail politics.

Voters, though, should recognise that these moves come with other costs. Just as someone always has to pay for government spending, fare and tax cuts necessitate a drop in spending somewhere. The only hope to avoid politicians reaching for easy sops is for voters to become wiser about them, and be clear of the drawbacks when offered seductive inducements. Discerning voters should look beyond a springtime of cheap fares and think of the delays such discounts could incur in 2026.","London mayor's reckless promise of lower fare Fridays is a sign of more disingenuous politicking to come, writes John Oxley.

2024-02-01,Banks under pressure? Top MP: 'Going to have to get a smaller violin',"The UK's high street banks could have been forgiven for hoping for a quieter 2024 after facing regulatory and political pressure to ensure that customers got a fair rate on savings products last year.

Following pressure from the Treasury Committee, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) intervened over the summer, prompting high street banks to offer better rates.

All over? Not exactly.

Speaking to City A.M., Harriett Baldwin, chair of the influential group of MPs, said ""we will be going through the results with a fine tooth comb to see how much of that net interest margin they're passing on to our constituents"".

""We thought it was absolutely wrong every time the Bank of England raised the base rate, you would get a call from your mortgage provider to say your rates are going up. But if you had savings in the bank, you weren't seeing any movement at all in your savings rate,"" Baldwin said.

According to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the largest nine banks had only passed through 28 per cent of the base rate rise to easy access deposits between January 2022 and May 2023, although better deals were available on fixed-term deposits.

Following the Committee's pressure, regulators pushed lenders to offer savers a fair rate on easy access accounts. Consumers increasingly started shopping around too, looking for the best deals available.

In the final quarter of last year, the Current Account Switch Service saw its busiest quarter since its launch back in 2013.

Changing customer behaviour and regulatory pressure has started to hit banks' profitability. Analysts have warned that banks will face margin pressure in the coming year as customers shop around for better deals. Just this morning Santander reported that interest income was down £56m year-on-year.

Speaking to City A.M. last week David Postings, chief executive of UK Finance, said the hit to profitability had impacted lenders' attractiveness to international investors.

Baldwin was unmoved. ""I'm going to have to get a smaller violin,"" she said.

A UK Finance spokesperson said: ""Savings rates increased significantly over the course of last year and there are a lot of good products available. We always encourage people to shop around for the product and interest rate that is suited to their needs"".

Baldwin also took aim at the pace of regulatory changes in financial services. The government announced a suite of changes in its Edinburgh Reforms package at the end of 2022 with the aim of reinvigorating the City, but Baldwin said ""progress has been quite slow"".

She described the package as a ""damp squib"" last year, although she stressed there were ""some important reforms in there"".

On the whole Baldwin supported the package, but her concern was the pace of change. The regulators could ""absolutely"" be moving faster, Baldwin said.

""Sometimes the regulators themselves don't agree on the direction of travel they've been asked to go on by the government. They will slowly, slowly, slowly drag their feet and implement these things as slowly as possible, hoping we'll all be gone and they can deal with someone else,"" she claimed.

Focusing on the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR), who appeared before the Committee on Tuesday, she said the regulator was dragging its feet on introducing new fraud protections for consumers.

""We couldn't believe how slowly they're going on these things...a lot of the time there will be lots of lobbying by those being regulated to slow things down"".

A PSR spokesperson said: ""We are driving forward a number of significant, complex pieces of work as quickly and effectively as we can to improve payments for everyone. This year will see the delivery of big changes we've been working on, including world-first consumer protections against APP scams going live in October.""","Financial Conduct Authority pushed banks to offer savers a fair rate on savings products.

2024-02-01,Revealed: Sadiq Khan's bumper New Year's Eve firework budget,"Approximately 12,000 fireworks were used during London's spectacular New Year's Eve display, which had a budget of almost four million pounds, City A.M. can reveal.

The Mayor of London's spenny ceremony to bring in 2024 was the biggest ever, with fireworks impressing a hundred-thousand revellers who lined the banks of the river Thames.

In a freedom of information request to the Greater London Authority, the Mayor's office said the ""budget available for the event was £3.85m, with additional costs being supported by ticket revenue of £1.75m.""

It said the authority ""does not hold the final costs for the 2023 event - these are still being reconciled"" and it was also unable to say what the most expensive individual firework was during the display.

During this year's event, police struggled to maintain order as non-ticket holders tried to rush into the area for official viewing of the event.

A spokesperson for the Mayor of London justified the nearly £4m budget for 12,000 fireworks, saying: ""London's spectacular New Year's Eve celebration brings more than 100,000 Londoners and visitors together on the banks of the Thames, while tens of millions watch around the globe.

""The event attracts huge numbers of tourists into London every year, and is a fantastic opportunity to showcase our capital at its very best - boosting our economy and providing an incredible global advert for our tourism industry.

""The fireworks are only a small fraction of the total budget, which has increased over the years to provide more stewards and enhanced security, as well as due to inflation.""

During the COVID-affected 2020/21 event, fireworks cost £1.5m, with 2022's costing £1,502,960.

The display to bring in 2023 had a spend of £3m, with £1.3m recouped through ticket sales.

Susan Hall, the Tories' mayoral hopeful who trails Khan in the polls, said: ""It is a shame Sadiq Khan has been too busy with his egotistical fireworks display, when he should have been dealing with the knife crime epidemic that has grown on his watch.""","Approximately 12,000 fireworks were used during London's spectacular New Year's Eve display, which had a budget of almost four million pounds.

2024-02-01,"Housing is a business issue, and nowhere more so than in London","Ask business leaders in private what's bothering them and the usual list is predictable enough: the markets, performance, getting the right team in place. Recently, we've heard a new one feature in more than a few conversations: whether London can keep its edge as the place to be for their talented young staff.

The capital is increasingly unaffordable for twenty- and thirty-somethings, as yesterday's house price affordability data demonstrates. As corporates have tightened their belts on pay-rises, rents and deposits have shot up. Our newspaper has lost not one but two talented staff members who simply wanted to head back home, rather than stay in the capital, so that they could buy a house.

Housing is a business issue, nowhere more so than in London. It's also a cost of living issue.

A radical reduction in the price of the roof above one's head - through house prices and rents stabilising whilst wages rise alongside - would be transformative for the UK economy. Firms would not be under pressure to jack up wages as swiftly as they are; employees would not be constantly looking around for a small jump elsewhere.

Above all else, London would become a more appealing magnet for global talent who are at the start of their careers, bringing the fresh ideas and enthusiasm which have been at the heart of our growing businesses for decades.

Whitehall has to take this seriously, as do other arms of government including the Greater London Assembly. Developers are desperately keen to fill the demand, as you'd expect: liberalising planning law and letting them get on with building sooner rather than later seems to us at least a no-brainer.

We have had enough warm words from the more than a dozen housing ministers we've had in as many years.

It is time for more considered action that gives the next generation a chance to get on the ladder in a place they actually want to live.","London is increasingly unaffordable for twenty- and thirty-somethings.

2024-02-01,GoHenry boss Louise Hill: I'd have loved to stay UK-owned - CityAM,"Each week Charlie Conchie interviews the biggest names in the world of finance and tech. This week he sits down with Louise Hill, the founder of kids' money-management business GoHenry, which was taken over last year

""I blame my kids,"" laughs Louise Hill from her office in Farringdon.

The founder of children's finance app GoHenry used to stick an invoice on the fridge every time her son landed a new iTunes bill in her inbox. When he went to collect his pocket money every weekend, he would find a chunk of it already spent.

""On Saturday mornings he stuck his hand out expecting £4 and I would go 'here's your invoices. Hope you're enjoying your music. But you've spent £3.20 on iTunes this week, so here's 80p'.""

At the school drop off, she would chat about her kids' covert spending habits and realised every parent was facing the same issue. One said her daughter had spent £400 on Mylittlepony scrunchies, another had a banged-up car delivered to the house after thinking he was buying a flashy toy for £600.

Kids, she realised, weren't equipped to understand the world of online spending - they needed both some guardrails and, crucially, some guidance. GoHenry began to take shape.

Hill, a retail specialist and consultant by trade, tapped into the uncertainty facing both parents and kids as they navigated a new world of online spending.

Founded in 2012, the firm had swelled to around two millions customers and had already stretched into the US when it was sold to Californian wealth fintech Acorns last year.

Despite that growth, however, she says the issue of financial education is still as pressing as ever.

""I think the simplicity of having money in my pocket and when it's gone I can see it, we've all lost that - and not just kids.""

The firm now offers both a core debit card for children and teens as well as financial education tools to educate children with saving and budgeting. With its new parent company Acorns, it is now also offering them a route to stay with the firm into adulthood.

The need for financial education has transformed Hill into something like campaigner-cum-boss at the helm of GoHenry, banging the drum for more work.

Despite the government putting financial education on the curriculum ten years ago, Hill says far too many are still falling through the gaps. She wants financial education to be compulsory and consistent across schools.

I think parents realised that they needed something to help their children manage money online and within limits, and that catapulted our growth

""There's a gaping hole [in financial education],"" she adds.

""Most schools don't have to follow the curriculum. Certain groups of church schools don't have to follow the curriculum. Any state school that's joined in the Academy system does not have to follow the curriculum.""

The gap in learning has been crystallised by the pandemic and cost of living crunch in recent years, she adds. Despite its world-beating financial industry, the UK ranks 15th out of 29 OECD countries for financial literacy. A Bank of England deepdive showed last year that even kids want to be taught how to better handle their cash.

That need has also been ""exacerbated"" by the pandemic, the Bank said, as timestrains and a lack of access squeezed financial education even further out of the curriculum.

For Hill and GoHenry, the times of economic strain have therefore proved a rather unwanted boon. Covid pushed parents and kids online and onto its app and revenues at GoHenry firm doubled in 2021.

""I think parents realised that they needed something to help their children manage money online and within limits, and that catapulted our growth,"" she says.

That growth set GoHenry up for its sale to Acorns last year for an undisclosed sum. While Hill could be forgiven for thinking 'job well done' after selling up, she's not entirely satisfied.

For many, GoHenry's sale to Acorns was a symptom of an issue in the UK's tech sector - another homegrown, high-growth business forced to look across the pond after failing to find the domestic backing it needs.

Would she have liked it another way?

""I would have loved for us to remain entirely UK,"" Hill admits for the first time.""I'm a staunch supporter of Team UK,"" she adds.

GoHenry's earlier funding rounds ""came relatively easy"" in the UK, she says, but the firm then fell somewhat into the well documented 'scale-up funding gap' plaguing UK' start-ups.

Acorns, however, has made a good partner.

""It sounds corny when I say this, but they talk like us. They're excited by the things we're excited by, they care about educating people.

""We're just so closely aligned.""

Hill is still well and truly hands on with the firm after the acquisition. Acorns and GoHenry are readying new products to launch across the UK and Europe, and she's just launched a new petition and campaign to make some noise around financial education.

While she may wish the firm was an entirely homegrown British success story - there may be another piece of advice in there for her customers: when the deal's good, take it.",Louise Hill is the founder of kids' money-management firm GoHenry.

2024-02-01,The Lilac Review launched to 'unlock' barriers facing disabled entrepreneurs,"A two-year independent review into the challenges facing disabled entrepreneurs has surfaced following concerns over a lack of support and opportunity within the community.

Backed by the UK Government, the Lilac Review -- similar in style to that of the female entrepreneurship-focused Rose Review -- will investigate the barriers disabled entrepreneurs face, who collectively account for a quarter of the UK's small business population.

Conversations sparked following Small Business Britain's Disability and Entrepreneurship report in March, which expressed the need for collective societal support and greater awareness of issues facing disabled entrepreneurs.

The report, in partnership with Lloyds Banking Group, uncovered that 60 per cent of disabled founders did not receive any support on their start-up ventures.

Small Business Britain, one of the leading support groups behind the launch, estimates the review will ""unlock"" £230bn in business turnover, as disabled entrepreneurs are said to only represent 8.6 per cent of UK small business turnover as is.

Victoria Jenkins, chief executive and founder of adaptive fashion brand Unhidden and co-chair of the Lilac Review, said: ""The contribution of the disabled community to society is so much higher than people are made aware of.

""To be able to help remove some, or all of, the barriers that are impacting us is a lifelong mission of mine and so many others.

""We are also worth more than what we can, or can't, contribute from a financial respect and I hope to highlight that as well over the next two years, alongside powerful and important voices in the community.""

The Lilac Review, once published, will include a ""call to action"" for a ""positive"" change in accessibility and inclusion, with a list of recommendations for support.

Minister for Disabled People and co-chair of the Lilac Review, Mims Davies MP, said it is ""paramount"" that disabled entrepreneurs receive the opportunity to ""succeed and thrive"".

She continued: ""I'm delighted to be co-chairing the Lilac Review, which will help us make sure the UK is the best place to do business and to be a disabled entrepreneur - where your ideas and endeavours will be supported.""","a two-year independent review into the challenges facing disabled entrepreneurs has surfaced.

2024-02-01,Deliveroo ties up Ann Summers for Valentine's Day delivery with a difference,"Raunchy Londoners can now get vibrators, massage oils, and other adult toys delivered to their doors at lightning speed, as part of a steamy new partnership between Deliveroo and the nation's best known sex shop.

With Valentine's Day quickly approaching, the mobile app best known for satisfying the needs of hungry Brits, is teaming up with Ann Summers to assist with another kind of craving.

This morning's development comes after a study by YouGov study showed that 39 per cent of the heterosexual women polled agreed they had felt disappointed by a partner on the romantic February 14th holiday.

But the London-listed firm said its drivers can now deliver an array of vibrating sex toys and other X-rated tools to a number of homes across the capital in just minutes.

The unusual move offers a speedy solution for those looking for last minute gifts or stuck with a date who is not totally satisfied with what they initially opened.

Unfortunately, only customers within the Vauxhall and Canning Town radius will be able to avail of the service as they are in close proximity to its rapid delivery site, leaving the rest of lonely hearts around the capital picking over a KFC Bargain Bucket.

Eric French, chief operating officer at Deliveroo, said: ""We're incredibly excited by 'Deliveroo Shopping' and its growth potential, ensuring we can bring as many high street products on demand to people's doors as possible.

""Ann Summers is an iconic British multi-channel retailer, much loved by individuals and couples across the country, and ahead of Valentines Day this year we're making it easier for customers to buy their products.""

Today's move forms part of 'Deliveroo shopping', a new scheme which founder William Shu first thrust into the public domain last November at a company capital markets event.

The takeaway champion has been trying to penetrate different markets for months, as Brits clamping down on takeaways bruised earnings. It previously announced a partnership with DIY retailer Screwfix which will launch over the next year.

2024-02-01,Regent's Park gardeners down tools in strike over pay,"One of the capital's most-loved natural spots will be left unattended today as Regent's Park gardeners go on strike.

Members of the GMB Union who work at Regent's Park are set to walk out over pay as industrial action spreads to other sectors of the economy during the cost of living crisis.

The workers who are employed by Idverde, a private contractor, will down tools for 24 hours.

The union said staff at the park were given less pay than gardeners at other Royal Parks, despite last year being awarded a prestigious award from BALI (British Association of Landscape Industries).

Anna Lee, GMB organiser, said: ""These highly skilled gardeners have won several awards for their work over the past few years.

""It's a shame their employer Idverde and the Royal Parks do not recognise it and pay them a pittance - less than colleagues working in other parks.

""They maintain these grounds for the benefit of all Londoners, but they now face the ugly prospect of being priced out of their own city.

""GMB is not likely to allow this to happen. GMB calls on Idverde and the Royal Parks to recognise and value these skilled workers and give them the pay rise they deserve.""

A spokesperson for Idverde said: ""We are disappointed by the action proposed by our colleagues at The Regent's Park. We continue with open, cordial and constructive discussions with colleagues and are still hopeful of a workable resolution.""

A Royal Parks spokesperson said: ""All staff working on The Royal Parks' outsourced grounds maintenance contracts and its other major outsourced contracts are paid, as a minimum, the London Living Wage. Other than this, the terms and conditions of staff employed by those contractors are decided by their employers. The only exception to this is fixed-term apprentices, who are paid National Living Wage while studying for a Level 2 qualification.""","Members of the GMB Union who work at Regent's Park are set to walk out over pay.

2024-02-01,Mark Kleinman: It's payback time in the debate over executive pay,"Mark Kleinman is Sky News' City Editor and the man who gets the Square Mile talking, He writes a weekly column for City A.M.

Like death and taxes, rows over boardroom pay are among life's perennial certainties. Could 2024 turn out to be a watershed year, though, in the debate over executive remuneration at the top of British corporate life?

This week, the Investment Association, whose members speak for £8.8trn in assets, wrote to the remco chairs of FTSE-350 companies to reflect the axiom that a Draconian approach to executive pay is having a deleterious effect on London as a listing destination.

In the letter, a draft of which I've seen, the IA acknowledges the now-commonly expressed view that to operate on level international playing field, FTSE companies need to be able to exercise greater discretion over the sums they award in long-term incentive share schemes, as well as their use of so-called hybrid plans which also incorporate restricted stock.

The IA would, it adds in the draft, be ""updating the principles of remuneration in 2024 to simplify them, ensure that they are supporting a competitive market and delivering the right outcomes for both shareholders and their underlying clients"".

Julia Hoggett, the London Stock Exchange chief executive who has been in the vanguard of calls for UK companies to pay executives more competitively, will no doubt be rejoicing: here is the trade association for fund managers, noted in prior years for its demands for restraint and desire to publicly embarrass those who attracted significant investor rebellions, effectively giving carte blanche to boards to pay their CEOs more like their US counterparts.

Remco chairs would be wise not to interpret that too literally; payment-for-performance and within the parameters of existing remuneration policies, will need to be policed.

Investors, though, appear to have heeded warnings that their more draconian approach during the last decade has had a detrimental effect on the London market and UK corporate competitiveness. Don't expect campaigners against high pay to congratulate them on their newly discovered liberalism.

Has there been a worse, more value-destructive corporate merger in Britain's financial services industry than that of Aberdeen Asset Management and Standard Life?

At the point at which the two companies came together, the combined group was worth £11bn and managed assets worth £670bn. Today, its market value languishes at £3.23bn and assets under management have shrunk to below £480bn, and the trajectory is dire.

Stephen Bird, the chief executive parachuted in in 2020 to arrest what could be best-described as the faltering performance inherited from predecessors Martin Gilbert and Sir Keith Skeoch, has made one big bet: the £1.5bn takeover of Interactive Investor, a deal intended to pivot abrdn towards the growth of retail funds supermarkets like Hargreaves Lansdown and AJ Bell.

That's now arguably the best-performing part of the group, although many shareholders argue that Bird overpaid for the business.

The rest of abrdn's businesses tell a sad story of decline, the only surprise being that the group is yet to attract a bidder prepared to break it up into the sum of its parts.

Indeed, Bird himself was reported by Financial News last year to have taken the idea of disposing of the institutional asset management arm to the abrdn board.

At the current rate of decline, the rejection of such a plan may have been a mistake. As other UK-listed players, such as Jupiter Asset Management and Premier Miton, are amply demonstrating, being a mid-sized fund management group in a sector confronted by the headwinds of higher regulatory costs and poor performance is deeply unattractive to investors.

Bird's latest cost-cutting plan, which I revealed on Sky News last week, ""barely touches the sides"", according to one industry executive. Removing 10 per cent of its workforce will leave it with about 4300 staff, less than half the number who worked for it in 2017.

Chairman Douglas Flint now has a key decision to make: back Bird's strategy, cut the dividend, and hope that a revamp of abrdn's senior investment team yields results; or gamble on a change of chief and a more radical break-up that would indeed prove that the merger with Standard Life was an unmitigated disaster.

It hasn't taken much of 2024 to elapse for the UK takeover disclosure regime to come back under the spotlight. I've long been a critic of the apparent inconsistencies which lie within the rules which dictate whether or not bid approaches for public companies should be formally announced.

In this latest example, American Industrial Partners had approached Serco, the £1.9bn outsourcing group which handles sensitive contracts for the government such as the operation of two immigration centres, about a possible bid.

The approach came late last year, and I understand that discussions had been ongoing until as recently as December.

That feels sufficiently current for shareholders to deserve a fuller official account of the situation from Serco, but under the Takeover Code, silence was permissible, because the talks were no longer active when news of them broke. Shares in Serco initially spiked, before falling again, reflecting investors' belief that the prospect of a deal had evaporated.

In that situation, a formal no-bid statement would have been more conducive to an orderly market. Sources tell me, though, that others are also circling Serco, so I may soon get the chance to complain about London's disclosure anomalies all over again.",Mark Kleinman is Sky News' City Editor and the man who gets the Square Mile talking. he writes that a Draconian approach to executive pay is having a deleterious effect on London.

While Labour's attempts to woo the business community have so far been distinctly long on aspiration and short on details, at least Rachel Reeves has now promised not to reimpose the cap on banker's bonuses that was finally removed by the Government last year.

Quite right too - the cap was imposed after the Financial Crisis in an appalling bout of gesture politics by the European Union. All it has done is drive up fixed costs for the entire financial services industry, which has had to increase salaries to compensate for reduced bonuses. Before you hear the cheers echoing through the City, firms have to figure out one thing. How do they now cut those increased salaries to restore proper incentive-based pay? Especially at a time when many parts of the financial sector are feeling the pinch.

Nation of compensation

Let's say at the outset that the proposed $56bn pay package for Elon Musk was extraordinary and indefensible. It should never have been approved by the Board and shareholders should have had the opportunity to vote it down.

That said, am I the only one who is a little uneasy about the enormous precedent of a US court voting the package? Remuneration should be a matter between a company, the employee, the company's Board and its owners (the shareholders).

Now that a judge has shown she can and will step in to block one deal, what will stop them intervening every time they feel someone is being overpaid, or perhaps even taking action retrospectively and ordering the well-heeled CEO to hand back some of his or her gotten gains? This opens a whole new front in the long-running battle over executive compensation.

2024-02-01,"Topsy Ojo: Six Nations pick, England fresh start and Italy relegation","The Six Nations is back after a Rugby World Cup last year where some expectations were exceeded and others weren't. But in the best annual international rugby tournament, which is celebrating 25 years since its expansion from the old Five Nations, everything is on the line and nothing can be taken for granted.

City A.M. spoke to former England international, London Irish legend and broadcaster Topsy Ojo about what each team can hope to achieve over the next two months.

ENGLAND

""It's a fresh start for England. This is a honeymoon period for the squad, look at the new and mature talent that's there. I am very happy to see a lot of the guys that have been picked.

""Can they get that balance right between what Steve Borthwick feels they need to do to win Test matches, but also allowing them to show everything that they've shown in their club shirts?

""I really like the squad. I like that there's some explosive players in there. It is a nice mix of experience and youth but how it is put together.""

WALES

""There's been some evolution for Wales and it's time for the next group to step up.

""What you might find is that on the back of the apparent idea that nobody believes they can do anything - people think they're going to finish fifth, or even get the wooden spoon again - they go out and prove people wrong.

""They'll say, 'let's go out and show them what we're really about'. Look at Dafydd Jenkins, their 21-year-old captain -- he will go and lead by example. And then you think about what that looks like not just this year, but then into year two and year three of the project, and the decision could be right to go young now.""

IRELAND

""Ireland will be interesting because there's an ongoing conversation about who's the next guy in line after the retired Johnny Sexton. Do they have those replacements ready?

""Andy Farrell is an exceptional coach. He would have thought long and hard, not just in the build-up to the World Cup but this whole time, about who is in line. It'll be interesting to see who he gives the reins to.

""When you consider the first game is away to France on Friday night; as exciting as that is, it is a tough place to go and start your Six Nations campaign, especially when you're trying to fill in from where Sexton left the shirt.

""But this is the game, isn't it? It's part and parcel of it. It's why if you're a fan. It's exciting.""

SCOTLAND

""For Scotland, it is the consistency. We will all ask the question of whether they can get three wins then four wins and then go on and win it.

""They need to build step by step with their talented squad. They have the capability to go out and do some special things but they need consistency week after week.

""Scotland give us things to talk about and they give us stories and narratives, but ultimately it is that opening weekend against Wales that matters. It will be interesting to keep an eye on Scotland, they're ones to watch.""

FRANCE

""I have them as slight favourites. Even though they're not playing at the Stade de France, wherever they go they'll be very well supported. The crowds will be ferocious.

""Obviously there's disappointment from the World Cup but they'll be looking for their team to bounce back. They're a squad with little turnover but still exciting faces.

""Antoine Dupont aside, a lot of that squad will still be there. [Dupont's deputy] Maxime Lucu has been brilliant as well and when he played in the World Cup he was exceptional. They've got depth and I wouldn't be worried about who's next in line in any position across the pitch.""

ITALY

""They can win a game. Italy is a funny one because when they click and they get it right, they do have a lovely style about them; they move the ball and they've got skillful players.

""But what they find is that ultimately, when push comes to shove, it doesn't always work.

""There's always this conversation surrounding whether they should be in the Six Nations but they're not going anywhere so let's try and put that to bed.

""They've got a really well balanced squad, some young talents and superstars, and they'll be looking at that first game at home in Rome against what will be an emerging England team and saying, 'right, if we want to lay a marker down, it probably needs to be in game one'.""","The Six Nations is back after a Rugby World Cup last year.

2024-02-01,Diary of a Lawyer: Domestic abuse and the family court,"'Parental alienation' is a disturbing tactic increasingly being used by abusers in family courts, writes Charlotte Proudman

Domestic abuse is a deeply pervasive issue in the lives of countless individuals, leaving behind a trail of emotional, psychological and sometimes physical scars. Within the intricate web of family court battles, a trend has emerged - so-called 'parental alienation - weaponised by abusers to perpetuate control and inflict further harm on their victims. There is an insidious intersection of domestic abuse and 'parental alienation' claims, which has become a tactic deployed within the family court system to the detriment of survivors.

According to UN special rapporteur Reem Alsalem, ""The tendency to dismiss the history of domestic violence and abuse in custody cases extends to cases where mothers and/or children themselves have brought forward credible allegations of physical or sexual abuse. In several countries, family courts have tended to judge such allegations as deliberate efforts by mothers to manipulate their children and to separate them from their fathers. This supposed effort by a parent alleging abuse is often termed ""parental alienation."" Claims of 'parental alienation' are often used by abusers to dismantle allegations of abuse and falsely paint victim-mothers as abusive.

'Parental alienation' was coined by Richard Gardner and supposedly involves one parent manipulating a child's relationship with the other parent through psychological tactics and emotional manipulation. In the context of domestic abuse, this can become a powerful tool for abusers seeking to maintain control over their victims even after the relationship has ended - and perpetrate post-separation abuse. It's not only the victim-parent who is harmed - instances of contact with abusers who've claimed 'parental alienation' has harmed children, and in some cases, child homicide has occurred under the current presumption of contact in the law.

The Ministry of Justice published the Harm Report in June 2020 which outlined that many mothers fear disclosing abuse because they may then be accused of 'parental alienation' and lose their children to the abuser. Which do you think most parents will choose - risk of disclosing abuse and losing your children to an abusive parent, or keep quiet and watch as your child regularly sees their abusive parent but lives with you? Many choose to keep quiet. As a family law barrister, I've seen this phenomenon countless times; one such case, Re GB [2023] EWFC 150, where I represented the mother, led to a successful appeal where the court's clarified that an expert psychological assessment to decide whether 'parental alienation' is an issue in the case was wrong. This decision aligns with the World Health Organisation and the American Psychological Association, who have never recognised the term as having evidence to back its use or existence, leaving the question to the courts.

Family courts play a pivotal role and should be centring the safety of survivors and children; however, many judges and court officials still lack sufficient domestic abuse training, allowing abusers to exploit legal proceedings to their advantage. Abusers may use various tactics in addition to claiming 'parental alienation' when the survivor-parent is displaying protective behaviour, such as raising costs or engaging in victim-blaming. These tactics can be especially damaging, influencing court decisions and perpetuating the cycle of abuse. Strengthening protections for survivors and implementing training programmes for judges and legal practitioners can contribute to a more informed and just legal process.

Addressing this issue requires a multifaceted approach, including legal reforms that increase awareness among family court professionals about the dynamics of domestic abuse and 'parental alienation' claims. By exposing the tactics employed by abusers and advocating for legal reforms, we can work towards creating a family court system that prioritises the safety and wellbeing of survivors and their children. A broader conversation must be sparked about the need for systemic change to ensure family courts become a haven of justice rather than an opportunity for further victimisation.","Domestic abuse is a deeply pervasive issue in the lives of countless individuals, leaving behind a trail of emotional, psychological and sometimes physical scars.

U.S. stocks saw a significant decline as the Federal Reserve opted to keep interest rates unchanged, dispelling hopes of an immediate rate cut by March. Meanwhile, oil prices rose slightly due to escalating tensions in the Middle East. Investors are closely monitoring the Bank of England's first monetary policy meeting of 2024, expecting the maintenance of rates at 5.25% at 1200 GMT. Later in the day, attention will shift to the market's response to earnings reports from tech giants Apple, Amazon, and Meta. Here are five key takeaways for your day.

China's Manufacturing Growth Driven by Export Orders: Caixin PMI

In January, China's private manufacturing sector expanded for the third month in a row, as per the Caixin PMI, while the official PMI indicated a contraction. Caixin's PMI remained steady at 50.8, meeting expectations, while the official PMI for January was 49.2. A reading below 50 suggests a decrease from the previous month. Caixin's PMI emphasizes small and medium-sized enterprises more than the official index.

UK Construction Sector Optimism Surges on Rate Cut Prospects: RICS

In late 2023, confidence in Britain's construction sector rose slightly, driven by expectations of interest rate cuts. A survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) indicated a more positive outlook for the coming year, with workloads increasing from 6% to 12%, Reuters reported. The survey found that 8% of respondents reported a decline in activity in the three months ending in December, an improvement from the 10% reported in the previous three months.

Oil Prices Inches Up Amid Rising Middle East Tensions and U.S. Fed Rate Signals

At the start of trading on Thursday, oil prices saw an uptick, driven by growing tensions in the Middle East, signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve hinting at potential interest rate cuts, and China's introduction of fresh measures to bolster its struggling property market. Brent crude futures rose by 46 cents, or 0.6%, reaching $81.03 per barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures increased by 47 cents, or 0.6%, hitting $76.33 per barrel. This rise follows a decline of over $2 per barrel in the previous session.

Reports emerged that the U.S. targeted multiple unmanned drones in Western Yemen, which were in the process of being readied for launch. This action occurred just a day after a deadly drone strike on a U.S. base in Jordan. The strike underscores the ongoing tensions in the Middle East, disrupting shipping routes in the Red Sea and raising concerns about delayed oil deliveries in Europe and Asia. Concerns about potential disruptions in oil supply were a significant factor supporting prices in January, marking the end of three consecutive months of declines.

What's Coming Up

The Bank of England is getting ready to unveil its decision on monetary policy later today. It's widely expected that they will choose to keep the key interest rate unchanged at 5.25% for the fourth month in a row. The decision is likely to be backed by a majority of 7-2 among policymakers. Economists speculate that while the Bank of England may acknowledge the swift progress in reducing inflation this week, they are unlikely to lower interest rates just yet. Governor Andrew Bailey will host a press conference at 1230 GMT.

Furthermore, there's a buzz around the corner for eagerly awaited earnings reports from major tech and tech-related companies. Apple Inc, Amazon.com, and Meta Platforms Inc are scheduled to report on Thursday. Notable reports also include General Motors Inc on Tuesday, Boeing Co on Thursday, and Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp on Friday, wrapping up the week.

However, the initial reports have not been promising. Following disappointing results from Microsoft and Alphabet late on Tuesday, all of the Magnificent Seven stocks were trading lower on Wednesday morning.

Apple: China iPhone Sales in Spotlight

On Thursday, Apple is poised to disclose its first-quarter earnings, offering investors valuable insights into its iPhone sales performance, especially in China. Projections indicate a moderate uptick in sales and a slight increase in earnings per share. The company's Services business, encompassing the App Store, iCloud, and Apple Music, is anticipated to be a significant driver of growth. Concerns surrounding the performance of the iPhone 15 in China prompted downgrades by Barclays, Piper Sandler, and Redburn Atlantic in early January. According to consensus estimates from Investing.com, Apple's earnings per share for the holiday quarter are expected to reach $2.10, representing an 11.7% improvement from the previous year. Revenue is forecasted to increase by 0.9% year-over-year to $118.3 billion, despite slowing demand for high-end smartphones and computers.

""Apple has the world's most valuable technology platform with over 1.2 billion users. While Apple is exposed to a weaker consumer and competitive risks in China, these factors are well understood, and we believe Apple's long-term outlook remains attractive given its technology leadership, sticky user base, and long runway to spend per user upside,"" noted Erik Woodring, Equity Analyst at Morgan Stanley.

""Catalysts to drive outperformance include 1) an underappreciated 'Edge AI' iPhone 16 cycle, 2) re-accelerating Services growth, 3) GM resilience, 4) new product launches (Vision Pro), and 5) a potential future hardware subscription/bundle offering, with longer-term investments in AI, payments, cloud, health, and home tools that can help sustain growth.""

Amazon: Eyes on AWS and Prime Ad Revenue for Potential Beat

Amazon is primed to experience a notable surge in both earnings per share and revenue, propelled by the triumphs of its cloud computing and advertising endeavors. Analysts project earnings per share of $0.79, showcasing a remarkable leap from the previous quarter, attributed to cost-saving measures implemented in recent months. Revenue is anticipated to increase by 11.3% year-over-year to $166.1 billion, underscoring the enduring prowess of its cloud computing and advertising segments.

""Amazon is benefiting from its Prime program, delivery and logistic system in thee-commerce space. Further, its dominant position in cloud market is a positive,"" said equity analysts at ZACKs Equity Research on reason to buy.

Meta Platforms: Focus on Ad Revenue Trends

Meta Platforms, previously known as Facebook, is anticipated to unveil one of its most lucrative quarters to date. Significant boosts in both earnings per share and revenue are expected, mirroring a revitalized digital advertising market. Analysts project a profit of $4.96 per share, reflecting an impressive 180% surge from the same period last year. Revenue is also forecasted to escalate by 21.3% year-over-year to $39.0 billion, signaling positive momentum in the digital advertising realm under the stewardship of Mark Zuckerberg.

The former Top Gear presenter is seen cuddling a teeny-tiny pig in promotional photos for the new season, as his farmhand Kaleb Cooper stands beside him.

Returning on 3 May, Clarkson's Farm will also see the return of all the other lovable characters, including Cotswold local Gerald, and the farm accountant Cheerful Charlie.

Press material suggests a shock for Kaleb though - a new arrival to the farm ""puts Kaleb's nose out of joint"". It's unclear who the new arrival is.

Still trying to make a profit from the farmland but struggling to make ends meet, Clarkson's Farm season 3 follows Jeremy Clarkson as he attempts to turn hundreds of acres of unfarmed land - woodland and hedgerows that make up half of Diddly Squat - profitable.

Clarkson's Farm has been a huge success since it first aired in 2021, with some commentators saying it has given the plight of farming some much-needed publicity. One farmer said the show had done in one season what ""30 years of Countryfile"" had achieved.

2024-01-31,Fed leaves rates on hold again but pushes back on rate cuts,"The US Federal Reserve has left interest rates on hold for the fourth consecutive meeting with policymakers suggesting they need ""greater confidence"" inflation is falling to target before rates can be lowered.

The decision means the federal funds rate will remain at a 22-year high, standing in a range of 5.25 to 5.50 per cent.

Although the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) dropped any reference to hiking rates further, it suggested markets would have to wait a little longer until rates would be lowered.

In a statement, the FOMC said: ""The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward two per cent"".

""The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its two per cent objective,"" it added.

Over the past couple of years the Fed has embarked on its aggressive monetary tightening campaign in decades as it sought to quell rampant inflation.

Having peaked at over nine per cent last summer, the most recent consumer price data from the US showed that the headline CPI index ended 2023 at 3.4 per cent.

The Fed's preferred measure of inflation, core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation, now stands at 2.9 per cent. When looking over the last six months, core PCE inflation is actually below the two per cent target, coming in at 1.6 per cent.

Falling inflation has fuelled bets that the Fed will start lowering interest rates soon. According to CME's Fedwatch, there is a near 60 per cent chance that the Fed will start lowering rates in its March meeting.

The Fed, like central banks all over the world, has been eager to push back against markets' optimism. It said that it would be guided by the data over the coming months.

""In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,"" the FOMC said.

Despite the Fed's rate hikes, the US economy remains remarkably strong. Recent figures showed that the US economy grew 2.5 per cent across 2023, an acceleration on 2022 and far stronger than European counterparts.

The Fed's decision follows the European Central Bank's decision to leave rates on hold last week. The Bank of England will announce their decision tomorrow, with markets expecting rates will be left on hold.",US Federal Reserve leaves interest rates on hold for fourth consecutive meeting.

2024-01-31,Former Autonomy boss sues SFO ahead of US fraud trial,"Mike Lynch, the former boss of software firm Autonomy, has filed a lawsuit against the UK's fraud agency ahead of his criminal trial in the US.

Lynch filed the claim against the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) at the High Court in London today and has appointed law firm Pallas Partners to represent him, according to an update in the High Court public claims system.

City A.M. understands the claim relates to a request for information submitted to the SFO under the Data Protection Act 2018 by Lynch.

Both the SFO and Pallas Partners declined to comment on the claim.

News of the lawsuit comes after the British entrepreneur was extradited to the US last year on fraud charges.

The charges relate to Hewlett-Packard's $11bn takeover of Autonomy back in 2011.

In 2022, Hewlett-Packard won a six-year civil fraud suit against Lynch after the High Court ruled that he defrauded the firm by manipulating Autonomy's accounts to inflate its valuation ahead of the takeover.

After Lynch lost the fraud lawsuit, the then-Home Secretary, Priti Patel, approved his extradition to the US, where he faces a total of 17 fraud charges related to the matter.

2024-01-31,Nicola Sturgeon accused of 'crocodile tears' at Covid-19 inquiry - CityAM,"Nicola Sturgeon has been accused of ""crocodile tears"" during her appearance at the official Covid-19 inquiry.

The former First Minister of Scotland gave evidence in Edinburgh today and became emotional as she told of being ""overwhelmed"" during the early days of the pandemic.

Sturgeon held back tears as she said a ""large part"" of her wished she had not been first minister when the pandemic struck.

""I feel to my core that the number of lives lost to this pandemic were far too high. We were never going to be able to get through a pandemic with no loss of life,"" she added.

But critics, including the Covid bereaved families, hit out at the former Scottish National Party (SNP) leader, who resigned in a shock move last year ahead of further police investigation into party finances, accusing her of faking her emotions.

Pamela Thomas who lost her brother, James Cameron, during the pandemic, said: ""Crocodile tears aren't washing with me.""

Thomas also criticised the inquiry for spending too long on the issue of WhatsApp, adding of Sturgeon: ""I don't think they're capable of actually telling the truth or being transparent.""

While Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar told reporters in Westminster there was a ""huge sense of betrayal"" among the public after Sturgeon's evidence at the Covid inquiry and accused the SNP of having a ""culture of secrecy and coverup"".

He said: ""I think there has been such a huge breach of that trust now, and such a sense of betrayal, that is going to rightfully anger so many people across the country.

Sturgeon also told the inquiry her main regret is that Scotland didn't lock down ""a week, two weeks earlier"" at the start of the pandemic.

The former politician insisted she did not use WhatsApp to make decisions and did not make ""extensive use"" of the messaging platform. Government in Scotland was ""open, transparent and accountable"", she maintained.

Sturgeon admitted she deleted her ""informal"" messages to others including now SNP leader Humza Yousaf, but that all ""salient"" points were recorded in official, corporate documents.

She apologised for any lack of clarity at a public briefing where she said her WhatsApps would be handed over despite knowing they had been deleted.

Current First Minister Yousaf, in his evidence to the inquiry last week, offered an ""unreserved"" apology for the ""frankly poor"" handling of requests for WhatsApp messages.

He has announced an external review into the government's use of mobile messaging.","Nicola Sturgeon tells of being ""overwhelmed"" during early days of pandemic.

Yet all of a sudden this week, a settlement was reached.

The Conservative MP George Freeman said this week that he quit his role as science minister last year because he could not afford his mortgage on the £118,300 salary. The basic annual salary for an MP is £86,584 and they also get living and travel expenses -- but should their pay be higher?

Ribeiro is a product of the Sporting Lisbon academy and made his professional debut in their Champions League game against Manchester City in March 2022. The deal with Forest has the option of becoming permanent.

Tom Allnutt: This season, Premier League spending has fallen off a cliff. For many clubs, the stagnation is borne out of fear as financial rules have started to bite. For the first time in a long time, the Premier League's supreme confidence in the transfer market has been checked.

* Read the reasons why the very biggest deals will have to wait

Martyn Ziegler, Chief Sports Reporter: Premier League clubs owe a total of £2 billion in transfer fees, with football finance experts suggesting that the rise of buy now, pay later deals has contributed to a big downturn in the number of signings in this window.

Clubs often spread out the cost of buying a player over several years, particularly with big signings such as Arsenal's £105 million deal for Declan Rice. However, the outstanding transfer debt is seen as inhibiting new deals, especially given the Premier League's disciplinary actions against Everton and Nottingham Forest for breaching the rules relating to financial losses.

* Read the full story

Gary Jacob, Charlotte Duncker: Fulham are trying to structure a deal to sign Armando Broja but have balked at Chelsea's £50 million valuation of the striker.

The club want to sign the forward on loan with a view to a permanent deal. This, though, would be of little benefit to Chelsea as they want to sell the 22-year-old to improve their position with Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR) and use the money to buy a top striker. As a home-grown product who has progressed through the club's academy, he would count as pure profit if sold.

Marco Silva, the Fulham head coach, signed a new contract in October until 2025 with the expectation that he would be able to strengthen the squad. However, the club do not have significant funds and face a battle to sign a player who has scored two goals in 19 appearances this season since returning from a knee injury.

* Read the full story here

Hello and welcome to The Times' live coverage of transfer deadline day. It's been a relatively quiet one this season -- there have only been 17 signings made by English top-flight clubs this month so far -- probably in no small part thanks to the looming threat of punishment if clubs are found in breach of spending rules.

But there may well be a late flurry of deals, with Armando Broja, the Chelsea striker, rumoured to be on Fulham's radar. An asking price of a reported £50 million may put off Marco Silva's side, however.

The truth is there were always going to be strict limits on how much the government could unilaterally offer the Democratic Unionist Party beyond what was agreed with the European Union in last year's Windsor framework.

2024-02-01,The mysterious word-of-mouth comedy hit you need to see,"Julia Masli's ha ha ha ha ha ha ha at the Soho Theatre is something transcendent

The best way to describe Julia Masli: ha ha ha ha ha ha ha is like being inside a dream. The room fills with ambient sounds, echoes and fragments of speech. The stage glows with hazy pinks and purples. A distorted chair is suspended from the ceiling. If you stop and scrutinise proceedings for too long, nothing makes sense. Why is that man doing carpentry? Why is that woman cutting her hair? Is that sock on fire? But give yourself over to the show's internal logic and you'll be swept along in waves of chaos and delight.

Estonian clown Masli is here to solve our problems. She stalks the theatre, dressed in a Victorian-esque blue dress and sculptural hat, eyes wide with wonder, asking a simple question: ""Problem?"" A golden mannequin leg serves as an extended microphone to help her pick up our issues. Whatever the problem, Masli - with the help of the audience - will try to solve it.

The show was a word-of-mouth hit at last year's Edinburgh Festival Fringe. What started as a work-in-progress in a low-ceilinged basement was extended again and again by popular demand. In Scotland, its location, the midnight start time, and the accumulating whispers about why you shouldn't miss it, imbued the show with a sense of mystery that coalesced into something transcendent in the room.

In a more traditional theatre setup, a little of that DIY magic is lost, it's a little less immersive. But the show has adapted - Masli now has a light to pick out distant audience members; the set contains hidden tricks. The influence of co-director Kim Noble is felt in new staging elements and the sound design of Alessio Festuccia is still a crucial component.

With so much hanging on audience input, the show is a daring mix of improvisation and set pieces. It still feels like almost anything could happen. While it thrives on the energy in the room, the more tightly rehearsed segments are lovely gems - Masli's ASMR-infused introduction, an existential guided meditation, all that business with the chair.

The most powerful moments in Edinburgh were when someone revealed something real and raw - a story of street harassment, details of a difficult marriage - and Masli frequently created a space where people felt compelled to do so. Tonight, our first problem is loneliness, and a tender moment emerges.

By the end of the show, the stage is a rich montage of the night's problems and attempted solutions. It takes a lot of skill to control so many elements, to coax the right responses from people, and that's Masli's real talent here. She retains her otherworldly wonder, while keeping everyone in line, building multiple personal narratives - and all within an hour.

Masli's constant refrain, ""I really like you"", encapsulates the energy of the show. When it all goes to plan, it's about positivity and community. The finale - a tension-filled physical act that requires crowd cooperation - brings that point home. When strangers work together, conducted by an ethereal clown, we can make a little magic.","Julia Masli's show is a daring mix of improvisation and set pieces.

2024-02-01,How to win a Test series in India - by the last captain to do it,"Now Cook, working as an analyst for TNT Sports during the second Test, speaks to about England's chances of repeating that feat over the coming weeks following their astonishing victory in Hyderabad.

After going 1-0 up, can this England team emulate your class of 2012?

I said before the series it would be very interesting to see how India cope with England's willingness to attack spin. We knew it was going to happen and it is confrontational as a captain because there's not much you can do.

Halfway through day three in Hyderabad they weren't sure where to turn or what to do. I think it shook them. So tactically, it's going to be intriguing to see what India do.

If you go back to last summer's Ashes, Australia had a massive gameplan to stop England scoring boundaries. Actually, I thought it was wrong. But that was their way of trying to stop this attacking batting line-up.

So it will be intriguing to see whether England have forced India's hand and they become more defensive in their field placings, and therefore the traditional way of getting out to the spin - caught bat-pad, caught silly point, playing defensively - England might have taken that away because they might have less men around the bat.

Has the balance power in this series now shifted?

It will give England a lot of confidence. When you play on the sub-continent it can be very overpowering. If you get behind, the momentum seems to be very hard to stop. It's very hard to change it. I think this will just see those England players looking at each other saying, ""Actually we can compete against these"".

England could still find themselves behind in the series at some point. How did you guys deal with that in 2012?

Well, after that first Test match in Ahmedabad, we obviously got heavily beaten, but we managed to prove we could score runs against them in that second innings [when Cook scored 176]. And then ultimately we had some really good spinners. It'd be a very different win now, a different way of approaching the series.

Monty Panesar and Graeme Swann were outstanding that series, they out-bowled the Indian spinners by quite a long way. It was quite easy to captain. Stokesy's thinking differently. No matter how well Tom Hartley bowled, they're still not experienced spinners like those two. So I was lucky.

If England lose a game, say they lost the next game, there'll still be times in this series where they will put India under a huge amount of pressure. If you go back to the first innings, what was missing was that hundred from an England player. Most of them got starts but no-one turned a 70 into a 160, which in sub-continent conditions, those big, big hundreds change games.

I'd always say, the first 30 balls you're looking to survive, get the pace of the wicket. It's different now. They're looking to score 30 or 40 runs in their first 30 balls! But the fundamentals are the same. Starting is hard in India against a turning ball and big runs are key because once you get the pace of the wicket, you get the spin, it's a lovely, lovely place to bat.

Were you impressed with how Stokes stuck with Hartley after his first-innings nightmare?

I don't know who else would have kept him on. What we do know is Hartley's got something about him as well to be able to then bowl in the fourth innings under pressure. And I don't think that's just down to Stokesy's captaincy and keeping him on in that first innings. I think that's down to Hartley's mental stamina or stomach for the fight as well.

In 2012, it felt like India got themselves in a muddle preparing spinning pitches. They may do so again. Does that create opportunities for the visiting team?

I would say they wanted to hammer us 4-0. That was their big thing. We'd beaten them 4-0 just before in 2011 and they wanted revenge. Pretty much in the first session, [Virender] Sehwag got hold of us and it was looking like we wouldn't be able to do much else, but we managed to fight back and in one sense it did play into our favour that they desperately wanted to hammer us.

Mumbai [before the second Test], we had a net session and it was turning square, then when we lost the toss, we thought 'geez, we're right up against it.' We're 1-0 down and they get the best use of the wicket but luckily we managed to play alright.

You know how hard it is to captain, how impressed are you with the job Stokes has done?

What has impressed me is his ability to be able to manage the players and get everyone buying into his method - that is leadership. Stokesy's done an outstanding job and it's been great to see the excitement he's brought back into English Test cricket. I think we've all been slightly surprised not how well he's done but the emotional intelligence he's had. The feel for the game and his ability to unite the side as well as he has.

2024-02-01,Bank of England holds interest rates at 5.25% again - what it means for you,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted by a majority of 6-3 to keep rates unchanged, it announced at noon, as many economists had predicted. Two members voted to increase the rate again to 5.5 per cent and another member voted to cut the rate to 5 per cent.

It raised the base rate 14 times between 2021 and last summer, in an attempt to get inflation down to its two per cent target, but has held it steady in recent times as inflation has fallen.

The vote to hold rates was widely expected, with a majority of forecasters expecting the first cut to occur in May or June this year.

It also follows the Federal Reserve choosing to leave interest rates at a 12 year high yesterday.

One reason for the Bank of England's hold is due to inflation unexpectedly rising to 4 per cent in December, up from 3.9 per cent the month prior, despite forecasts suggesting it would fall further.

Most economists expect it to fall later this year, which is when they then expect interest rates to drop. The Bank tends to cut interest rates when inflation gets lower, as higher rates cut demand for goods by making borrowing costs higher.

""We still think that inflation will be below the two per cent target by April,"" said Capital Economics earlier this month.

It does not expect the MPC to start cutting interest rates until June, although it has said this could happen before.

Economists are divided on exactly how many cuts they expect this year.

Oxford Economics said its ""central forecast"" is cuts to take the rate to 4.25 per cent by the end of 2024, while Deutsche Bank Research expects the year to end with the rate at 4.5 per cent.

Exactly what happens to the rate depends on the future path of inflation. If global events, such as the ongoing crisis in the Red Sea, push inflation upwards, then there could be fewer cuts, or even a chance of an increase in the base rate.

What will this mean for mortgage holders and renters?

Some 81 per cent of people are on fixed-rate mortgages, where the interest rate is locked for a set period of time so if you're on this type of loan, your repayments will not change based on Thursday's interest rate announcement.

These rates have come down in recent months, since a peak in the summer, but, depending on when you locked into a fix rate, you could be paying a higher interest rate.

Since the start of August 2023, the average two-year fixed rate has fallen from 6.85 per cent to 5.56 per cent and the average five-year fixed rate has fallen from 6.37 per cent to 5.18 per cent.

Those with high equity or high deposits could even find themselves a deal below 4 per cent.

Others may adopt a wait-and-see approach, possibly by taking out a tracker rate with no exit fees, while hoping that rates come down further, and they can move on to a cheaper deal in the future.

For people on trackers - which follow exactly the path of the base rate - or standard variable rates their payments should stay the same.

Renters are indirectly affected as landlords' mortgage costs, on the whole, aren't going to decrease. Plenty of landlords will still be remortgaging this year and next, seeing steep increases that they may pass on.

What does it mean for savers?

One of the most positive outcomes from higher interest rates is higher savings rates. Best deals include Coventry Building Society's easy-access account offering 5.15 per cent, and 5.16 per cent for a one-year fix with SmartSave.

While easy access rates are remaining fairly high, fixed account rates have fallen since last year.

And rates could hit a peak soon, experts warn, which mean it may be worth locking your money away now, if you want to get the highest level of interest possible.

Rachel Springall, Finance Expert at Moneyfactscompare.co.uk, said: ""Those who need quick access to their cash will be pleased to see returns on easy access accounts are thriving. Despite significant drops on fixed rate accounts, variable rates have been relatively stable or indeed risen over the past six months.

""As we have seen in the past, any cuts to base rate, or indeed expectations for interest rates to drop, can have a notable impact on variable savings rates, so it will be interesting to see how resilient the market will be in the months to come.""","Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted by a majority of 6-3 to keep rates unchanged.

2024-02-01,Luke Littler is bored of kebabs,"A month after rocketing to stardom at the World Darts Championship, the teenage sensation has taken on a more weathered demeanour

CARDIFF -- It's less than a month since his World Championship final defeat, but this feels like a different Luke Littler. Sharper haircut, new sponsors, more weathered demeanour. He already seems too old for this shit, and it's only just begun.

Littler is about to embark on his maiden Premier League Darts campaign, an invitation-only tournament across 17 nights, contested by eight of the world's best players. Since his first match at Alexandra Palace, he has already beaten five of the world's top eight players, including three en route to becoming the youngest person to win a senior PDC title at the Bahrain Masters. He hit the second nine-darter in World Series history in his quarter-final win over Nathan Aspinall, in just his tenth leg as a full-time pro.

Littler has lost just one of his eight games since the World Championship - a Dutch Masters final defeat to Michael van Gerwen, who he beat in Manama. Even then, he averaged 106.71, the highest losing average in a television final since 2017.

And now he's at Cardiff's Principality Stadium, the main event in town just three days before Wales' Six Nations opener here. The assembled media are told there are to be no questions about kebabs. He's moving away from kebabs.

He said recently he didn't have one for two weeks after his first one at the World Championship. When he first espoused his affinity for doner meat, he perhaps didn't realise quite how intricately it would become interlinked with brand Littler. There's more to him than just kebabs.

One of the first things you notice is a change of sponsors on his garish purple top. Rochdale's Prestige Building Supplies are relegated to the sleeve, Boohoo Man, part of billion-dollar fast-fashion brand Boohoo, are freshly front and centre.

Skoda Warrington are still there, but you get the sense that may not be for long when he's asked whether he's sampled their wares since turning 17: ""I think I will buy my own car. No offence to Skoda.""

His shoes and upper back are still available for sponsorship, if you're interested. Even at 17, he's still too young to advertise Premier League sponsors BetMGM, who let him choose a sponsor of his own.

He selected the Motor Neurone Disease (MND) association, explaining: ""It's for Rob Burrow, the former Leeds rugby league player. I haven't met him but I know what he's going through for the past many years. I am from [rugby league town] Warrington.

""I know what he's been through. I have seen clips of how good he was. It was my choice of charity.""

Littler claims his biggest purchase with his £200,000 World Championship purse was in-game points for EAFC, the Fifa successor, with his best ""pack"" Thierry Henry. There's an unmissably shiny gold watch on his wrist which suggests he may not be telling the whole truth.

But you can tell the sheer weight of it all is affecting Littler. His highlight of the past month? ""Chilling. When I do get a day off, I just use it. That is what I want to do. Sleep, a lot.""

He claims he doesn't practice in between tournaments, just using the two World Series events as warm-up for the Premier League.

And that's no surprise. Littler has been pulled from pillar to post and back again, a content-creating leviathan wanted by everyone. There are now Luke Littler Valentine's Day cards and a signature ""Luke Wrap"" at his local kebab house. His personalised darts sold out in under 20 minutes and he signed 1,050 EAFC posters with his face on at the Dutch Masters.

Manchester United have toured Littler round the players and had him at games, where he was pictured with Sir Alex Ferguson in a knitted sweater and chinos some way from his familiar Under Armour tracksuits. He even played darts against Harry Maguire and Christian Eriksen, hitting 180 to beat both three darts into a nine-dart challenge.

But you also see what United are getting out of this - the Instagram post of him and Sir Alex got 763,000 likes. Littler himself has 1.1m followers, more than twice the second-highest dartist in Van Gerwen. Like any 16-year-old, he loved providing updates on his following throughout the World Championship, but he's already falling victim to it. Everyone from Warrington Wolves to YouTuber boxing have already had the same idea.

And ask not just what darts has done for Littler, but what Littler has done for darts. Since the World Championship, the sport's popularity has continued to soar. Darts clubs are rammed, as are their academies.

Viagogo have said they've had a 204 per cent increase in ticket sales for the Premier League compared to last year. Nearly five million people watched the final at Ally Pally.

The players feel it too. Michael Smith thanked Littler for boosting the sport's revenue on his kids' behalf. Peter Wright said Littler has inspired him to get rid of his old darts and trophies, to start with a fresh passion for the game. Van Gerwen, in his inimitably ungrateful manner, said: ""Welcome to the big boys.""

Littler's reply? ""Surely, I am one of them now! I have joined them in the big boys league.""

His accession to the Premier League is one of a thousand changes in Littler's life, but he remains adamant he is still the same person: ""This is what I am, I am just myself. This is how I have been for many years.

""I will continue being myself. I don't need to get anything big about myself. I will just stay level-headed.""

But that isn't true, and it can't be true. He wouldn't be human if it were. He now signs his name ""the Nuke"", a sign his darting persona is already starting to infringe on his own.

After returning home after the World Championship, his family were so hounded by the press that they escaped for a week's holiday in a house on a hill in the Welsh countryside. His heroes at United and Warrington now want photos with him. He recently celebrated only being spotted by three people when out for a Chinese in St Helens for his 17th birthday.

His relationship with 21-year-old Eloise Milburn has been heavily scrutinised too, with Littler having to defend it shortly after the Worlds after six weeks of dating, at 16 years old. More than 3,000 people watched the two play EAFC together on TikTok earlier this week. Everything she now posts on social media becomes a tabloid article.

World champion Luke Humphries has said the senior pros should all put an arm around Littler, protect him from the big bad world.

But Wright and Van Gerwen disagreed, as did the man himself: ""I don't really want any advice off any of these players, I know they have been there and done it.

""But for some reason, if I do start struggling then I will speak to my mum and dad, see who they can speak to - maybe a sports psychology guy.

""I just keep myself to myself, do my practice routines and if it doesn't start working out, then something will have to change.""

Littler's first match in Cardiff is against Humphries, who he beat in the Netherlands last week, recovering from a 4-2 leg deficit to win 6-5. A potential semi-final could bring his third match against Van Gerwen in as many weeks.

Premature entry into the Premier League has broken players before, but there is currently nothing to suggest Littler will be next. At this rate, everything away from the oche is much more of a worry.","Luke Littler is about to embark on his maiden Premier League Darts campaign.

2024-02-01,What to do in an acid attack and how to help a victim,"999 should be called as soon as possible, while witnesses can help by stripping contaminated clothing and thoroughly rinsing affected areas

Acid attacks, in which corrosive chemical substances such as nitric, hydrochloric or sulphuric acid are thrown, sprayed onto or otherwise used to attack victims, have spiked several times across the UK in recent years.

Police force data in England and Wales showed a 69 per cent increase in acid attacks in 2022 compared to 2021, jumping from 421 to 710, according to Acid Survivors Trust International (ASTI).

The real figure could be higher still, ASTI warned, given several forces including Police Scotland did not respond to the charity's Freedom of Information (FOI) requests. There was a peak of 941 recorded cases in 2017, numbers which had been on the decline until 2022.

In the event of an acid attack, which can cause immediate pain and life-changing injuries and disabilities, prompt action by witnesses could play a crucial role in helping reduce pain and long-term damage suffered by the victim while medical services are on their way.

Witnesses should try to stay on the phone and follow any advice given by the 999 call handler until an ambulance arrives, but you can also try to help prevent severe injuries by aiming to carefully remove the chemical and any contaminated clothing from the victim and rinsing the affected area with plenty of clean water.

How can you help a victim?

NHS advice for dealing with acid and chemical burns states that after calling 999 and asking for urgent help, immediate assistance could include trying to remove the chemical and any contaminated clothing from contact with a victim's skin or eyes.

Gloves or other protective materials should be used to cover your hands when doing so, and clothing should be cut away with scissors if possible to avoid further spreading the chemical used.

Any dry chemical used should be brushed, not rubbed or wiped, off the skin before rinsing with water.

The affected area should then be rinsed continuously with as much clean water as possible, as soon as possible, while ensuring that water can run off without pooling on the victim's skin.

This should ideally be done for at least 20 minutes.

Water should be used rather than trying to rub or wipe the area as doing the latter risks spreading the chemical substance further.

Once in hospital, immediate treatment would typically include pain relief and further washing off of the corrosive material with water before burns can be cleaned and covered with regularly-changed dressing.

Depending on the severity of their burns suffered in the attack and how quickly they are treated, victims could recover with minimal scarring or require surgery and skin grafts and be left with significant scarring as well as injuries that take months or even years to heal.

The location of burns could also lead to long-term problems such as sight loss or restricted limb or muscle use.

There are various support groups for acid attack victims and their families, as well as a number of national organisations that can provide situation-specific help, advice and support, including Changing Faces, Victim Support and the Katie Piper Foundation.",Acid attacks have spiked several times across the UK in recent years.

2024-02-01,Donald Trump's High Court claim over 'sex party' allegations dismissed by judge,"Allegations the former US president took part in 'perverted' sex acts and gave bribes to Russian officials have been dismissed by his legal team as 'egregiously inaccurate'

Donald Trump's data protection claim over allegations he participated in ""perverted"" sex acts and gave bribes to Russian officials has been dismissed by a High Court judge.

The former US president, 77, brought legal action against Orbis Business Intelligence, a consultancy founded by former MI6 officer Christopher Steele, and sought compensation for distress.

Mr Steele, who previously ran the Secret Intelligence Service's Russia desk, was the author of the so-called Steele dossier which included denied allegations Mr Trump had been ""compromised"" by the Russian security service, the FSB.

At a hearing in London last year, the court was told Mr Trump was bringing his case over two memos in the dossier which claimed he had taken part in ""sex parties"" while in St Petersburg and allegedly engaged in ""golden showers"" with prostitutes in Moscow.

Mr Trump's legal team claimed the document breached UK data protection laws.

Lawyers for Orbis asked for Mr Trump's claim to be thrown out, telling the court it was ""brought for the purpose of harassing Orbis and Mr Steele and pursuing longstanding grievances"".

In a judgment on Thursday, Mrs Justice Steyn said: ""In my view, there are no compelling reasons to allow the claim to proceed to trial in circumstances where, whatever the merits of the allegation that the personal data are inaccurate may be, the claim for compensation and/or damages... is bound to fail.""

She added: ""In reality, the claimant is seeking court findings to vindicate his reputation in circumstances where has not been able to formulate any viable remedy which he would have a real prospect of obtaining, or which would itself be of any utility; and having chosen to allow many years to elapse - without any attempt to vindicate his reputation in this jurisdiction - since he was first made aware of the dossier, including the memoranda, on 6 January 2017.""

Hugh Tomlinson KC, for Mr Trump, described the allegations in the memos - which also included a claim the 2024 Republican presidential nominee frontrunner ""defiled"" a bed previously used by former president Barack Obama and his wife - as ""egregiously inaccurate"".

Orbis has maintained it did not make the dossier public and Mrs Justice Steyn said that its mere possession of the memos could not cause Mr Trump distress.

""Mere storage of the memoranda by the defendant cannot sensibly be said to have had any impact on the claimant - if he was even aware of it - not least in circumstances where the memoranda are on the internet,"" the judge said.

The Steele dossier, which comprised of more than a dozen memos, was produced by Orbis in 2016 ahead of the US presidential election that Mr Trump won. It was leaked to and published by BuzzFeed in 2017.

During Thursday's hearing, Antony White KC, for the consultancy, said the case had been brought to pursue a ""vendetta"" against Orbis and Mr Steele.

He said: ""The claimant has a deep and intense animus against Mr Steele and Orbis, which is reflected in numerous vituperative public statements which he has made since the dossier was made public by BuzzFeed in 2017.""

Mr White added that Mr Trump ""has a long history of repeatedly bringing frivolous, meritless and vexatious claims for the purpose of vexing and harassing perceived enemies and others against whom he bears a grudge"".","Donald Trump brought legal action against Orbis Business Intelligence, a consultancy founded by former MI6 officer Christopher Steele.

2024-02-01,Michael Cunningham's Day is a disappointing return after a 10-year hiatus,"The Pulitzer-winner abandoned a planned family saga when the pandemic hit. But it is hard to care about what he wrote instead

Day wasn't the novel Michael Cunningham expected to publish after a 10-year hiatus. The acclaimed American author had been writing a contemporary multigenerational family saga. But then the pandemic hit and Cunningham, who is best known for his 1998 Pulitzer prize-winning The Hours, felt compelled to start again. The upshot is another contribution to the swelling wave of Covid literature (see Sigrid Nunez's recent The Vulnerables and Elizabeth Strout's Lucy by the Sea), even if Cunningham never mentions the C-word.

The virus provides the narrative thrust for a book that is set on a single day over a three year-span. The story gets going on the morning of 5 April, 2019, continues on the afternoon of 5 April, 2020, and concludes during the evening of 5 April, 2021. It's a neat structure that owes much to Cunningham's literary heroine, Virginia Woolf, although Mrs Dalloway, which inspired The Hours, sticks to a single 24-hour period.

Day starts before dawn, with Isabel, ""for whom sleep is rarely more than a skittish, dream-flecked attempt at sleep"", staring out of a Brooklyn brownstone window. Dan, the husband whom she no longer loves, is deeply asleep, as are their children, Nathan, 10, and five-year-old Violet. Her brother Robbie, a schoolteacher, rents their attic apartment, but will soon be ejected. ""You're lucky until your luck expires. You're lucky until your sister wants the apartment back,"" writes Cunningham. Dan and Isabel both worship Robbie but need the space for Nathan: they only own the brownstone's top half.

Because this is a Cunningham novel, all the adults are beset by middle-aged anguish and ennui. Dan, a former rock'n'roller-turned-househusband, is struggling to reignite his singing career but fears he is destined for the odd gig at a Mexican restaurant. Isabel is feeling claustrophobic and disappointed by her lot in life, despite having the marriage and the job, as a magazine editor, she wanted. Her condition is ""unprofound. It's white lady problems"", she knows.

And Robbie? Unlucky-in-love Robbie? He is living vicariously via his invented Instagram avatar, Wolfe (#wolfe_man), a sable-stubbled paediatrician whose 3,407 followers ""like his chronicle of his own dailiness"" and may be in love with him. Then there is Garth, Dan's wayward artist brother and sperm donor to Chess, a college professor.

Even the children, who are the most interesting characters here, are suffering. Nathan's two friends don't need him the way he needs them, while Violet finds it tough battling ""the need to be right with her need to have the mysteries explained"". And that's all before the pandemic hits and boredom becomes a global phenomenon.

When we rejoin the household in April 2020, Robbie has moved out, quit his teaching job and is stuck in Iceland, where a six-week trip has become a four-month stay. In Brooklyn, Isabel and Dan are drifting further apart despite being locked down closer together, but even this only happens in a languid, Cunningham sort of a way. ""Is there (she suspects there must be) an interlude during which you're so bored or disappointed or ambushed by regret that it is, truly, too late?"" Isabel muses.

As with his other books including The Hours and By Nightfall, Cunningham deploys an omniscient narrator fond of the sort of languorous prose tempting to anyone struggling to hit a word count. (""Dan is taken by a tremor of scorn twisted up with painful affection, as if they were two names for the same emotion."") This detached style of narration backfires because by the denouement, in the supposedly tragic third section, I am struggling to care about any of the characters.

When college professor Chess tells her students on 5 April, 2019, ""We are, however, stuck this week, with a novel about white people"", she inadvertently nailed my feelings about what Isabel and co get up to during the pandemic. Cunningham has written the sort of book that would have filled a day or two during lockdown, but I can't help wishing he'd stuck with his initial literary endeavour.",Michael Cunningham abandoned a planned family saga when the pandemic hit.

2024-02-01,Under the Hornbeams really is the loveliest of books,"The anthropologist spent a year chatting to two men living on the streets for this abundantly warm book

One of the more interesting aspects of having to live through a pandemic was the opportunity it gave us to slow down and peer at the world around us more closely. Emma Tarlo, a university professor and anthropologist, began spending her allotted hour of daily outdoor exercise by walking in London's Regent's Park, where, a friend had told her, two intriguing characters camped out in the open, and were always happy to talk.

An anthropologist, Tarlo relays, ""takes an interest in people and their lives"", which is what she does here, with Nick and Pascal. The two men have lived alongside one another on the streets for 16 years, the last half-dozen spent kipping down in this particular park, under the canopy of its trees. Nick is 64, well-read and well-travelled, and loves to converse; Pascal is younger, of French/Algerian extraction, and prefers to keep his own counsel. The year Tarlo spends in their (almost daily) company is documented in Under the Hornbeams, and has been written with the blessings of both men.

""The more oppressive and constricting all this feels,"" she writes of the lockdown, ""the more visiting them feels like an escape. I can't help recognising a certain freedom in their way of life, in spite of the inevitable hardship it entails.""

The men only reveal to her their complicated backstories sparingly, and selectively. Both men like sleeping outdoors, and have no desire for proper shelter. Nick refers to himself as a ""hobo"", and if this can get difficult in the grip of a freezing winter, then needs must.

But the portrait she paints is at times so charming and romantic that you do wonder whether Tarlo herself - who arrives into the park for lunch dates on a bright orange bicycle, bringing soup and assorted savouries in cute little tiffin boxes - hasn't been dreamt up by Richard Curtis.

It is testament to Tarlo's gifts as a storyteller that her book is neither twee nor pious. Yes, this good Samaritan who lives in one of London's more enviable postcodes might offer food, books and supplies, but the men respond in kind with conversation and friendship. Together, they spend hours - sitting on the grass when it's dry, under umbrellas when wet - discussing philosophy, films, the food they liked as children. Nick and Pascal may have opted out of a notionally more ordinary life, but they remain alert and engaged; their days have structure. There are no drugs, and they are not drunks, but rather chat soberly about Radio 4, and reference George Orwell's Down and Out in London and Paris, a book that also endeavoured to show just how much all of us ultimately have in common, irrespective of privilege, circumstance and luck.

Over the changing seasons - and several new sleeping bags - trust is developed, and intimacies exchanged. The men wonder whether it might be time to move on, while Tarlo, who is in her mid-50s, is herself considering calling time on her university job for something new. Life changes, even when it essentially stays the same.

If, at 362 pages, Under the Hornbeams can at times feel a little long, then you nevertheless finish it pining immediately to return to its gentle ebb and flow, its abundant warmth.

2024-02-01,I'm a man and I earn less than my partner - it feels pretty good,"The quality of my relationships isn't tied to how much I earn - it's likely I earned more than my past girlfriends because of my own undeserved advantages

I needed to quit the job. As a magazine editor, I was getting pretty unhappy and demotivated by the work I was being told to produce. While it wasn't the only source of my dip in mood, it was a source that I had to confront for eight hours a day, five days a week. You could say I have a low tolerance for doing things I don't want to do.

But whatever the case, life is short, and after a few months of dragging myself into work, flogging the dead horse that was my soul, I decided to shake things up and leave. The idea was that I could freelance again and only do the sort of work I would like to do - follow my ambitions, not just coast.

I'd spoken to my partner about it, and they supported my decision. Quitting made me feel better on the whole, so I'd recommend it. But there was something I hadn't given a whole lot of thought to: money.

I don't mean that, in a cost of living crisis fuelled by a dozen years of austerity and short-sighted, egotistical Tory rule (in my opinion), money is so small a problem that I can swan about jobless and simply not think about my bank balance. Far from it: money is the bane of my existence, it is on my mind always. The wealth of thought I have about my finances is at direct odds with the inactivity in my savings pot. But I hadn't thought about how it might affect my relationship.

See, I can generally do without. I have spent many days in London walking instead of catching the Tube (probably enough to wear down a pair of shoes or two more than the average person, and shoes aren't cheap - so maybe I've lost money doing that in the long term) and eating dinners of bulk-bought rice, tinned beans, and frozen vegetables. I know how to keep my costs low. I actually don't mind living like that one bit: beans cooked well and seasoned are one of my favourite foods, frozen vegetables done in the microwave are nutritious and also delicious. But I realised - when telling myself I'd be going back to this way of living for a bit - it doesn't really make for a fun and glamorous relationship.

I have always earned more than my exes. I have probably in part stayed in jobs and overworked myself in previous relationships to ensure I was ahead financially. Perhaps I even worked so much that it made my relationships worse, not better.

This time, I've prioritised my happiness. I know that in the past, my ideas about what it means to be a man in a relationship would have stopped me from taking such a bold step. The reason I felt it was fine to put myself first this time is that my partner and I make a point of protecting our autonomy.

We don't want to live together, we don't want children and our finances will never seriously intertwine. But I was still worried that this change to my lifestyle would have side effects. Would they get bored of me if I kept saying I can't go and do anything other than watch telly? If I once again made rice and peas when they stayed over? There is plenty to do in London for free, but not in the evenings, and not in the arse end of winter, except maybe a romantic one-degree walk over black ice. I don't think so.

We soon exhausted the handful of cheap eats still available nearby. I wondered if they thought I might expect them to subsidise me somehow, which wouldn't feel fair or right to me, given that we've always split things. I also don't want the complication of owing them money.

As anyone in a good and healthy relationship should do when worried about something, I confided in my partner. More than anything I worried that because I no longer had the funds to go out for a meal, or take a trip to a gallery or the cinema each weekend, we would find we got bored, or that the relationship was boring, and then it would end because I was no longer able to sustain the relationship and our lifestyle as a couple.

Immediately after we had this conversation around a month ago, I realised and was reassured that this was a ""me"" problem, and that there was in fact nothing to worry about. My partner is very understanding, too understanding in fact - and would start stockpiling tinned soup for us to eat when I visited them just so I'd feel better.

We can and do make our own fun. I've started watching more TV and I'm quite enjoying it. But when we're together, we also just chat and put the world to rights, share book recommendations, go for strolls and get a small bite to eat at the weekend. Once a month, we still might have a nice meal out.

We didn't fall in love by spending money together - we didn't even go on dates. We met at work - the job I left. We were spending time together before we had even reserved a table for two.

In the end, it's not about money. It's about how you choose to face the world despite the things you could allow to hold you back.

I'm still not used to being the person earning less. At times it makes me feel emasculated. That's nothing to do with my partner really. It's more that if we wanted to be equals, sometimes I feel like I'm coming up short.

But these feelings come up less than you might assume. Ultimately, I'm at peace with life's inevitable ups and downs, how some of us get head starts and some of us must spend life catching up. That's just the way things are. Besides, it's highly likely that I have earned more than my exes (all women) because of my own undeserved advantages, the white bonus ball(s) handed to me in the genetic lottery.

For now, I'm okay with things, and have learned some valuable lessons that I'll take with me going forward, even if I go back to earning more. I now realise I must pay attention to how my workload is affecting my personal life; whether I have too much or too little going on. And that the quality of my relationships isn't tied to how much I earn.","'I have always earned more than my exes,' says magazine editor.

2024-02-01,Who is James Baldwin? Why a Google Doodle is honouring American writer today,"In 1998, a collection of some of his works titled James Baldwin: Collected Essays was published posthumously.

James Baldwin was an American writer and civil rights activist most acclaimed for his various works exploring key social issues of race, class and sexuality in the midst of the civil rights and gay liberation movements of mid-20th century America.

Born in 1924 in Harlem, New York, to a single mother, Baldwin's first novel - titled Go Tell It on the Mountain - was published in 1953 after he had relocated to Paris on a fellowship.

After facing frequent racial discrimination growing up in New York and struggling to find work to help support his family, which included eight younger children from his mother's later marriage to his stepfather, David Baldwin, Baldwin moved to the city's artistic hub of Greenwich Village and began to publish essays and short stories while working on his debut novel.

Earning a first fellowship to cover his expenses in 1945, Baldwin relocated to Paris on a second of many fellowships, later saying he felt more freedom in the French capital to write about his personal background and the prominent themes of race and sexuality which would run through his many works.

Becoming a well-known figure and leading voice in the American civil rights movement, Baldwin's various career accolades included The Commandeur de la Légion d'honneur (National Order of the Legion of Honour), the highest French order of merit, for literary excellence.

He died in the French town of Saint-Paul-de-Vence in December 1987, aged 63.

His semi-autobiographical debut novel, Go Tell It on the Mountain, took the writer 12 years to complete but would go on to be recognised by Time magazine as one of the 100 best English-language novels between 1923 and 2005.

Notes of a Native Son, Baldwin's first essay collection, was released in 1955, with Giovanni's Room, his second novel and one notable for its portrayal of homosexuality, of published the following year - years prior to the height of the gay liberation movement of the late 1960s-1980s.

James Baldwin: Collected Essays, a comprehensive collection of his non-fiction work, was published in 1998.

Labour will freeze corporation tax for its first term in Government if it wins the general election, Rachel Reeves has announced.

The Shadow Chancellor pledged to ""bring back stability"" to the British economy as she unveiled Labour's plans to cap the tax at the current 25 per cent rate for the entirety of the next Parliament.

The party would monitor the impact of the tax rate on the UK's competitiveness and act ""if needed,"" Ms Reeves said.

In a keynote speech to 400 City leaders at Labour Party's Business Conference on Thursday, she said ""tax rates cannot shoot up and down like a yo-yo, according to each political whim"".

""After 14 years of uncertainty under this Conservative government, investment has cratered,"" she said.

""What Labour offers is a genuinely pro-business tax plan. Founded on a fair contract between a pro-business government and great British business.""

Ms Reeves claimed there have been 26 changes to corporation tax in the last Parliament alone, adding: ""We can't go on like this.""

She told business leaders the 25 per cent corporation tax bill are ""strikes the correct balance between the needs of our public finances, and the demands of a competitive global economy"".","Shadow Chancellor unveils plans to cap corporation tax at current 25 per cent rate.

2024-02-01,Lewis Hamilton tipped for shock Ferrari move in 2025,"Ferrari want seven-time champion Hamilton to partner Charles Leclerc after 13 years with Mercedes.

Hamilton signed a new deal until the end of the 2025 season with Mercedes last summer, by which time he would be 40, but it appears he can leave after one year.

An official announcement of the move could come as early as Thursday, according to the BBC.

There have long been rumours of talks between Hamilton and Ferrari, with the constructor admitting they held talks with him in 2019.

But following reports this week in the Italian and Spanish media of a potential move, it has now been confirmed as a genuine possibility in the coming days and weeks.

Hamilton won his most recent world title in 2020, but Mercedes have since struggled to keep pace with Max Verstappen and Red Bull.

Verstappen has won the last three F1 championships, including his highly controversial 2021 win over Hamilton in Abu Dhabi.

2024-02-01,Three dead and five critical after Idaho airport hangar collapse,"'It's shocking to see a building falling in on itself,' witness Cody McGowan said

Three people have died and nine were injured after an under-construction hangar collapsed at Boise Airport, Idaho, the city's fire department.

Five of the injured were in critical condition, the fire department said.

Authorities responded at about 5pm Wednesday local time (12am GMT) to the privately owned steel-framed hangar, which suffered a ""catastrophic"" collapse, Boise Fire Department operations chief Aaron Hummel said.

Everyone who had been at the site had been accounted for as of Wednesday evening, he said.

""It was a very chaotic scene,"" Mr Hummel said, describing the incident as a ""large-scale collapse"" of the framework of the building.

""I don't know what caused it, but I can tell you it was a pretty global collapse,"" he said.

Terra Furman was driving on Interstate 84 at about 5.30pm when she spotted at least 20 police cars, ambulances and firetrucks about a quarter of a mile (400 metres) from the entry to the airport. They were surrounding what she described as a crane folded in half and a building collapsed into the shape of an ""M"".

""The walls were still up at a point and the middle collapsed in on either side,"" she said.

Mr Hummel said some of the victims were on a hoist or other elevated platform at the time the structure fell, and that required some specialised rescue efforts.

He confirmed that a crane also collapsed in the incident.

Leticia Ramirez, a spokesperson for Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center in Boise, said emergency and trauma teams were working with first responders to treat patients who arrived from the scene.

Authorities are investigating what caused the collapse. It happened next to Jackson Jet Center, which offers private airplane charters and maintenance.

Boise city records show the contractor Big D Builders had obtained permits to build a 39,000-square-foot (3,623-square-metre) jet hangar for Jackson Jet Center.

The £4.9m project was to include the construction of a concrete foundation and a metal building.

Messages left by phone and email seeking comment from Big D Builders were not immediately returned.

Jessica Flynn, CEO of Jackson Jet Center, said the firm's ""hearts go out to everyone affected by this horrific event"".

Ms Flynn said the collapse happened just west of the existing Jackson Jet Center at a site where the company's new hangar was under construction. She said dozens of people were working on the site.

""We do not know exactly what caused the hangar collapse,"" Ms Flynn said. ""Our focus now is on supporting our team and partners during this difficult time.""

James Quintana was driving to the airport when he saw emergency vehicles rushing past him. He said he immediately thought it was a plane crash. He then saw the collapsed hangar and paramedics tending to victims.

""I'm retired law enforcement and when there is that much commotion, that many emergency personnel and vehicles, there is something huge that has taken place,"" he said. ""It was a scary sight.""

Cody McGowan was working less than 100 metres from the building when he said he heard something that sounded like a loud dog whine.

When he looked up, he saw a hangar as tall as three and a half to four stories tall collapsing in on itself and part of the crane on top.

""When I walked up there, you're just kind of like, 'Wow',"" he said. ""It's shocking to see a building falling in on itself.""","Three people have died and nine were injured after an under-construction hangar collapsed at Boise Airport, Idaho.

2024-02-01,I am reaching pension age and I'm scared that I don't have enough money,"Joanna Stern works long hours but still fears she can't afford retirement

As Joanna Streames gets older, the prospect of retirement has been weighing heavier on her mind, as has the worry of how much she actually has saved in her pension.

The 52-year-old is one of many who is concerned she hasn't put enough aside for later life.

""No one ever told me I should put money away for retirement,"" she said, ""Now I'm worried I won't have enough.""

It wasn't until automatic enrolment rules, which means companies must enroll their employees in pension schemes, came into play in 2012 that Joanna started accruing money for retirement.

Now, the criminal solicitor has ""next to nothing"" in her pension pot, which is in the thousands.

She says her upbringing partly has an impact on her lack of financial awareness.

Joanna brought up her 14-year-old sister, Sian, when she was only 19, after their mother died suddenly. ""We didn't have family anywhere near us, so I decided I was the best suited to take care of my sister.""

The sisters found themselves counting pennies and looking for money as they struggled financially for years.

She didn't have anyone to help teach her about how much she should be putting into a pension pot. Although it was a difficult time, Joanna is still annoyed that she was not adequately educated about saving for the future.

She said: ""It wasn't until I got older that I started thinking of retirement. I am frustrated nobody ever mentioned it to me, because if I started saving earlier it would all be different now.

""Now I probably need to work far into retirement age to be able to sustain the life I want.""

It comes as a new survey shows more than 50 per cent said planning for retirement feels like navigating a complex minefield due to lack of knowledge. The research, done by Annuity Ready, also found that a third of its respondents were feeling anxious or overwhelmed about planning for retirement.

Jonna Elson, chief executive at Independent Age, a charity, said: ""Far too many older people in financial hardship face later life with little or no savings, struggling to afford even essentials. Many of the older people we speak to have worked all their lives and yet do not have enough money in retirement.""

Now, Joanna urges more people to engage with their savings. ""Make provision with insurance policies in as many areas as you can, have a safety fund, and invest whenever you can,"" she said.

""I brought my children up and built a business of my own so I could provide, not just the basics, but a great life for myself and my two daughters,"" she said.

""My next challenge is a good life in retirement but I am certain I will find a way.""",Joanna Streames is concerned she hasn't put enough aside for later life.

2024-02-01,Why councils are on brink of bankruptcy as £4bn spending gap revealed,"MPs highlighted soaring costs for social care, special educational needs and tackling homelessness as key pressure points for councils

Council services will be at risk if the Government fails to ""fix the £4bn hole"" in local authority finances, MPs have warned.

Four councils have effectively been declared bankrupt in the past year including Birmingham City and Nottingham City, with many more at risk of following suit as they make drastic spending cuts to avoid potential insolvency.

In a report published on Thursday, the Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Committee called on the Government to reform council tax and overhaul the wider funding system for local authorities.

The cross-party group of MPs also urged ministers to use the local government financial settlement to help bridge a £4bn funding gap next year or ""risk already strained council services becoming stretched to breaking point"".

Clive Betts, Labour MP and chair of the committee, said if the Government ""fails to plug this gap, well-run councils could face the very real prospect of effectively going bust"".

He highlighted three key areas of pressure that have contributed to the current crisis:

Adult and children's social care

The report said rising demand for adult social care ""driven by a changing population with increasingly complex needs"" has contributed to ""unmanageable bills"" for some local authorities.

It also said rising demand for residential care placements for children, coupled with soaring bills charged by privately run children's homes, has driven significant cost increases for councils.

Around 70p of every £1 of top-tier council spending is thought to be spent on adult and children's social care, with pressures in the sector exacerbated by long-term workforce shortages and inflation.

Last week, Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove announced a £600m support package for councils to help with the ""unprecedented challenges that they have faced"", with the majority going towards social care budgets.

But the committee said on Thursday said that while it welcomed Government's commitment to implementing fundamental reforms of the sector, a ""consistent and sustainable increase in funding is required in the long term"".

Special educational needs

The report also highlighted soaring costs of services for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), as it called for a review to ensure sustainable funding and proper access.

MPs on the committee said demands for home-to-school transport and placements in special schools located outside of families' local areas were particularly expensive.

The latest estimate of local authorities' budget deficits relating to SEND services across England is approximately £2.3bn, with the figure projected to jump to £3.6bn by 2025.

The committee warned that struggles have spiralled as the level of funding available to local authorities has not kept pace with demand.

Rising homelessness

MPs warned that increasing levels of homelessness have forced local authorities to spend cash on expensive temporary accommodation and emergency support.

The report said a key driver of increased homelessness has been the Government's decision to freeze local housing allowance rates at April 2020 levels, which has seen families evicted over the past few years.

The committee said the freeze has constrained the available supply of housing by making increasing numbers of properties unaffordable to those receiving benefits.

Ministers plan to uplift the allowance for a year from April, but MPs warned the respite will only be temporary.

They said that ""ultimately the Government needs to deliver more affordable housing to provide a sustainable alternative to local authorities' increasing need to use temporary accommodation"".","MPs highlight soaring costs for social care, special educational needs and tackling homelessness. four councils have effectively been declared bankrupt in the past year including Birmingham City and Nottingham City.

2024-02-01,Shell makes $7.3bn quarterly profit - here's why earnings are actually falling,"Oil group gives billions to shareholders sparking calls for stronger energy windfall tax

Shell has said annual profits fell last year after lower oil and gas prices hit its bottom line.

The oil group, Europe's biggest, reported earnings of $28.3bn(£22.4bn) for 2023, a 29 per cent drop from the record $39.9bn it reported last year after energy prices spiked following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The price of Brent crude oil reached nearly $128 a barrel following the invasion, but has since dropped and is currently at about $80. The price of gas also hit record highs but has since fallen back.

Shell said it prospered from ""exceptional"" trading opportunities on the global gas market and increased amounts of liquefied natural gas (LNG) available for sale to countries in Europe who have been eager for fuel supplies after Russian pipelines were shut down.

Shell's renewables division, controversially pared back by the company, reported earnings of $15m (£122m).

Despite the 30 per cent drop in profits, Shell said it would handback billions to its shareholders at the expense of its customers as it announced a further $3.5bn share buyback.

""Shell delivered another quarter of strong performance,"" said chief executive Wael Sawan. ""As we enter 2024 we are continuing to simplify our organisation with a focus on delivering more value with less emissions.""

The Shell profits, the second highest in the past decade, angered climate and poverty protesters sparking calls for a stronger windfall tax on oil and gas firms.

Imogen Dow, of Friends of the Earth, said: ""Last year was one of Shell's most profitable years ever as the oil and gas industry continues to rake in billions while billpayers face another winter of soaring energy prices. It's been more than two years since energy prices first shot up and still the UK's cold homes crisis remains unaddressed, at detriment to the millions struggling to stay warm and well this winter.

""By rolling out a street-by-street insulation programme, and rapidly expanding the UK's homegrown renewable power production, the Government can bring down bills quickly, keep millions warmer and slash carbon emissions. This can and should be funded in part through a windfall tax on the fossil fuel companies fuelling the climate crisis and driving up energy prices.""

Maja Darlington, of Greenpeace UK, said: ""Fires are raging across Colombia, Britain has been wracked by floods, 2023 smashed global temperature records, but Shell is posting yet more obscene profits from climate-wrecking fossil fuels.

""While customers struggle with the cost of living crisis, Shell shovels over $20bn to shareholders and drills for yet more oil and gas, climate disasters are multiplying and hitting hardest those who have done the least to cause the crisis. It's time to end the fossil fuel party. Our Government must make oil companies like Shell stop drilling and start using their immense wealth to pay for the damage they are causing, before all our futures go up in flames.""

Chiara Liguori, of Oxfam UK, said: ""It is nonsensical that the biggest and richest polluters like Shell are allowed to reap huge profits while the world struggles to deal with the irreversible damage they have caused - and continue to cause - to our planet.

""Earnings may have fallen from last year's record figures, but they are still in the billions. Oil companies are coining it in at the expense of people living in poverty - both at home and abroad - who are left paying the highest price for the devastating impacts of a climate crisis they did little to cause.

""The Government must hold big polluters to account by taxing them more and helping to incentivise a fair switch to clean, renewable energy as well as supporting low-income communities on the front line of the crisis. This payment is well overdue.""

Jamie Maddock, energy analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said Shell had performed better than expected. ""While earnings are lower than they were this time last year, to the tune of around 25 per cent, Shell continues to be resilient and delivered stronger results than expected. By some estimations, earnings were 20 per cent better than expectations.

""Much of the fall compared to last year was to be expected given the prices of oil and gas have plummeted following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But strong results relative to expectations have continued to be driven by the gas divisions.""

He said the war in Gaza and the Red Sea crisis meant oil and gas prices are likely to remain unpredictable. ""It is these sorts of environments that energy giants can thrive in, as we saw in 2022, so it wouldn't be a shock to see Shell continuing to deliver over the course of the year.""","Oil group gives billions to shareholders sparking calls for stronger energy windfall tax.

2024-02-01,How our healthcare system could be improved by not giving all patients drugs,"An experience with a herbal doctor led guided Professor Jeremy Howick towards the path of evidenced-based medicine - and the science of placebos.

This is i on Science, a subscriber-only newsletter from i. If you'd like to get this direct to your inbox, every single week, you can sign up here.

Jeremy Howick's interest in the power of placebos dates back 30 years to when he was a competitive rower at Dartmouth College, the Ivy League college in Hanover, New Hampshire.

""My coach used to say to me: 'Never take any medicine without checking the ingredients,' because you might get a positive drug test after a race. And you'd hear stories from guys who say they were prescribed allergy medicines and get into trouble.""

The Canadian-born academic and author developed an allergy while competing and struggled to sleep, which left him feeling stressed and unable to think properly.

""As a last attempt, I took my mother's advice and went to see a herbal doctor. I thought it wasn't going to work. I expected to walk into a white crystals on the wall kind of scenario, but it was nothing of the sort.

""We had a five-minute conversation about things ranging from my allergy to the stresses of high-level rowing. She suggested ginger tea, which I thought can't possibly work. Within three days my allergy symptoms disappeared. I wondered whether it actually was the ginger tea or was it the placebo effect? I still don't know.""

The whole experience guided Professor Howick towards the path of evidenced-based medicine, culminating in his new book - The Power of Placebos: How the Science of Placebos and Nocebos Can Improve Health Care.

Placebos are the most widely used treatments in the history of medicine, used as a ""gold standard"" in clinical trials. However, Professor Howick argues they should be avoided in trials, while also saying that there should be an ethical requirement for doctors to induce placebo effects in their patients.

Professor Howick, now Professor of Empathic Healthcare and Director of the Stoneygate Centre for Empathic Healthcare at the University of Leicester, says: ""Academics who have been researching placebos have their heads stuck in ivory towers. They carry on doing research where we already know the answer. Drug companies will carry on paying for trials using placebos purely for commercial reasons.""

He uses an example from the 90s and people with alcoholic liver disease when a company came along to test a new drug for those patients against a placebo, instead of against a known established treatment.

""It turns out that's an ethical practice. You're ethically allowed to test new treatments against placebos, even if there is an established treatment you know is better than a placebo. This is bonkers. And it's because the World Medical Association declaration in Helsinki allows this and that there are methodological reasons for this. It just doesn't make sense.

""If you want to go to Greece this summer you compare flights and times and you make a decision. It should be the same thing with medicines. People enrolled in the placebo-controlled alcoholic liver disease trial had a 20 per cent higher chance of dying compared to if the trial had been comparing the new drug against an established standard. Of course, it's much easier to prove your product is better than a placebo than compared with another treatment, when it might not be.""

Whereas in double-blind clinical trials, the patient should not know (though they often do) which drug is the real one and which is the placebo, when it comes to clinical practice, Professor Howick says doctors shy away from offering ""sugar pills"" to try and induce a placebo effect because they believe it requires deception for the placebo to work.

""That's false, because there have been more than a dozen trials using 'honest' placebos to treat patients as well as so-called 'deceptive' placebos, where the patient does not know the difference.

And they show honest placebos work: you have subconscious expectations which, by definition, are not under your conscious control.

""We know the placebo effect exists, so doctors should go and promote it to their patients and avoid nocebo effects - the negative effects of a placebo - which are even less well known.""

Professor Howick moves on to opioid crisis, citing a number of people who become dependent on the powerful drugs after taking them following surgery.

""A percentage of those, small but measurable, will die. There's a trial ongoing now where half of people following surgery will receive morphine and half will receive a placebo. The evidence suggests very strongly that the painkilling effect continues to take place, but you will become less dependent on that painkiller by the end, because you're not dependent on external opioid, you're dependent on internal ones. Why shouldn't that be standard practice? There's no ethical objection.""

You also do not need placebo pills to experience placebo effects, Professor Howick says, pointing to a 2004 trial involving 278 post-operative patients who had undergone chest surgery for different conditions. They were all told that they could receive either a painkiller or nothing, depending on their post-operative state and that they would not necessarily be told when the painkilling treatment would start.

All the patients were still in the hospital and hooked up to an intravenous device. The patients were then split into two groups: the overt group was treated by doctors who ""gave the open drug at the bedside, telling the patient that the injection was a powerful analgesic and that the pain was going to subside in a few minutes"".

One dose of painkiller was administered every 15 minutes, and the patients were asked to rate their pain: 0 signaled no pain and 10 unbearable pain. They continued receiving a dose of painkiller every 15 minutes until the patients said that their pain was reduced by 50 per cent.

Patients in the second (covert) group received the same amount of painkiller every 15 minutes and reported how much pain they experienced on the same 10-point scale. But they did not know they were receiving a painkiller, which was delivered through a preprogrammed infusion machine already attached to the patient through the IV line without any doctor or nurse in the room telling them that the powerful drugs would make their pain go away quickly.

These covertly treated patients needed 30 per cent more drugs to reduce their pain by 50 per cent. ""The study showed that positive expectations that pain will go away can reduce pain,"" Professor Howick writes.

""This is a placebo effect without a placebo. Placebos have been studied more than any other treatment in the history of medicine. Doctors need to start inducing placebo effects without placebos. They have to do it and realise the extent of the science behind it. And, as I've mentioned, honest placebos can help with things like the opioid crisis.""

He also argues that it is an ethical requirement for doctors to avoid nocebo effects - the negative effect of expecting something bad - adding that informing patients about all the possible negative side effects of their treatment is necessary. However, focusing exclusively on side effects without communicating the potential benefits of a treatment can induce the nocebo effect and put patients off from treatments that might help them.

Professor Howick points out that especially in clinical trials, patients are often provided with information about negative side effects and not told about the benefits their treatment might bring. This distorted communication can harm patients and needs to change, he says.

As his academic title suggests, Professor Howick promotes ""empathic communication"", so medical students are not just taught the facts about physiology, which he says can be more effective if practitioners take more time with patients.

""Look at the Francis Report [of the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust Public Inquiry] where so many patients died unnecessarily and look for the word 'empathy' in it. The report states the tragedies he details could have been avoided if a degree of empathy was pervasive within the trust.

A lack of empathy can be very, very unhelpful. Do not underestimate the importance of the therapeutic effects of interactions between health care practitioners and patients, in the context of care. It's a slog, but we're getting there.""

2024-02-01,"Shoaib Bashir, 20, to make England debut as James Anderson returns","The 20-year-old Somerset spinner, who finally arrived in India only last Sunday as the first Test was bubbling towards its incredible finale, replaces the injured Jack Leach. Jimmy Anderson, more than twice Bashir's age at 41, makes his first appearance of the series at the expense of Mark Wood as England again go with only one seamer.

England's three-pronged spin attack has three caps between them. Ahmed Rehan at 19 is the most experienced with two. Tom Hartley, the hero of Hyderabad on debut, has the other. Moreover, Bashir is the 99th England debutant since Anderson made his first appearance 21 years ago, taking a 5-fer against Zimbabwe.

England coach Brendon McCullum delivered the news. Stokes had a brief exchange on his way to the media centre. ""I went up to him,"" Stokes said. ""I knew that he knew, and he just gave me a big hug. I told him I was going to tell the media so he didn't have to keep it quiet. He looked very excited.""

Hartley's match-winning display in the opening Test with second innings figures of seven for 72 was reward for England's audacity. Stokes has similar faith in Bashir. ""It's great to be able to get Shoaib Bashir out there and give him his first game for England,"" Stokes said. ""I faced a lot of him in Abu Dhabi and some more this week as well. When you face someone with what you think is potential, it makes it even better.

""The thing he possesses is that natural ability, where he releases the ball from, how much energy he tries to put on the ball. Someone releasing the ball from height and putting that much on the ball is going to get that natural variation. That is very hard to play against out here. Some balls will skid on. I'm fully backing him, and looking forward to him going out on the field, hopefully putting on a good show.""

Though Stokes believes the pitch is more even than last week's he noted how much drier it was 24 hours after first setting eyes upon it on Wednesday and expects it turn soon enough, especially as the bowlers' feet tear holes in it.

After running in hard for 25 wicketless overs in Hyderabad, Wood gives way to Anderson almost on compassionate grounds. ""Woody's efforts last week were fantastic, given the placid nature of the pitch. What Woody does every time he steps on the field for England is give his absolute all, regardless of what he has got presented in front of him. He's always saying he'll run in all day for me, run in all day for the team.""

Anderson has looked sharp in the nets since touching down at the Abu Dhabi training camp last month. As well as experience and variety, Anderson offers his skipper a degree of control unavailable to Wood. ""What maybe goes under the radar is his record out in India. Considering what Jimmy is known for - 'the swing king' and all that - it just proves how good a bowler he is,"" Stokes said. ""He has different skillsets that I will be able to exploit in Indian conditions. It's not just picking Jimmy for the new ball, it's the other stuff he possesses as well.""

With no timeline yet for Leach's return, Bashir's selection takes on even greater significance. England are investing in what appears so far to be a temperament suited to the big occasion, even if the sample is small. Keeping Sir Alastair Cook quiet on his championship debut in June last year was impressive, but nothing like the challenge that awaits him here.

Leach, just back from a long lay-off with a fractured vertebrae, faces a period of uncertainty, which might yet become a real concern for England if India respond as they did in 2021, recovering from defeat in the first Test to overwhelm England in a 3-1 series win. ""I can't say how long he's going to be out for,"" Stokes said. ""Our medical team are looking after Leachy, assessing it every day. One thing he was keen to get over was that we may have lost a player but gained a coach. He's a very upbeat person. He's taken this in his stride considering how frustrating this would be for him. He's a very popular member of the group, very important to us on the field and off the field. He's happy as he possibly can be, even though he's injured.","20-year-old Somerset spinner makes his first appearance of the series against India.

2024-02-01,How to watch Premier League Darts - and what time Luke Littler plays,"The Premier League returns for 2024 with two new faces - Luke Littler and Luke Humphries

The Premier League Darts tournament spans 17 weeks and seven countries, starting in Wales before heading in Germany.

It is an invitation-only event, with just eight players taking part each year.

This year's line-up includes six former world champions and seven of the current top eight players in the world rankings.

The odd man out is 17-year-old Luke Littler, who will take headline billing in each of these tournaments having taken the sporting world by storm in his incredible run to the World Championship final.

How to watch Premier League Darts 2024

Every match of the 2024 Premier League will be available to watch on Sky Sports and NOW TV in the UK.

You will be able to watch the matches on Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports Arena, as well as the NOW TV app on phone or tablet and the website on laptops or computers.

There will be seven matches each night of the 16 regular tournament events, starting at 7pm and finishing no later than 11pm, always on a Thursday.

The first night is in Cardiff, before games in Berlin, Glasgow and various other cities across the United Kingdom, Ireland and the Netherlands.

The final will take place at London's O2 Arena on Thursday 23 May.

When does Luke Littler play in Cardiff?

The opening night of the Premier League will take place at Cardiff's Utilita Arena on 1 February 2024.

Play begins at 7pm and Littler's quarter-final against Luke Humphries will be the fourth match of the night.

The first is Peter Wright vs Rob Cross, then Gerwyn Price vs Nathan Aspinall, before reigning champions Michael van Gerwen plays Michael Smith.

Every Premier League match, except on the final night, is first to six legs, meaning games should last anywhere between 15 and 30 minutes.

This means Littler is unlikely to play his first match before 8pm on Thursday, but could play as late as 9pm.

If he progresses to the semi-final and final, expect these games to take place anywhere between 8.30pm and 10.30pm.","The Premier League Darts tournament spans 17 weeks and seven countries.

2024-02-01,Luke Littler is bored of kebabs,"No more kebabs and a Welsh hideaway - inside Luke Littler's first few months of fame

It's less than a month since his World Championship final defeat, but this feels like a different Luke Littler. Sharper haircut, new sponsors, more weathered demeanour. He already seems too old for this shit, and it's only just begun.

Littler is about to embark on his maiden Premier League campaign, an invitation-only tournament across 17 nights, contested by eight of the world's best players. Since his first match at Alexandra Palace Palace, he's already beaten five of the world's top eight players, including three en route to becoming the youngest person to win a senior PDC title at the Bahrain Masters. He hit the second nine-darter in World Series history in his quarter-final win over Nathan Aspinall, in just his tenth leg as a full-time pro.

Littler has lost just one of his eight games since the World Championship - a Dutch Masters final defeat to Michael van Gerwen, who he beat in Manama. Even then, he averaged 106.71, the highest losing average in a television final since 2017.

And now he's at Cardiff's Principality Stadium, the main event in town just three days before Wales' Six Nations opener here. No questions about kebabs, we're told. He's moving away from kebabs.

He said recently he didn't have one for two weeks after his first one at the World Championship. When he first espoused his affinity for doner meat, he perhaps didn't realise quite how intricately it would become interlinked with brand Littler. There's more to him than just kebabs.

One of the first things you notice is a change of sponsors on his garish purple top. Rochdale's Prestige Building Supplies are out, Boohoo Man, part of billion-dollar fast-fashion brand Boohoo, are in.

Skoda Warrington are still there, but you get the sense that may not be for long when he's asked whether he's sampled their wares since turning 17: ""I think I will buy my own car. No offence to Skoda.""

His shoes and upper back are still available for sponsorship, if you're interested. Even at 17, he's still too young to advertise Premier League sponsors BetMGM, who let him choose a sponsor of his own.

He selected the Motor Neurone Disease (MND) association, explaining: ""It's for Rob Burrow, the former Leeds rugby league player. I haven't met him but I know what he's going through for the past many years. I am from Warrington.

""I know what he's been through. I have seen clips of how good he was. It was my choice of charity.""

Littler claims his biggest purchase with his £200,000 World Championship purse was in-game points for EAFC, the Fifa successor, with his best ""pack"" Thierry Henry. There's an unmissably shiny gold watch on his wrist which suggests he may not be telling the whole truth.

But you can tell the sheer weight of it all is affecting Littler. His highlight of the past month? ""Chilling. When I do get a day off, I just use it. That is what I want to do. Sleep, a lot.""

He claims he doesn't practice in between tournaments, just using the two World Series events as warm-up for the Premier League.

And that's no surprise. Littler has been pulled from pillar to post and back again, a content-creating leviathan wanted by everyone. There are now Luke Littler Valentine's Day cards and a signature ""Luke Wrap"" at his local kebab house. His personalised darts sold out in under 20 minutes and he signed 1,050 EAFC posters with his face on at the Dutch Masters.

Manchester United have toured Littler round the players and had him at games, where he was pictured with Sir Alex Ferguson in a knitted sweater and chinos some way from his familiar Under Armour tracksuits. He even played darts against Harry Maguire and Christian Eriksen, hitting 180 to beat both three darts into a nine-dart challenge.

But you also see what United are getting out of this - the Instagram post of him and Sir Alex got 763,000 likes. Littler himself has 1.1m followers, more than twice the second-highest dartist in Van Gerwen. Like any 16-year-old, he loved providing updates on his following throughout the World Championship, but he's already falling victim to it. Everyone from Warrington Wolves to YouTuber boxing have already had the same idea.

And ask not just what darts has done for Littler, but what Littler has done for darts. Since the World Championship, the sport's popularity has continued to soar. Darts clubs are rammed, as are their academies.

Viagogo have said they've had a 204 per cent increase in ticket sales for the Premier League compared to last year. Nearly five million people watched the final at Ally Pally.

The players feel it too. Michael Smith thanked Littler for boosting the sport's revenue on his kids' behalf. Peter Wright said Littler has inspired him to get rid of his old darts and trophies, to start with a fresh passion for the game. Van Gerwen, in his inimitably ungrateful manner, said: ""Welcome to the big boys.""

Littler's reply? ""Surely, I am one of them now! I have joined them in the big boys league.""

His accession to the Premier League is one of a thousand changes in Littler's life, but he remains adamant he is still the same man: ""This is what I am, I am just myself. This is how I have been for many years.

""I will continue being myself. I don't need to get anything big about myself. I will just stay level-headed.""

But that isn't true, and it can't be true. He wouldn't be human if it were. He now signs his name ""the Nuke"", a sign his darting persona is already starting to infringe on his own.

After returning home after the World Championship, his family were so hounded by the press that they escaped for a week's holiday in a house on a hill in the Welsh countryside. His heroes at United and Warrington now want photos with him. He recently celebrated only being spotted by three people when out for a Chinese in St Helens for his 17th birthday.

His relationship with 21-year-old Eloise Milburn has been heavily scrutinised too, with Littler having to defend it shortly after the Worlds after six weeks of dating, at 16 years old. More than 3,000 people watched the two play EAFC together on TikTok earlier this week. Everything she now posts on social media becomes a tabloid article.

World champion Luke Humphries has said the senior pros should all put an arm around Littler, protect him from the big bad world.

But Wright and Van Gerwen disagreed, as did the man himself: ""I don't really want any advice off any of these players, I know they have been there and done it.

""But for some reason, if I do start struggling then I will speak to my mum and dad, see who they can speak to - maybe a sports psychology guy.

""I just keep myself to myself, do my practice routines and if it doesn't start working out, then something will have to change.""

Littler's first match in Cardiff is against Humphries, who he beat in the Netherlands last week, recovering from a 4-2 leg deficit to win 6-5. A potential semi-final could bring his third match against Van Gerwen in as many weeks.

Premature entry into the Premier League has broken players before, but there is currently nothing to suggest Littler will be next. At this rate, everything away from the oche is much more of a worry.","Luke Littler is about to embark on his maiden Premier League campaign.

2024-02-01,Nobody cares about Messi vs Ronaldo being postponed - except the Saudis,"Messi's Inter Miami will now face Aymeric Laporte's Al-Nassr on Thursday evening in the Riyadh Season Cup, an exhibition event created to boost tourism in Saudi Arabia and also, more importantly, give Ronaldo and Messi ""the ultimate duel"". That hasn't gone to plan.

The first Riyadh Season Cup was ""contested"" between Messi's Paris Saint-Germain and a Ronaldo-led ""Riyadh Season XI"" in January 2023, when PSG TV told fans to ""appreciate their Goatness"". Then 90 minutes of half-pace football with the twin aims of driving engagement and not getting injured reminded us that was then, and this is now.

Nine goals were scored and not one meant anything or really mattered. This was sport stripped of its significance, an artificially created spectacle geared at entertaining rather than competing. The 2024 edition won't even have the fading traces of the Messi-Ronaldo axis to fall back on.

How can Messi playing football feel so meaningless, so hollow, so futile? For nearly 20 years, everything he did meant something. It mattered. He mattered.

Everything was a first, then a best, then a most, then a last. As time disappeared, you increasingly treasured every moment, aware this sporting sorcery was finite.

What if we never saw that again? What if we didn't appreciate just how fortunate we were to be allowed into the time and space and spirit of someone who could make something so fundamentally insignificant appear to supersede life itself? For a period, the very notion was unfathomable and downright disrespectful.

Now? Not so much.

We've said our goodbyes. There was the last game for Barcelona, the last Champions League goal, the last World Cup match. We'll always have Qatar, but if all funerals took place repeatedly at varying intervals across a five-year period, not only would the impact markedly lessen, you'd never get anything done.

And so to Saudi Arabia, home of apathetic football played by apparently unwilling mercenaries. Messi has already played once in the Gulf this week, scoring a penalty in a 4-3 defeat to Al-Hilal. In more interesting news, he's fully shaven for the first time in years, making him appear oddly reminiscent of Messi at his best, 91 goals in a calendar year Messi, as if perhaps he actually can stop time. Spoiler alert: he can't.

Messi is also already the face of Visit Saudi, leading their most recent advertising campaign as he tells viewers what he loves about Saudi Arabia and to ""go beyond what you think"", alongside the slogan ""tourism opens minds"".

Now, Ronaldo's absence will at least lessen the impact of this Saudi advertising campaign dressed up as a football match, but did anyone really care in the first place?

What Saudi Arabian executives fail to appreciate, either in the Pro League or in football-esque exhibitions like this one, is that you can't recreate the tension and value of professional football without both genuine competition and the meaning behind it, the human histories, the organic emotional connection. Despite the narratives and force-fed discourse and celebrity mania shoehorned into the modern sporting universe, it is still the sport itself which sustains the whole enterprise.

As David Beckham and Inter Miami have done, you can reunite a 36-year-old Messi and 37-year-old Luis Suarez, even chuck in 35-year-old Sergio Busquets and 34-year-old Jordi Alba, but all you get is a reminder of what once was, of what we've lost, a vessel for nostalgia and little else.

The Riyadh Season Cup is an example of the Saudis trying to stop time, to prolong this magic so they can continue exploiting it to advertise holidays in Dammam. It's an attempt to perform cosmetic surgery on football, to overcome the great battle against ageing, a nip here and a tuck there and Messi and Ronaldo sort of look like they always did. Except you look closer, and they don't, and now they can't move their eyebrows, and Ronaldo's calves aren't as durable as they once were.

Only two demographics really wanted to watch this post-decline iteration of Messi vs Ronaldo - children who never got to see them in their primes and those who love athletes as celebrities.

But these competitions still fail to appreciate why people love football, how and why it evokes such depth of emotion, what the nostalgia is actually for. We adored Messi and Ronaldo because they made us feel like we were privy to momentary perfection.

Now their once world-stopping rivalry boils down to memories and a Visit Saudi billboard, to the Riyadh Season Cup and a Louis Vuitton advert, hollow monuments to former greatness.

And there's a lot more to come. Both Messi and Ronaldo are still under contract by the next Riyadh Season Cup, enough time for the last, last, last dance. The money is too good for these proxy football exhibitions not to become regular. It's only a matter of time before Newcastle get dragged in.

The future is now, and it's depressing, and it's taking place at the Kingdom Stadium, Saudi Arabia.","Messi's Inter Miami will now face Al-Nassr in the Riyadh Season Cup. the event was created to boost tourism in Saudi Arabia and give Ronaldo and Messi a ""ultimate duel"" Messi has scored 91 goals in a calendar year and is fully shaven for the first time.","[('messi', 0.5408), ('ronaldo', 0.4568), ('inter', 0.4403), ('riyadh', 0.3941), ('miami', 0.3849), ('saudi', 0.3849), ('nassr', 0.3491), ('cup', 0.3484), ('arabia', 0.345), ('goals', 0.3203)]","messi, ronaldo, inter, riyadh, miami, saudi, nassr, cup, arabia, goals",10
2024-02-01,i morning briefing: How serious is the measles outbreak?,"Measles was eradicated from Britain in 2017 - so why is has this crisis unfolded now?

When Walsall mum Davina noticed her three-month-old baby, Ezra, had a slight cold, she wasn't particularly worried. ""He just started to groan a bit, making a strange noise that he's never really made before,"" she told i. ""But we weren't really concerned. We just thought he'd started to do something new."" However Ezra soon developed a spotty rash which spread rapidly, covering his whole body. Their baby had measles. The family rushed him to hospital as his symptoms worsened, developing breathing difficulties and pneumonia. After six days in hospital, during which he had to undergo serious medical procedures, Ezra recovered. Davina doesn't know how her baby contracted measles, but their region, particularly Birmingham, has seen the most cases in recent months. It was not that long ago - in 2017 - that the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared Britain had eradicated measles. Just over a year later, that status was removed. Now, parts of the country are being gripped by outbreaks, and the WHO says there has been a 45-fold increase in cases across Europe in a year. Why has this happened, and are there fears it could lead to a rise in any other diseases? We'll take a look, after the headlines.

Today's news, and why it matters

People have reported getting sick nearly 30 times after visiting the beach at the heart of a legal battle between a swimmer and her water company. Gastroenteritis was the most common illness reported last year by those taking a dip at the popular seaside resort of Exmouth.

Around 40,000 XL Bully dogs have beaten the ban which comes into force across England and Wales today, aimed at clamping down on the dangerous breed involved in a string of fatal attacks. Anyone found in possession of an American XL Bully could face criminal proceedings and an unlimited fine unless their animal is registered as exempt.

The SNP's electoral chances are likely to have been dented further by the continuing controversy engulfing Nicola Sturgeon, polling experts have said. While the party's popularity had already begun to fall before Ms Sturgeon resigned as leader a year ago, that decline will have been accelerated by the row over SNP finances and the revelations at the Covid inquiry about her handling of the pandemic, they argued.

Clinically vulnerable people have voiced concerns after being turned down for an additional Covid booster despite studies showing a new jab is more effective against the dominant JN.1 strain. People who have serious health conditions or are immunosuppressed and remain at higher risk from infections such as Covid say they were turned down for the latest generation of Covid vaccine, having received a booster jab earlier in the rollout.

A woman and her two young children have been taken to hospital after a man threw a suspected corrosive substance at them in south London, police have said. A man was seen fleeing the scene and no arrests have been made.

Three key questions on the rise in measles:

How big is the rise in cases? Figures from UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) show there were 1,603 suspected cases of measles in England and Wales in 2023, a dramatic rise from 735 cases in 2022 and 360 in 2021. The West Midlands, particularly Birmingham, has seen the most cases in recent months - with more than 200 since last October according to latest data. There have also been smaller outbreaks of the disease in parts of London and clusters of cases in other areas of England. According to NHS England, almost 3.5 million children under the age of 16 (that's roughly a quarter of the population of children) are unprotected and at risk of becoming ill from the infections. Experts are now warning tens of thousands of measles cases could erupt in the UK this year. In Europe, 42,200 cases were reported by member states in 2023, almost 45 times the 941 cases in 2022. Measles can start off with cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, sneezing, and a cough and normally clears up within seven to 10 days. But it can lead to complications including pneumonia, meningitis, blindness and seizures. It can also result in lifelong disability and death. Mum Davina said: ""We were so shocked at how bad Ezra got quite quickly. As soon as the rash appeared, within an hour or two it had spread everywhere.

""Adults can also suffer complications including ear infections, pneumonia and encephalitis,"" Professor Lawrence Young, a virologist at Warwick University, told i.

Why has it spiralled? Figures last year showed the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine uptake had fallen to a 12-year-low. Last July, MMR vaccine rates in London dropped to just 70 per cent. It is believed practical issues that disproportionately impact lower socio-economic groups are thought to be one of the key reasons behind falling uptake. This includes the cost of travelling to a clinic, difficulties in arranging childcare for other children, and competing demands for parents' time. The pandemic is likely to also have had an effect, public health experts believe. Recently Professor Stuart Neil, head of the department of infectious diseases at King's College London told The Guardian: ""Vaccine uptake has fallen across the board over the pandemic partly because of hesitancy to go to doctors during it,"" he said. The WHO says the rising trend is expected to continue if people do not vaccinate their children. Misinformation has also been cited as helping fuel anti-vax beliefs. An analysis found TikTok videos of mothers attributing the MMR vaccine to children developing tics, autism, seizures and medical emergencies requiring hospital treatment. These claims are unsubstantiated and stories of babies becoming unwell are unverified. On Facebook, groups geared towards vaccine-hesitant parents see users referring to the jab as ""cupcake"", ""v@ccines"", or emojis such as the cupcake or syringe, to avoid content moderation.

Could it mean a rise in other diseases? With a drop in the uptake of the MMR jab, experts say there could be a rise in the other two illnesses for which that vaccine protects - mumps and rubella. ""The drop in MMR vaccinations since the early 2000s means that mumps and rubella outbreaks are likely to follow measles - unless the trend in decreasing MMR coverage is reversed,"" Professor Steve Griffin, of Leeds University, told.

Around the world

The most unlikely battle of the upcoming US Presidential election, and a potentially pivotal one, is shaping up as Donald Trump locks horns with Taylor Swift, the world's biggest pop star. Members of Trump's inner circle have already assigned Swift a prominent position on his list of most significant foes.

Iranian officials and its media have threatened the US with a strong response to anticipated strikes in the wake of a deadly attack on a US base in Jordan, while also signalling an interest in de-escalation. The commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) said that the regime is ""not afraid"" of war with the US.

Houthi rebels in Yemen claim to have struck a US merchant ship in the Red Sea in a fresh attack targeting commercial shipping. Meanwhile, the US has launched new air strikes in Yemen, targeting 10 drones reportedly being set up to launch.

Sweden's prime minister condemned ""an attempted attack"" against the Israeli embassy in Stockholm, after an object found outside it was destroyed by the bomb squad. Police said a ""live"" device had been found by staff on the embassy premises on Wednesday, calling it ""a dangerous object"", although they did not specify what it was.

The public in Canada are being asked to look out for a giant stuffed taxidermy polar bear, after it went missing from a resort. The 225kg Arctic beast is believed to have been stolen from a resort in early January when temperatures were near -30C.

Watch out for...

Donald Trump, who will find out whether his High Court claim over allegations he took part in ""perverted"" sex acts and gave bribes to Russian officials can continue.

2024-02-01,i morning briefing: How serious is the measles outbreak?,"Measles was eradicated from Britain in 2017 - so why is has this crisis unfolded now?

When Walsall mum Davina noticed her three-month-old baby, Ezra, had a slight cold, she wasn't particularly worried. ""He just started to groan a bit, making a strange noise that he's never really made before,"" she told i. ""But we weren't really concerned. We just thought he'd started to do something new."" However Ezra soon developed a spotty rash which spread rapidly, covering his whole body. Their baby had measles. The family rushed him to hospital as his symptoms worsened, developing breathing difficulties and pneumonia. After six days in hospital, during which he had to undergo serious medical procedures, Ezra recovered. Davina doesn't know how her baby contracted measles, but their region, particularly Birmingham, has seen the most cases in recent months. It was not that long ago - in 2017 - that the World Health Organization declared Britain had eradicated measles. Just over a year later, that status was removed. Now, parts of the country are being gripped by outbreaks, and the WHO says there has been a 45-fold increase in cases across Europe in a year. Why has this happened, and are there fears it could lead to a rise in any other diseases? We'll take a look, after the headlines.

Today's news, and why it matters

People have reported getting sick nearly 30 times after visiting the beach at the heart of a legal battle between a swimmer and her water company. Gastroenteritis was the most common illness reported last year by those taking a dip at the popular seaside resort of Exmouth.

Around 40,000 XL bully dogs have beaten the ban which comes into force across England and Wales today, aimed at clamping down on the dangerous breed involved in a string of fatal attacks. Anyone found in possession of an American XL bully could face criminal proceedings and an unlimited fine unless their animal is registered as exempt.

The SNP's electoral chances are likely to have been dented further by the continuing controversy engulfing Nicola Sturgeon, polling experts have said. While the party's popularity had already begun to fall before Ms Sturgeon resigned as leader a year ago, that decline will have been accelerated by the row over SNP finances and the revelations at the Covid inquiry about her handling of the pandemic, they argued.

Clinically vulnerable people have voiced concerns after being turned down for an additional Covid booster despite studies showing a new jab is more effective against the dominant JN.1 strain. People who have serious health conditions or are immunosuppressed and remain at higher risk from infections such as Covid say they were turned down for the latest generation of Covid vaccine, having a received a booster jab earlier in the rollout.

A woman and her two young children have been taken to hospital after a man threw a suspected corrosive substance at them in south London, police have said. A man was seen fleeing the scene and no arrests have been made.

Three key questions on the rise in measles:

How big is the rise in cases? Figures from UKHSA show there were 1,603 suspected cases of measles in England and Wales in 2023, a dramatic rise from 735 cases in 2022 and 360 in 2021. The West Midlands, particularly Birmingham, has seen the most cases in recent months - with more than 200 since last October according to latest data. There have also been smaller outbreaks of the disease in parts of London and clusters of cases in other areas of England. According to NHS England, almost 3.5 million children under the age of 16 (that's roughly a quarter of the population of children) are unprotected and at risk of becoming ill from the infections. Experts are now warning tens of thousands of measles cases could erupt in the UK this year. In Europe, 42,200 cases were reported by member states in 2023, almost 45 times the 941 cases in 2022. Measles can start off with cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, sneezing, and a cough and normally clears up within seven to 10 days. But it can lead to complications including pneumonia, meningitis, blindness and seizures. It can also result in lifelong disability and death. Mum Davina told: ""We were so shocked at how bad Ezra got quite quickly. As soon as the rash appeared, within an hour or two it had spread everywhere. To be honest I had no idea measles could make babies so ill. I thought they just had a cold and a rash."" Read the full story here. Measles can also be serious in adults.

2024-02-01,What really happens to your body when you drink again after having a month off,"You've done Dry January and you're ready to celebrate. Here's what's going on inside you when you welcome back the hard stuff, and how to mitigate the damage

So you've made it to the end of January without a single drop of alcohol passing your lips. Congratulations! Dry January is a genuinely tough feat, particularly in the greyest month of the year. You may even have some health benefits to boast about: deeper sleep, plumper skin and better memory are just some of the perks people experience when not drinking.

If you're looking forward to your first post-work pint on 1 February, you're probably wondering what will actually happen when alcohol re-enters your bloodstream. More importantly, can you somehow hold onto all the advantages of abstinence while having a few? We asked the experts.

The main physiological change from a period of abstinence is in your brain, explains Dr David McLaughlan, consultant psychiatrist from The Priory and a specialist in addictions.

Alcohol, when we drink regularly, turns up the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, which are our main inhibitory transmitters. When this system is turned up it leads to feeling drowsy, warm and uninhibited. But, as Dr McLaughlan explains, ""after a period of abstinence, even if it's only a couple of weeks, the GABA receptors will have become desensitised, meaning all of the effects they mediate will happen quicker"".

In practical terms this means you can tolerate far, far less than you used to.

""If over Christmas they were able to drink a bottle of wine over dinner, they're not going to be able to do that after Dry January. They're going to get drunk much quicker and are more likely to have blackouts.""

All other changes will come from the way your body always metabolises alcohol - but you will feel the impacts more significantly after some time off.

For example, alcohol is a diuretic. This is why, when you stop drinking, your skin tends to be clearer (""better hydration means your skin is less wrinkly and saggy"", as Dr McLaughlan puts it). When you start drinking again you will need to pass urine more in the short term. In the long term, that dehydration is what leads to hangover headaches and tired and dull skin. You may also quickly notice a return to more disturbed sleep. Giving up alcohol gains you on average five or six REM sleep cycles per night, says Dr McLaughlan, ""so when you go back to drinking you'll likely notice your concentration is worse during the day, it's hard to function and you feel less refreshed"".

Alcohol also irritates the lining of your gut and stomach, leading to heartburn and irregular bowels. When drinking is added back into the mix, any positive impact you will have had on your gut health, such as a recovered microbiome or going more regularly, will also be lost.

So your tolerance is significantly lower, and the negative health impacts are just as present the moment you start drinking. But there are some steps you can take to mediate these impacts.

A month of sobriety means you won't need to drink very much to feel the effects. Dr McLaughlan emphasises the need for moderation if you are going to celebrate the end of Dry January with some drinking. Stagger your drinking with water or a soft beverage between each drink, and aim to remain within the recommended limits (14 units of alcohol per week, spread over three days or more - so no more than four to five units in a day).

Completing Dry January is absolutely worth celebrating, but Dr McLaughlan recommends taking it as an opportunity to find other ways to reward yourself and celebrate that do not involve alcohol. What is something you regularly deny yourself (for example, a lie-in or an overpriced piece of cake) that you could give yourself so booze isn't the only way you celebrate?

Karen Tyrell, CEO of Drink Aware, says that it is important to work out why you want to start drinking again. ""Is it social drinking because you want to be in social environment and share in that moment with loved ones? Is it emotional drinking to cope with a bad day? Is it celebratory drinking, the other end of the emotional drinking spectrum? Or is it just habit?"" This can then shape how you drink in the future.

The euphoria of those GABA receptors relaxing may tempt you to think you can handle more, but that road leads to bingeing and blackouts. And that includes trying to find loopholes. ""Make sure you're thinking about the low-risk guidelines from the chief medical officer, which is to aim to not drink more than 14 units a week, have several days in a week where you're not drinking and don't save up all those units for one binge-drinking session.""

Ultimately, though, there's no cheat code, says Dr McLaughlan. ""If you enjoyed the benefits of Dry January and the benefits of no alcohol, the only way to continue to enjoy those benefits is to continue to be abstinent."" The choice is yours - and if it's to have a saggy face after a euphoric night on the town, so be it.","Alcohol turns up the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in your brain. This is why, when you stop drinking, your skin tends to be clearer. Alcohol also irritates the lining of your stomach, leading to heartburn and irregular bowels.","[('heartburn', 0.4063), ('alcohol', 0.3524), ('stomach', 0.3224), ('drinking', 0.2832), ('irritates', 0.2306), ('bowels', 0.2273), ('receptors', 0.1873), ('acid', 0.1728), ('aminobutyric', 0.1384), ('irregular', 0.1142)]","heartburn, alcohol, stomach, drinking, irritates, bowels, receptors, acid, aminobutyric, irregular",-1
2024-02-01,Encephalitis symptoms as UK warned over impact of measles outbreak,"If the 3.4 million children unprotected against measles did not get vaccinated against it, around 10,000 new cases of encephalitis could emerge, a charity has warned.

A leading global charity has warned that the UK should be primed for an imminent surge in cases of encephalitis, during the latest measles outbreak.

Encephalitis is a life-threatening brain swelling disease that can be caused by measles.

Encephalitis International (EI) said that if the 3.4 million children unprotected against measles in the UK did not get vaccinated against it, around 10,000 new cases of encephalitis could emerge - potentially resulting in around 1,500 deaths and leaving thousands with irreversible brain injuries.

The charity is urging parents and carers of children with measles to seek urgent medical assistance if they spot the telltale signs of encephalitis, which include drowsiness, confusion and seizures. The charity is also calling all healthcare professionals in the UK and globally to consider encephalitis when symptomatic patients present.

Encephalitis is an uncommon but serious condition in which the brain becomes inflamed or swollen. It can be life-threatening and requires urgent treatment in hospital. Anyone can be affected, but the very young and very old are most at risk.

Encephalitis usually starts off with flu-like symptoms, such as a high temperature and headache. More serious symptoms come on over hours, days or weeks, including: confusion or disorientation, seizures or fits, changes in personality and behaviour, difficulty speaking, weakness or loss of movement in some parts of the body, and/or loss of consciousness.

Encephalitis needs to be treated in a hospital. The earlier treatment is started, the more successful it's likely to be. Treatment depends on the underlying cause, but may include: antiviral medicines, steroid injections or treatments to help control the immune system.

Some people eventually make a full recovery from encephalitis, although this can be a long and frustrating process. Many people never make a full recovery and are left with long-term problems caused by damage to their brain.

Common complications include: memory loss (amnesia), frequent seizures or fits, personality and behavioural changes, problems with attention, concentration, planning and problem solving, and persistent tiredness.

It is not always possible to prevent encephalitis, but some of the infections that cause it can be prevented with vaccinations, such as the MMR [measles, mumps and rubella] vaccine.

EI's warning echoes that made by Professor Tom Solomon, chair of Neurology at the University of Liverpool and director of The Pandemic Institute. Earlier this week he said that unless more children were vaccinated against measles, up to 1,500 could lose their lives to encephalitis.

He said: ""It is a tragedy that in 2024, we have measles in the UK. Inevitably, there will be children who develop measles encephalitis and are at risk of death or brain damage.

""This disease is completely preventable by vaccination. We must do everything we can to get people vaccinated.""

Just under 350 measles cases have been confirmed since 1 October last year, with three-quarters reported in the West Midlands, latest figures show. The ongoing outbreak in the West Midlands ""remains a concern"" the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said.

Dr Vanessa Saliba, UKHSA's consultant epidemiologist, said: ""MMR vaccine coverage has been falling for the last decade, with one out of 10 children starting school in England not protected, and so there is a real risk that this outbreak could spread to other towns and cities.

""Measles is a nasty illness for most children and, for some, can be serious, but it is completely preventable.""

She added: ""Vaccination is the best way to protect yourself and your children. If you or your child are not up to date with your two doses of MMR vaccine, please contact your GP to catch up now.""","Encephalitis International warns that the UK should be primed for an imminent surge in cases of encephalitis.

2024-02-01,We fled Brexit for an Italian farm with no electricity or hot water,"The British-Italian pair in 2020 bought an old farm where they grow fresh produce, including huge pumpkins, and aromatic herbs for essential oils.

But the pair were plunged into a life that was far more back-to-basics than they had expected. For months after they moved in, they had no hot water and had to heat it outside on a campfire and bring it upstairs with buckets to take a wash.

They had no electricity, using candles and torches to navigate their new farm, and had to redo the entire old electric system, which was covered in ivy and bushes.

Yet the couple still insist it was one of the happiest times of their lives, and say they felt relieved to have the opportunity for a fresh start and a new life.

""I still remember the first night we moved in, eating a sandwich on the floor in a cold and empty room with candles, as the best happy memory,"" says Nathan Mann, a 37-year-old former builder from Portsmouth.

""The trigger that pushed us to think about leaving the UK was Brexit, which we never agreed with,"" adds Giulia Lo Pinto, 36, a former nurse.

""Brexit was based on the idea of division, while in our opinion the only way to have progress and prevent conflicts is through union.""

They also wanted to get away from London's rat race.

""We were fed up by a life where you work most of the time, have no time to do what you like or even to cook your own food, let alone grow it!"" says Ms Lo Pinto, who was born in the Italian Alpine town of Bolzano. ""You become so frustrated that you think that spending money on things and meals out is the only way to find some happiness.""

She and her fiance now happily live in Santa Maria di Burano, a hamlet near Gubbio with a handful of residents. In preparation for this summer, they added two rooms for occasional guests looking to live the bucolic life.

The couple breed 26 poultry including free-range chickens and keep beehives for making honey, candles and natural cosmetics.

They love the silence, waking up to the sounds of nature, breathing fresh air instead of London's smog, seeing deer and wolves in the garden, and playing with baby goats and butterflies.

Living in a tiny hamlet has its challenges. They shop just once or twice a week to save fuel and have become used to unplugged days.

""If we forget something (and we do always) we have to go without! If it does snow, it can happen that there's no electricity or internet,"" says Mr Mann.

Their simple, old-fashioned world is a stark contrast to their hectic life back in the UK.

Ms Lo Pinto says working as a NHS nurse was not an easy job, and ""if you are an empathetic person it's even worse, mixed with the long shifts and the fact that it wasn't my country made it very stressful for me. The rewards from the patients unfortunately weren't enough to make me feel happy and fulfilled.""

Mr Mann, who used to work for 12 hours straight, says what got to him was ""the constant grind"" and the feeling that ""outside of work I was building nothing"".

The couple wanted change from a lifestyle and routine that wasn't making them happy any more.

They dreamed of being self-sufficient by growing their own food and making a living out of their ""bon sauvage"" ideals.

The farmhouse, called The Butterflies Rest, was fairly cheap, says Lo Pinto, though she prefers not to disclose the price. They mostly restyled it themselves to save money.

Mr Mann says returning to England ""would be disastrous, as one of our driving forces in harder times was that we outright refused failure"".","British-Italian couple Nathan Mann and Giulia Lo Pinto bought an old farm in 2020.

2024-02-01,My dog's so anxious we put him on Prozac - and it worked,"Despite all our training, our cockapoo became unpredictable and stressed - antidepressants have calmed him down

Once a month, you'll find me standing in a queue at the Boots pharmacy, looking slightly uncomfortable and mentally rehearsing my lines, anticipating an awkward conversation. I'm here to pick up a prescription for the antidepressant fluoxetine (you may be more familiar with its brand name, Prozac), but it's not for me; it's for my dog, Chester.

The first time the pharmacist read out 'Chester Reed', I hoped they might just be envisaging a distinguished-looking gentleman here to collect his pills. Then they read the label again, I saw their eyes widen as they saw it was an animal prescription (since 2005 you've been able to get private prescriptions, including veterinary ones, from the pharmacy of your choice). I quickly launched into a convoluted explanation, a defence that I hoped would alleviate my sense of shame. ""Ahhhwwww, poor thing,"" they replied, looking at me with pity. The scene belonged in a sitcom; the parody of a hapless dog owner.

When I've told friends, their response has been a mix of riotous laughter and disbelief. Imagine the same response to a human telling you they are taking antidepressants. Yet, a dog? Ridiculous! I never intended to be this person. While many people get dogs on a whim, without a lot of thought (according to a Kennel club survey more than one in four people in the south of England bought their dog without having met it before) I was at the other extreme: acquiring Chester had been the result of months of intensive research.

I consulted a behaviourist at the outset, answering a myriad of questions to determine a suitable breed for my family. Despite my hankering for a Vizsla, we agreed on a cockapoo. They helped source reputable breeders and accompanied us to choose our puppy. We chose Chester, in 2018, because he wasn't the boisterous one, nor was he cowering in a corner. He was somewhere in the middle. And yet we've ended up with a dog so anxious that I'm now having to medicate him.

Of course, we aren't the only ones: research by the Royal Veterinary College revealed that 97 per cent of owners who acquired a dog during the 2020 pandemic reported behavioural problems. Chester is not part of the pandemic cohort, but he has taught me all too well the pains of living with an anxious dog. As I write this, he is sitting on my foot. It's where he seeks comfort - an anchor for him - if he's feeling a little unsettled.

What is so frustrating to me is that I felt we did everything to avoid getting to this point. We and our children - then eight, 11 and 15 - worked hard on recall, manners and, above all, socialisation. Chester and I could often be found on a bench in town watching the world go by along with its accompanying noises. I had a checklist of things he should see and hear, textures he should feel, varieties of people he should meet.

I would dash with him to catch the bin lorry, pop a balloon, slowly build up increments of time in which to leave him. I worried he hadn't seen cows or sheep and added them to my list. I attended training classes where we progressed through the levels. Arguably, this dog was more socialised than my three children. I was determined he was going to be bomb-proof, an exemplary canine in a human world. And yet.

Chester had always been on the more cautious end of the spectrum but, two years in, his behaviour became alarmingly unpredictable. Out on a walk, he became wired and skittish, lunging and barking at people and dogs. I couldn't narrow it down to a category such as old people with sticks or small dogs. It was random and therefore difficult to manage.

I became hyper-vigilant, my tension undoubtedly travelling down the lead to him, exacerbating the problem. This went on for several months until walks around town were replaced with a run on the common where it was quiet.

He started barking more at visitors to our house too, giving them a wide berth. I stopped inviting people for a while, preferring to meet them outside the house, again to reduce the stress. My dog was glitching and it didn't seem to be coinciding with a developmental phase. I went back to my behaviourist and broke down. I'd done everything by the book and yet I felt I had failed.

I also felt cheated, especially hearing from those who barely did any training. The behaviourist confirmed he seemed stressed and anxious. When a dog is in that state, flooded with stress hormones, they are incapable of listening to your commands.

They suggested it might be worth considering anti-anxiety medication in the form of fluoxetine, which would just take the edge off and help Chester cope with situations with which he struggled. He could be taken off it in due course, but some dogs are on it for life, subject to regular checks. After a check with the vet to rule out any underlying pain or physical condition that can also cause behavioural issues, I found myself three years ago in the Boots queue collecting the £11 a month prescription.

Caroline Wilkinson, a certified animal behaviourist and founder of Barket Place agrees that, in some scenarios, medication can help. ""When our dogs start to display any emotional distress, it's really important that we look at all angles to uncover why this new behaviour is occurring.

""It's important to get your dog checked out physically first to ensure no underlying health conditions, then obtain advice from an ethical behaviourist to guide you through a plan,"" she says. ""We can often make huge progress with our dog's emotions by changing elements of their environment, making dietary changes, and carefully created training strategies.""

Wilkinson herself looks at natural supplementation that can help reduce anxiety. ""In some cases, though, we do need to bring in pharmaceutical support to be able to kick-start our progress and reduce our dog's emotional distress. In these situations, you would work with your vet to find the right medication. It's important that dosage is selected for the individual dog. We're looking for a dog to feel calm, not 'knocked out'.

""Just like with humans, we shouldn't judge the use of pharmaceuticals in behaviour modification work with dogs. This is not just a quick-fix band-aid solution that your dog will be on for life, this is the kindest approach to help them cope now, while you help work on future associations.""

It's important that regular vet check-ups take place if a dog is on medication, notes Wilkinson, with an overall aim of gradually reducing and eventually removing the medication if suitable.

After trying all avenues and being sceptical at the outset, I have to say that it has helped Chester. Alongside training and taking things slowly, things started to improve within months of the new regime. We now walk through town and have regular visitors over. He still takes a toy with him for reassurance into the garden at night for his bedtime wee.

At a recent check-up with the vet, I asked whether I should start reducing the dose. They saw from the records that we had tried it once, but there had been a relapse, so advised that we continue for now as he is a much happier and less anxious dog. However, it's something I intend to keep under review. In the absence of Dr Doolittle, there are no talking therapies for dogs, who can be just as emotionally complex as humans, but there is help out there if you need it.","Caroline Wilkinson is a certified animal behaviourist and founder of Barket Place.

2024-02-01,"I'm in constant pain - so at 36, without children, I'm paying to have my womb removed","It took Evelyn Scott 15 years to get diagnosed with endometriosis. Now, the wait for treatment is so long she's crowdfunding to pay for it

In the UK, around 1.5 million women are currently living with endometriosis, a condition which develops when the tissue that resembles the part of the womb which sheds during menstruation is found outside of the womb. In 60 per cent of cases it's found in the ovaries leading to fertility issues. Other uncommon sites include the bowel, kidneys and lungs. For Everlyn Scott, her extreme endometriosis symptoms have led to an urgent need for action.

It took me 15 years to finally get diagnosed with endometriosis. By this point I was 30 years old and had lived half of my life in agonising pain, enduring periods which were so heavy and debilitating that I had to take a week off college (or work) every month, and in more recent years my symptoms led to regularly being admitted to A&E.

I lost count of the number of times medical professionals sent me home from the hospital, telling me I was just having a ""bad period"". But it was so bad I even dropped out of university because the pain had become too much. At that point I just felt totally defeated.

After years, the confirmation that my symptoms were due to endometriosis was a relief, but has sadly not led to any improvement in my quality of life. Despite undergoing three laparoscopic ablation surgeries [an operation in the abdomen with a small camera] to remove the growths, as well as hormone treatment, I'm still in constant daily pain which I manage with anti-inflammatory tablets and painkillers.

I also suffer from severe fatigue, the pain means that I suffer from anxiety and depression, and I can't make plans, because I never know how I am going to feel, which means that relationships suffer. I don't date, because sex is extremely painful. I just have to live each day as it comes.

I'm 36 now and life has become even more complicated - the growths have spread to my bowels (gastro conditions regularly accompany endometriosis when it has been left untreated for so long), which means I can't go to the toilet without laxatives and muscle relaxants. I spent most of Christmas 2023 in hospital, and have now lost the ability to eat solid foods without ending up in hospital. I'm fed up, and disheartened.

I had been managing my pain, but the humiliation and agony of severe constipation, faecal impaction and a bowel obstruction has been the final straw. I can't live like this. I'm emotionally and physically exhausted, and I'm struggling to cope. I just want my life back.

I'm on the NHS waiting list for hysterectomy surgery (to remove my uterus), but I had to fight for a referral and I've been told that in Farnborough, Hampshire, where I live, the waiting list is 18 months long. I can't wait that long. I've already been on the waiting list for a year. It's for this reason that I've set up a GoFundMe page to raise £9,000 I need to pay for a private hysterectomy and the aftercare.

This might seem like a drastic decision for someone of my age and I know it means I won't be able to have my own children. Sadly, endometriosis can affect fertility anyway, so I know that having children would be incredibly tough anyway.

Gynaecology waiting lists in England rose by 60 per cent during the pandemic - more sharply than in any other specialty, according to new data from the Royal College of Gynaecologists. In February 2020 the gynaecology waiting list in England was 286,008 but in January 2022, it was 456,938.

What is most important to me right now, is to have a life without pain. I want to be able to make plans again, and not worry about being unreliable. I'm too frightened to leave the house sometimes, because I worry that I will be suddenly struck by unbearable pain.

I don't want to spend another Christmas in the hospital. I want to live like a normal woman of my age. I want to write a novel and be more active again. I want to be able to eat solid food, without worrying that I'm going to end up in hospital with another blockage.

I know that a hysterectomy is not a 100 per cent cure but I'm hopeful that it will reduce my symptoms, especially the pain. The recovery will be hard, but worth it in the end. Separately I'll also need treatment to remove the endometriosis on my bowel. There's a risk that I might need a stoma bag, but I will be more comfortable and my hope is that it won't get any worse.

Since launching the funding page a lot of women in a similar situation have reached out to me. It's heartbreaking to hear their stories. I'm quite stubborn and willing to fight for my operation, but I know a lot of women may not feel they have the strength to do the same, which worries me. It's easy to forget how long-term physical illness can affect people's mental health too. I have certainly hit rock bottom in the past, and there's not enough support in place for those in similar positions.

On top of raising money for my hysterectomy (I've so far reached £7,300), I also want to raise awareness for other women in my position. No-one wants to discuss their bowel and period habits on the internet, but if it helps one person feel less alone, then I'll keep on talking. Women's health is not spoken about enough.

This week the results of a survey of 33 women by Manchester Metropolitan University found that women with endometriosis often feel ""gaslighted"" by medical professionals who dismiss their symptoms or appear to lack an understanding of the condition.

Dr Jasmine Hearn, senior lecturer in psychology, said: ""It's incredibly sad and completely unacceptable that women are forced to take such measures to get treatment, and reinforces the message that there are systemic issues leading to inequalities in access to treatment.

""Diagnosis delays, dismissal, stigma, along with the symptoms of endometriosis have a staggering impact on women's mental health and quality of life and need to be prioritised.""","1.5 million women in the UK are currently living with endometriosis.

2024-02-01,Three key factors that will determine whether house prices rise or fall in 2024,"Mortgage rates, the economy, Government policy and jobless figures all play a role in the direction the property market takes this year

Homebuyers and sellers will continue to keep a keen eye on the property market this year to see whether house prices will rise or fall after a tumultuous 2023.

It can be difficult to know exactly what is expected, especially as experts are split on whether prices will see a dip or an increase following a drop last year.

The average UK house price increased by 0.7 per cent month on month in January to £257,656, according to data from Nationwide published on Tuesday, suggesting a ""little more positive"" outlook for the property market, although prices were still lower than a year earlier.

Others are also predicting rises, with estate agency Knight Frank suggesting a 3 per cent increase on average during the coming year.

However, most experts predict some falls during 2024 with the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) predicting a 2.4 per cent decline.

What happens depends on a multitude of factors. Below, we run through what experts say are the biggest factors in determining where prices go this year.

Mortgage rates

Mortgage rates are a key factor behind recent price falls. At the end of 2023, the average two-year mortgage fix was priced at 5.93 per cent - far higher than the 2.34 per cent average two years prior.

Higher mortgage rates mean that it costs far more to borrow than it used to.

Although mortgage rates are now falling slightly - and some people with large equity in their homes can get rates of below 4 per cent - they are still not going to come anywhere near rates seen during the pandemic.

Cameron Misson, an economist at CEBR, said the organisation was forecasting price falls because of the projected impact of high mortgage rates on affordability.

""These will negatively impact housing demand and, in turn, exert downward pressure on house prices. Indeed, while mortgage rates have eased recently, they remain significantly higher than before the Bank of England's interest rate hikes,"" he said.

Richard Donnell, executive director of the Zoopla property portal, said whether mortgage rates were above or below 5 per cent for a typical borrower - someone taking out a five-year-fix with a 25 per cent deposit - was generally the ""tipping point"" which determined whether house prices fell or grew.

He said with rates between 4 and 5 per cent - as is the case now - very low growth, possibly below inflation, would likely occur. Once rates went below 4 per cent, bigger increases could happen, adding rates above 6 per cent would lead to far bigger house price falls.

The economy and unemployment figures

In addition to mortgage rates, the condition of the economy - including unemployment numbers and pay growth figures - has a large impact on house prices, as it determines whether people have enough money to pay for homes.

If there is a large amount of unemployment, people are also more likely to have sell because they cannot afford their mortgages, which can increase supply, and decrease costs.

""The housing market is an extension of the economy,"" explained Mr Donnell. ""The labour market being strong and high immigration have supported the demand side for housing to buying and renting.""

Currently though, economic forecasts suggest fairly flat growth over the next year. Pay increases are running higher than inflation at 6.6 per cent annually towards the end of last year.

Although unemployment is expected to grow, economists said this will likely be a relatively small increase on current trajectories, with Stephen Millard of The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) telling there will likely be a ""gentle"" increase this year.

Mr Misson of CEBR explains that current forecasts suggest the economy is remaining resilient, which is why its forecast for price falls are not more dramatic.

""The continued resilience of household incomes amidst the cost-of-living crisis is a potential determinant for the prevailing direction of house prices in 2024. Consumer confidence has remained fairly upbeat, despite facing a number of economic headwinds,"" he explains.

""The anticipated continued easing in inflation will contribute towards further real-term improvements in household incomes, and potentially aid the recovery in housing market activity.""

Government policies on housing and tax

""While housing affordability is relatively easy to model, sentiment is much more difficult to predict, being affected by factors such tax changes, housing policy and changing buyer demands,"" said Lucian Cooke, head of residential research at Savills estate agency.

With a Budget coming in March, and a general election later this year, possible policy changes would include the likes of cuts to stamp duty - a tax charged on property purchases - as well as other moves that affect demand.

For example, it was recently reported that the Government was considering backing lenders to create 99 per cent loan to value (LTV) mortgages - involving deposits of just 1 per cent - to allow people to buy a home with a deposit of just a few thousand pounds. Experts warned this could push prices up by increasing the number of people able to buy.

Anna Clarke of the Housing Forum said: ""As much as [these mortgages] can work at all, they can only do so by pushing prices higher.""

Longer term, policies that increase housing supply - such as large scale council house building - could also have an impact on prices, by either leading to reductions or limiting growth, though in the short-term, building on the scale that would change costs seems unlikely.

Mr Misson explained: ""There was a general trend of worsening supply towards the end of 2023. Should this trend continue to prevail, it might help to soften any potential falls in house prices this year. However, it is worth noting that readings have generally become less downbeat, and supply was flat for the latest data. Improvements in supply would have the reverse effect, serving to dampen the outlook for house prices.""","Mortgage rates, the economy, Government policy and jobless figures all play a role in the direction the property market takes this year. The average UK house price increased by 0.7% month on month in January to £257,656.

2024-02-01,"As a British Muslim, I'd rather spoil my ballot than vote Labour","What we are seeing is the desperate final flailing of a party no longer fit for purpose

Labour is in a panic as polling reveals that it is losing support among one of its most historically loyal bases: British Muslims. As the party now desperately attempts to claw back potential votes from a cohort long underestimated and taken for granted, I'm here to say that I think the issue is much, much worse for Labour than it imagines.

I have always voted Labour. As a British Muslim, I saw them as the party most likely to represent my needs and values. Of course, the party was never perfect (and I hasten to say I wasn't of voting age at the time of the Iraq war) but the narrative of them being the ""lesser of two evils"" prevailed among my friends, family and community. Collectively, we feared that a vote for anyone else was a vote for the Conservatives and that would result in a deliberately hostile environment for anyone without white skin or an English name. So, loyally and automatically, I have placed an X in the name of the Labour candidate in every election for the past decade.

But this time, it is different. And not just for me. Under Keir Starmer, Labour's Muslim vote was already haemorrhaging. In 2022, a study by Muslim Census found that Labour was at risk of losing half its Muslim vote, largely due to their inaction on Islamophobia. But Starmer's approach to Israel is something that cannot be forgotten or forgiven by those of us who recognise ourselves in the Gazans being killed and denied aid.

First came Starmer's assertion that Israel ""has the right"" to withhold water and fuel in Gaza, followed by desperate backtracking. (Starmer later clarified that Israel had a ""right to self-defence"" but insisted that this did not mean withholding essential aid to Gaza.) Then came an opportunistic visit to a Cardiff mosque, which Starmer tweeted about and, in the same post, called for the release of hostages, as though the congregation at a small Welsh mosque has Hamas on speed dial.

Next was Starmer's warning that he would sack frontbenchers who voted in favour of the ceasefire bill brought forward by the Scottish National Party (resulting in eight shadow ministers resigning and a revolt of 56 Labour MPs). In my mind this cemented the party's stance that it was against stopping the bombing of civilians, schools and hospitals. This was, of course, closely followed by Starmer then joining Rishi Sunak to call for what is being nonsensically termed a ""substantial humanitarian pause"" or more recently, a ""sustainable ceasefire"". But it is too little, too late for many British Muslims.

By the end of October 2023, only five per cent of British Muslims said they would vote for Labour in an election tomorrow, compared with 71 per cent who supported Labour in the 2019 election. Given the appalling state of affairs exhibited by Labour since then, five per cent seems optimistic.

Now as the prospect of an election draws closer, we are seeing Labour attempt to change message. Earlier this week, Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting said on LBC that we do, in fact, have a ""responsibility"" to ""recognise a Palestinian state"". I do wonder if this change of tack has anything to do with the fact that Streeting's constituency has just elected a pro-Palestinian activist to run against him in the next election.

Muslim voters have long been underestimated by a political class that views us as too passive, minimal or fickle to make a real difference. I'm not naive enough to think that Labour has suddenly decided to care about what Muslims think. Indeed, the sheer fact that they seem to believe that only their Muslim vote will be affected by their stance on Gaza (as though only Muslims care about what is happening) is testament to how little they understand the mood of the general public.

But Labour has overlooked Muslim voters at its own peril. We are geographically significant as well as politically so. Muslim majority areas happen to constitute many of the same red seats that Labour is desperate to cling on to.

What we are seeing is the desperate final flailing of a party no longer fit for purpose, an opposition that offers no opposition to the status quo. Every Muslim I know is planning to either spoil their ballot in the next election or abstain from voting altogether because a vote for Labour is now equivalent to a stain on our morality. I can't envisage a day where I'd voting Labour again, and I'm certainly not alone.","Labour is in a panic as polling reveals that it is losing support among its most loyal base.

2024-02-01,The inside story of football's cocaine problem,"Cocaine is now widely used at football stadiums - and other drugs such as ketamine are emerging too. Is it worsening fans' behaviour or are they once again being blamed for society's ills?

The days when cocaine was considered a drug of the elites now seem hopelessly out of date. Gone is the time when the archetypes of coke users were stockbrokers, supermodels and game show hosts, as the drug has now become an everyman staple.

You'll find it everywhere, from satellite town nightclubs to corporate events, family barbecues to Ford Transit glove departments, teenage house parties and media soirées.

There are all manner of stats to back this up: Brits are now said to be the world's second-highest users of the drug (remarkably losing the title to Australia, where cocaine commands around $350 (£182) for a gram). There have been traces of coke found in the water supply and tales of people in their nineties being admitted to hospitals with drug-related health problems. It is, quite simply, part of the British experience.

So it's only natural that football, as Britain's most-watched and most-played sport, would catch some of this blowback. Cocaine has long been a part of British football culture.

In his seminal look at football violence, Among the Thugs, American writer Bill Buford tells a story where Manchester United fans stow under the seats of a plane, hiding from the cabin crew, while taking cheeky bumps.

Films such as Football Factory and the array of hooligan pulp biographies are littered with references to the stuff, while terrace chants like ""Jamie Vardy's having a party, bring your rizla, bring your Charlie"" have become totally normalised in fan culture.

Even lowly AFC Wimbledon are known for their cry of ""We drink champagne, we snort cocaine, we've got ladies over here."" Alcohol has been banned in football stands since 1985, when the Thatcher government passed the Sporting Events Act to clamp down on hooliganism; cocaine appears to have emerged as an alternative stimulant.

Recently, however, things have hit a fever pitch. In the 2022-23 season, around 200 people were arrested for possession of cocaine ""in and around"" British football stadiums.

In 2021, a study conducted by the International Journal of Drug Policy found that around 30 percent of people polled had seen coke-taking at football stadiums (but only 1 percent admitted to taking it themselves). The matter even made it before a parliamentary panel, with Peter Houghton from the Football Safety Officers Association telling MPs that the toilets at one Cambridge United game ""looked like a launderette - there was that much powder everywhere"".

In response, the measures and punishments have become more severe. Supporters caught with Class A drugs now face banning orders similar to ones issued for violence or racism and, last year, Charlton Athletic fan Tony Bordley, 52, became the first fan to receive such an order. As well as being banned from attending matches, Bordley cannot travel within two miles of Charlton's ground on match day and must surrender his passport when England play away.

It's a culture I've witnessed first-hand. At the gates of Stamford Bridge, the ground where my team plays, trained sniffer dogs are now part of the set-up, while middle-aged men in Barbour International jackets jokingly push their mates into the dog's path.

I haven't seen cocaine-taking on the terraces themselves, but I have seen plenty of animated, red-faced conversations and suspicious toilet etiquette at the stadium toilets and nearby pubs.

Speaking to friends and acquaintances, the anecdotes come rolling in. ""Cocaine use at Coventry City is rife,"" says one. ""Home and away, there's a large group who are probably late teens or early 20s, all wearing Stone Island and CP Company goggle jackets. Constantly in and out of the toilet during the game in groups, eyeballs rolling.""

One man who certainly understands how cocaine crept into the national game is Carlton Leach, the author, rave security boss and ex-West Ham hooligan. ""Cocaine really came on the scene after ecstasy, about 1989/90,"" he says.

""Back in the 70s, it was an exclusive drug - something pop stars and people with loads of money did. It was a very high-class drug. So most people just smoked a bit of weed or took LSD then. But in the very late 80s, I started seeing it at football and when I was working the doors and at raves.

""It gives you a lot more confidence; it makes you a lot more brazen and violent. You can tell when people are out of their heads on coke; it stands out a mile. You see it a lot at away games, with the younger generation.""

Coke captured the imagination of the British public for a variety of reasons: firstly, the supply factors. The drug itself has been relatively inflation-proof, while increasing in purity for the most part.

Dealers across the country run slick, efficient operations that can deliver bags anytime, anywhere, making it a highly purchasable, commonplace product. Experts have also cited our heavy drinking culture, along with longer working hours in the UK, precarious employment situations and a generally stressful lifestyle that pushes people towards escapism on the weekend.

Football is a natural arena for all this chemical catharsis, but many believe the game is bearing the brunt of the problems of wider society. (There are increasing calls for the drinking ban in football stands to be lifted, given rugby and cricket fans are allowed to consume alcohol in their seats).

Dr Martha Newson, an anthropologist and psychologist at the Universities of Greenwich and Oxford, conducted the study into cocaine at football grounds published by the International Journal of Drug Policy. She says the trend is a reflection of a wider pattern in British society. ""It's so easy and historically common to blame football culture when there's something bigger going on.""

She adds that it's not just cocaine being used in football stadiums. ""Some people have mentioned that ketamine is being used more, which isn't a drug I'd associate with football at all. There's something about the culture of the carnival - people looking to escape from reality. It's about having a shared experience with your buddies in an altered state. It's very communal.""

Dr Newson is also keen to point out that her study, which took her from lower league English matches to Brazilian World Cup games, found very few instances of actual violence but plenty of tribal bonding and increased stress hormone levels.

Her research shows that higher cortisol levels are found when fans feel particularly bonded to their clubs, which creates the emotional cauldron such as the one seen at West Brom vs Wolves last weekend. However, she is keen to point out that not all football fans are there for the violent carnival.

""You have to remember that there are huge swathes of family supporters and the over-60s,"" she continues. ""These are people who come for community activity, not hedonism. A lot of football can be quite mundane, with a lot of queuing and gossiping about players. The drugs are definitely taken by a minority.""

There is no doubt cocaine and football are intrinsically linked. Indeed, they share certain similarities; they produce adrenaline, they bring you closer, they push you to total ecstasy and the brink of misery. Yet making an example out of football fans is a societal bad habit that goes back decades, to the days of Thatcher's football ""war cabinet"" and the electric fence at Stamford Bridge.

""You can't pin it on one type of person,"" says Mr Leach. ""Get crowds of people together - horse racing, music festivals, Formula 1 - you think they're not going to do drugs? Just look at the trouble at Aintree; go to your local pub; there's geezers on coke fighting every weekend. When football fans do it, it's blown out of proportion.""

Football fans thrive on their outsider status: isolating them further because of cocaine may only cause more trouble.","Cocaine is now widely used at football stadiums - and other drugs such as ketamine are emerging too.

Sure, the West Coast psych-rock troupe were beloved by vinyl lovers and bowl-cut enthusiasts in the 1990s, but their attempts to break into the mainstream had been repeatedly thwarted - usually through self-sabotage by their frontman Anton Newcombe - leaving their stoner anthems languishing in obscurity by the dawn of the new millennium.

Then came Dig!. The cult documentary catapulted the band to notoriety all over the world in 2004. This carnival of spurned opportunities, heroin habits and on-stage fist-fights - otherwise depicting the band's rivalry with major label frenemies The Dandy Warhols across the late 1990s - won them legions of new fans fascinated by now-infamous Newcombe. Depicted as a larger-than-life figure with a prolific, unrefined songwriting talent, determined to subvert the booming music industry and ""destroy this fucked-up system"", Newcombe had ambitions that were repeatedly undermined by his own tendency towards self-destruction. There were arrests, disbandments, and broken sitars, leaving viewers to wonder what happened to the flawed genius after the credits rolled.

Today, 20 years since Dig! was awarded the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance Film Festival, the band's music has successfully pilfered all corners of pop culture. Amid vinyl re-issues, new album releases, and countless international tours, ""Straight Up and Down"" was chosen as the title theme to HBO smash hit Boardwalk Empire in 2010 - while opiated calling card ""Anemone"" became perhaps their biggest hit with 70 million streams on Spotify.

Until last year, everything seemed to finally be going well. A newly restored and extended Dig! XX - featuring new narration from band member Joel Gion - was set to premiere at Sundance, and The BJM were embarking on an international tour. Then things came crashing down again. In November 2023, partway through a show in Melbourne, Newcombe grabbed guitarist Ryan Van Kriedt's instrument and hit him over the head with it. They ended up on the floor, punching each other, before security pulled them apart. The brawl made international headlines. Remaining tour dates were abruptly cancelled.

It wasn't always like this, insists Gion, the band's tambourine-playing talisman, whose long-awaited memoir In the Jingle Jangle Jungle arrives off the back of all this noise. In the early days, ""I was so completely enamoured with Anton,"" he tells me. Gion joined the band in the mid-1990s after failing his audition to be a guitarist, and quickly became a calming influence within The BJM's ever-swirling tornado. After his fun-loving antics in Dig! earned him a central spot on the movie release poster, he became a kind of psych-rock pin-up.

Back then, Gion continues, Newcombe was less the ""super outspoken"" man of today's reputation, and more simply a funny and interesting human being. ""He was just this rock of Gibraltar who inspired so much curiosity,"" he says. ""The 'crazy guy' version didn't surface on my radar until the Viper Room show.""

Gion is referring to the 1996 LA industry showcase that would later become the viral calling card for Dig!; ""the embarrassing party video that for all involved will never go away"", as he calls it in Dig! XX. The band were hoping to land a record deal that night as A&Rs assembled en masse. Instead, the show descended into chaos as a ruckus broke out between Newcombe and his bandmates, resulting in instruments being smashed and the group being evicted from the venue. ""A few hours before, we'd been in the backyard singing 'I Am Love',"" Gion rues. ""And then suddenly I just had no idea what was going on. Like, why is my hero behaving this way?""

Still, Gion stuck by Newcombe, and remains the second-longest serving member after the bandleader himself. In 2019, he was struck by a ""creative lightning bolt"", which led to him committing 2,500 words a week via Patreon in order to share tales previously regaled towards a revolving door of band recruits. ""There was no better buzz,"" he tells me - a bold statement, given the extensive references to LSD, ecstasy and heroin in the ensuing hardback. ""If I wrote some scene that I was really happy with, I was set for the day. I was high.""

In the Jingle Jangle Jungle largely spans the early 1990s to the early 2000s, providing fresh perspective to the fabled events witnessed in Dig! plus a panoply of debauched tales from Gion's personal life. From living under surveillance by the US Drug Enforcement Administration while housed in an acid-tab-printing factory to almost breaking up a young Oasis on their first US tour, to encounters with Joey Ramone, Harmony Korine and Robert Downey Jr, Gion is a fount of vibrant storytelling built on groovy colloquialisms and rampant fourth-wall-breaking.

References to UK shoegazers like Ride and The Verve, house parties soundtracked by Blur and Pulp, and the sneaking of contraband to The Jesus and Mary Chain and Primal Scream, meanwhile, provide welcome trail posts for Brits with a lesser grasp of that decade's thriving West Coast music scenes.

But it's Gion's passion and excitement for his own band - and for the man he describes on the page as his ""most tolerant and patient friend"" - that provides the most endearing moments of his book. And yet, there is a conspicuous absence of a promised ""foreword by Anton Newcombe"" in my review copy.

""I was worried about going back in time and dredging all the bad behaviour back into the public eye,"" Gion says. ""But then Melbourne happened.""

The culmination of a too-long stint of touring in 2023, Melbourne was the latest bizarre incident to add to the band's long list of mishaps - with a chorus of boos and the unceremonious lowering of curtains directly mirroring the events at the Viper Room in 1996. Sans the Benny Hill routine and wrestling match, this was the prevalent vibe throughout the entire tour and the rehearsals, says Gion: ""It was almost four months in this bizarre state.

""We'd be hanging out all day, and the vibes would be good,"" he says, re-living the long haul across the US and Australia. ""But then the minute we got on stage, the curtain goes up and the vibes go down. By the fourth song, people are screaming their heads off. I could steal moments - we would do 'That Girl Suicide' and I could just fall into that swimming pool of positive energy. But in the end, I left the stage in a pissed-off huff on all but two or three shows of the entire tour.""

He wasn't the only one. Reddit forums were rife with reports of Newcombe chastising new drummer Dan Lyons (formerly of UK reprobates Fat White Family) through the mic, leading one fan to refer to the tour as a ""psychedelic Jerry Springer show"".

For Gion, percussion-breaking point came on 4 October in Seattle - on a night that resulted in a venue ban for the band. He laughs, remembering the mud slung at him that night: ""Joel wrote a book. I'm not gonna read it,"" Newcombe had told the audience. ""It's really commendable 'cause they could have just had AI do it.""

In response, Gion ""broke a maraca, slammed it on the ground in front of his feet... and just walked,"" he recalls now.

He would be coaxed back, only to abandon ship for good mid-November due to a personal matter at home. Three shows later, Melbourne cemented the tour's fate. ""Everything's kind of weird now,"" Gion admits - he hasn't spoken to Newcombe since. ""I know he's annoyed that Dig!'s coming out again. He's annoyed that I'm narrating it. And he's going to be annoyed when he reads this. But I have to tell the truth. You can't be a memoir writer and not tell your life in a truthful way.""

Chaos has always been the form and function of The BJM -- but incidents like this will never stop Newcombe. ""It's Anton. If you put the fire under him and give him something to fight against, that's when his A-game comes out hard,"" Gion says. ""He's probably going to put out the best record of his career now.""

As for his own involvement: ""If he came up to me in four months and said, 'Man, I've just had this super guru experience and... do you wanna go on tour and play music with me?' I would be out the door that instant. But it's gonna take some huge revelation on his part... And if this is when it's supposed to end, then I'm not going to cling to it. Nothing lasts for ever.""","The Brian Jonestown Massacre's Joel Gion is the second-longest serving member of The BJM.

2024-02-01,Patients denied latest Covid vaccine after having booster jab earlier in rollout,"Clinically vulnerable patients such as David Brown have voiced concerns at being denied a newer XBB vaccine despite it being more effective against the JN.1 strain

Clinically vulnerable people have voiced concerns after being turned down for an additional Covid booster despite studies showing a new jab is more effective against the dominant JN.1 strain.

People who have serious health conditions or are immunosuppressed and remain at higher risk from infections such as Covid say they were turned down for the latest generation of Covid vaccine, having a received a booster jab earlier in the rollout.

Many vulnerable people vaccinated in the autumn during the Covid booster programme were given the older generation BA.4/BA.5 bivalent vaccines.

But studies are now showing these bivalent vaccines are not as effective against the dominant JN.1 strain as the newer XBB vaccines, which was approved for use in the UK in September.

The vaccination programme ended on 31 January, meaning patients will have to wait until autumn 2024 to receive another booster.

Elisabeth Brown, 64, and her husband David, 75, who has chronic lymphatic leukaemia, were vaccinated in late September with the bivalent jab - which was David's eighth Covid vaccine.

Elisabeth, from Norwich, told that since discovering the XBB vaccines are more effective against the dominant Covid variant, they went to their vaccination hub to ask for the jab, but were refused it.

Elisabeth said: ""As the NHS states there only has to be 90 days between vaccinations, we were hoping we could now get the new one. But when we went to our vaccination hub, they flatly turned us down.""

She added: ""It doesn't make sense for the sake of giving a vaccine. David's blood cancer puts him in the cohort at greater risk should he get Covid.

""If he ends up getting Covid, he is at far greater risk of ending up in hospital and costing the NHS a lot of money.""

Lara Wong, spokesperson for the Clinically Vulnerable Families support group, said: ""Elisabeth and many others in our group or in contact with us tell us that they received the old bivalents and are now worried as most of them are unable to be revaccinated until autumn this year.

""These individuals, including many who are clinically extremely vulnerable, are being denied access to the newer, more effective XBB vaccine that is currently sitting in fridges across the country.

""This not only puts them at greater risk of contracting more severe symptoms of Covid-19 but also contributes to their anxiety and uncertainty about their safety.""

A recent preprint US study looking at adults who had received older versions of bivalent Covid-19 vaccines, offered little additional protection against the JN.1 variant.

The Lancet also published a recent paper showing how the JN.1 variant displayed ""significantly enhanced immune escape"" compared with previous strains among vaccinated patients.

Professor Stephen Griffin, a leading virologist, toldthat one problem is that Covid vaccines are being treated in the same way as flu - flu is more predictable and usually happens once a year, whereas with Covid, this is not the case.

""With flu, you can see the strains that are coming and predict what is coming and we're ahead of the game with that,"" he said.

""The BA.5 bivalent vaccine is from the summer of 2022, which means the virus has moved on to several different iterations and the most recent iteration is left-field and very different.

""The lucky thing is that because of the way the virus has evolved, the newer XBB vaccines do still give some protection in terms of neutralising antibody response, the thing that prevents people getting infected and it will almost certainly help individuals in dealing with an infection if they get one.

""The problem is when you compare that to the bivalent driven response, those antibodies are unfortunately nowhere near as good at preventing the newer strains of Covid.

""The simple fact is we are seeing four or five different strains every year because the virus is still changing at an unprecedented rate and is evolving four or five times quicker than influenza.""

He added: ""With Covid, we are always behind the times. Even with XBBs, we are behind as the first XBBs are from some time last year.""

Professor Griffin says he is baffled as to why clinically vulnerable people are being refused the XBB vaccine and told it seems very unfair when their lives are the most constrained by Covid. He says several studies have shown the bivalent vaccines are not as effective against the currently circulating viruses.

""There is a reasoning that says if you have a vaccine, you are better protected against the most severe types of Covid,"" he says. ""But we have to remember that clinically vulnerable people are those in the population who don't make the best response to vaccines in the first place.

""So to give them a sub optimal vaccine to my mind is not a particularly good idea. I really don't understand why clinically vulnerable people are being refused the XBB vaccine. It strikes me as very odd.

""I believe they are keeping some XBB stocks back for the next vaccination programme - but all that will do is set us back to where we were with the BA.5s because they will be out-of-date.""

A UK Health Security Agency spokesperson said: ""For the autumn 2023 vaccination programme, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advised that individuals at highest risk should be offered the latest Covid-19 variant vaccines that had received UK regulatory approval by MHRA and were available for use.

""All of the vaccines advised for the 2023 autumn vaccination programme were expected to be effective at preventing serious illness and hospitalisation from Covid-19, and initial data published by UKHSA shows that both the BA.4-5 and XBB vaccines were effective in reducing hospitalisation in the over-65 ages group.

""Those eligible were advised to take up a vaccine dose as early as possible to protect against the new variant that was increasing in circulation at that time, irrespective of which vaccine was offered.""","Clinically vulnerable people have voiced concerns after being turned down for an additional Covid booster.

2024-02-01,The parents doing DIY dentistry on their own children,"Across the country there are now hospital wards full of young children having their teeth removed. Extraction of decaying teeth is the leading cause of hospital admissions for children aged six to 10 in England, and one paediatric dentist tellsthat she has had to pull out all 20 baby teeth from the mouths of children as young as two years old.

Elsewhere, parents are resorting to DIY dentistry, undertaking fixes at home - with their untrained eyes - using items bought online including teeth-filling products to attempt to fill their children's teeth, says Professor Claire Stevens, a spokesperson for the British Society of Paediatric Dentistry (BSPD), or gels to relieve toothache, which can burn the child's gums. ""Of course [filling] can cause more harm than good as often the tooth requires extraction, not filling. DIY dentistry is of course not advised,"" she says.

And if parents aren't yet doing this, many are relying on charities coming into their children's school for help because they can't access NHS dental care or afford private treatment.

Too often, says Stevens, children's oral health is totally overlooked - perhaps because there is a sense they will lose those teeth later anyway - but the implications can be huge. ""While a child has toothache, they may not be eating or sleeping, so we're seeing children failing to thrive. They're falling below their predicted rate of growth, they're living with chronic pain, and that affects their concentration, which impacts school readiness,"" she says. NHS data shows 60,000 school days a year are missed due to children in hospital for tooth extraction.

In the worst-case scenarios, poor oral health in children can lead to infection, facial swelling, or even sepsis. And then there are the social implications: being seen as the dirty child, the poor child, which brings its own long-term psychological effects. ""It's just not acceptable that this is happening in a modern society. It's Victorian and heartbreaking to see,"" she says.

But how did we get here? In theory, all children are entitled to free NHS dental care.

We only have to look at the wider crisis in dentistry, where patients of all ages are struggling to access care. In 2023, the British Dental Association (BDA) reported that half of dentists had cut their commitment to providing NHS treatment, with more planning to follow, because of objections to the current NHS contract. An investigation by the BBC found that 90 per cent of dental practices across the UK were no longer accepting new adult NHS patients, and 80 per cent were not taking on children. The BBC also found that one in 10 local authorities did not have a single practice accepting under-16s for NHS treatment.

""It's a multifactorial issue, which has been on our radar for over a decade,"" Professor Stevens says. ""Covid certainly exacerbated the problem, but our concerns about children's oral health predate the pandemic by many years.""

Alex, from Norfolk, was completely unable to get an NHS dentist appointment for his sons, two and four, despite trying since his eldest's first teeth came through. ""They had their first appointment six months ago, privately, as we'd run out of other options. Luckily, they're fine, but we obviously did worry that we might be neglecting something in that time,"" he says. ""We paid £25 per child for someone literally just to have a look in their mouths.""

In Gloucestershire, Jessica faced similar issues after her dental practice announced they would no longer be offering NHS treatment. ""I approached 10 different practices and couldn't find any near me that were offering NHS dentistry,"" she says. Her family eventually paid £39 each for her two children, eight and 11, to be seen privately - but says they now go less frequently as a result.

""They used to go religiously, every six months; we were really conscientious. It was a non-negotiable for me because I had a lot of problems with my teeth when I was little, but there's really no incentive to take them every six months now. It's such a shame and there must be a lot of people who [can't afford] to take their children at all,"" she adds.

Indeed, Professor Stevens says, oral health inequalities are widening. Figures show children in the most deprived areas of the country are almost three times as likely to have experience of tooth decay (35.1 per cent) as those living in the least deprived areas (13.5 per cent).

But access to NHS dental care is only one part of the problem. ""I'd love to see every child having access to an NHS dentist, but that alone doesn't solve it,"" Professor Stevens says, pointing to the cost of living crisis and wider social determinants of health. ""Unfortunately, the children who are most unable to access dental care are typically the same children who don't have access to as many fresh fruit and vegetables; who eat more processed foods; whose families are living on or below the poverty line. Those children get the raw deal each time.""

Professor Stevens says to solve this ""we really need a plan targeted at those who need it most, to start reducing health inequalities across the board."" The Labour Party this month announced proposals, including supervised toothbrushing in schools - a policy welcomed by the BSPD.

One group uniquely placed to support more holistically is school nurses, says Sallyann Sutton, Professional Officer at the School and Public Health Nurses Association (SAPHNA). ""Historically school nurses have been working with schools and parents to promote dental hygiene from an early age, to look at nutrition and other factors, and to take a whole system approach to preventing these issues,"" she says. ""We are qualified NHS nurses with master's level education in public health, so this is exactly where our expertise lies. But sadly, we've lost around 30 per cent of our capacity in recent years because of cuts of the public health grant.""

Labour's proposal is to introduce a national programme of targeted, supervised toothbrushing for three-to-five-year-olds in free primary school breakfast clubs. Similar schemes are already widely used in Scotland, and in some parts of England, and data shows they pay for themselves within three years, with a five-year return on investment of £3.06 for every £1 spent. But school leaders say a much clearer plan is needed to deliver it nationwide.

""Primary schools clearly do not have the staff, time or funding at present which would be necessary to do this. We do not think this can be a task assigned to teachers, as their job is to teach children, and it would in fact require specific staffing and training for this purpose, as well as ensuring there are suitable spaces and facilities in schools that are often very small,"" says Geoff Barton, General Secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL).

One area already taking a multi-layered approach is Doncaster, where children's oral health is amongst the worst in the country. Over a third (37.2 per cent) of children in the city have experience of tooth decay, compared with the national average of 23.4 per cent, with each child having around four teeth affected. Since 2016, Doncaster children's public health team has been working alongside school nurses to support toothbrushing clubs, education for both children and their parents, and referrals for particularly vulnerable children.

""We've got children who don't even have a toothbrush or toothpaste, or who may use their finger instead of a toothbrush,"" says Jayne Ashby, a Specialist Community Public Health Nurse and team lead for the Doncaster Children and Young People's Health and Well-being Service. ""There's a huge void of good education for parents around effective brushing, and dental pain is one of the biggest causes of poor school attendance. We're doing work in schools to provide parents with that education, and we also link with a local charity to provide toothpaste, toothbrushes and distribute those in schools to the most vulnerable children,"" she says.

School nurses in Doncaster also help with training for school toothbrushing clubs. ""The toothbrushing itself takes around 15 minutes at the start of the school day, and is supervised by the teacher. It doesn't sound like a long time in the grand scheme of things, but we do appreciate it's a commitment for schools and can be a barrier to signing up,"" Ashby explains.

""But the issue is about more than just cleaning teeth,"" she adds. ""It's about access to free school meals and good, affordable, healthy food. It's about educating parents, improving access to dentists, and promoting healthy decisions and choices throughout children's lives.""","Across the country there are now hospital wards full of young children having their teeth removed.

2024-02-01,The Devon beach where a mouthful of sewage while swimming can make you sick,"A woman is taking South West Water to court over sewage pollution at a beach where dozens of incidents of illness have been reported

People have reported getting sick nearly 30 times after visiting the beach at the heart of a legal battle between a wild swimmer and her water company.

Gastroenteritis was the most common illness reported last year by those taking a dip at the popular Devon seaside resort of Exmouth.

Others reported ear, nose and throat infections, according to the Surfers Against Sewage campaign group, which collects the data.

It comes as Jo Bateman submitted an action to the Small Claims Court, alleging the dumping of sewage into the sea at Exmouth has affected her physical and mental wellbeing.

South West Water is permitted to discharge waste into the sea during times of exceptional rainfall to prevent its system from becoming overwhelmed.

But locals are concerned about the frequency with which this is happening. Ms Bateman claims to have identified 54 instances where she believes South West Water illegally dumped sewage into the sea last year.

As part of her case, she will argue that the sewage discharges have prevented her from taking daily swims, something she says helps manage her depression.

Surfers Against Sewage operates an app that alerts users to when there is sewage pollution at their local beach and asks swimmers to report information, including when they have experienced illness after swimming in the sea.

There have been 65 reports of people falling sick after visiting Exmouth Beach since 2020, including 28 reports last year.

Of these 28, 23 reports related to gastroenteritis, while others reported infections and viral illnesses.

Surfers Against Sewage said 17 (74 per cent) of these incidents were reported when there was a confirmed sewage alert in place at Exmouth.

In January, revealed that millions of litres of sewage had been transported to what the Environment Agency called a ""failed pumping station"" just 200m from Exmouth's sandy beach.

Multiple dog owners reported their pets becoming seriously ill after playing at the beach while this incident took place.

Some were forced to pay thousands on vet bills after their dogs required emergency care.

Meanwhile, swimmers told they had been forced to avoid the beach due to the pollution incident.

South West Water said it cannot comment on the potential causes of sickness of individuals without knowing the exact date, time and location when people were in the water.

The bathing water quality at Exmouth has previously been rated as excellent by the Environment Agency, but the water is not tested all year round.","Gastroenteritis was the most common illness reported at Exmouth beach last year.

2024-02-01,Alan Bates says he will reject government's 'cruel' compensation offer,"The lead campaigner for justice in the Post Office scandal said the offer was around a sixth of what he requested

Alan Bates, the former subpostmaster who has led the campaign for justice in the Post Office Horizon scandal has said he will reject an offer of compensation from the government which he branded ""offensive"" and ""cruel"".

The government confirmed plans for ""full and fair compensation"" to subpostmasters affected by the IT scandal in 2022.

But Mr Bates told the Daily Telegraph the compensation offer had been ""around a sixth"" of what he requested.

""'Full and fair' might be His Majesty's Government's interpretation, but in reality the offer is derisory, offensive and after all this time, yes, cruel,"" he told the paper.

""I will absolutely be turning this offer for financial redress down.

""It's just a terrible way to treat human beings - and I have heard from several subpostmasters who have received similarly derisory offers, while others are still waiting.""

The former sub-postmaster, whose two-decade fight inspired the ITV series Mr Bates vs The Post Office, said the offer had been made on Wednesday, 111 days after his claim had been submitted.

""I have been in the queue along with all the others in the scheme, but if my case is an example of the way they are going to treat all cases, we may as well start looking at a legal action again and let the judiciary decide.""

2024-02-01,"The King and I is dated, but Helen George charms at the Dominion Theatre","Undercurrents of Orientalism, white saviours, and emotionally compliant women all taint this classic Rodgers and Hammerstein - but the songs are still glorious

When an actor becomes overwhelmingly associated with one role, it can be hard to envisage them taking on any other part. Helen George has played Nurse Trixie Franklin in all 12 series of the BBC's unstoppable hit Sunday night drama Call the Midwife, but what is far less known is that George studied at the Royal Academy of Music. A tantalising glimpse of her vocal talent was in evidence at the VE Day 75 anniversary concert at Buckingham Palace in 2020.

It is not too fanciful a stretch of the imagination to conjecture that had Trixie been alive in 1862, she might have done something similar to The King and I's widow Anna Leonowens - the ""I"" of the title - and gone to Siam as schoolteacher to the King's many children and wives. Both Trixie and Anna are resilient, pragmatic and posh and possibly, anachronistically, strongly feminist. What is clear from the musical's opening number is that George has a most pleasant voice and can certainly hold a tune. In her huge billowing Victorian hooped skirts, she looks as though she might set sail at any moment.

Rodgers and Hammerstein's 1951 hit, a key work from the ""golden age"" of American musical theatre, is a piece that appears increasingly problematic, with its undercurrents of Orientalism and white saviours. A merciful amount of laughing at foreigners' funny English has been excised from the script now, making it considerably, if not entirely, more palatable to modern sensibilities. Less in keeping with the fast pace of theatre nowadays is Bartlett Sher's production, first seen on Broadway in 2015, which never deviates from a bearing of 'stately, if slow'. At three hours, this is a long evening, which at times we wish would gather a little more momentum on the Dominion's dauntingly wide stage (cue rather too much static front-stage declaiming).

The King and I was the first musical with which I fell in love, at the age of 15, and it transpires that I still know all the words to all the songs, even though I haven't listened to the soundtrack in many years. What glorious songs they are: ""I Whistle a Happy Tune"", ""Hello, Young Lovers"" and best of all, ""Shall We Dance?"" This last is sung near the end by Anna and the King (Darren Lee, appealing), whose feisty relationship has fizzed and crackled throughout, with his modernising instincts crashing up against his polygamy and decidedly less enlightened attitude towards women.

Such an idiosyncratic figure is the independent and educated Anna in this society that she is addressed, initially at least, as ""sir"". George and Lee lead us confidently through the stages of this abrasive pair's blooming friendship, even though I struggle slightly now to locate the emotional charge that so spoke to my teenage self.

The adult me cannot help but bristle at the stealthily pervasive idea of a stubborn man requiring all the women in his orbit to be emotionally compliant.","Helen George has played Nurse Trixie Franklin in all 12 series of BBC's Call the Midwife.

2024-02-01,"40,000 XL bullies beat ban as police tell public to call 101 for unmuzzled dogs","People are encouraged to report owners seen breaching the ban by calling 101, with an estimated 10,000 dogs believed to have missed out on exemption certificates

Around 40,000 XL bully dogs have beaten the ban which comes into force across England and Wales today, aimed at clamping down on the dangerous breed involved in a string of fatal attacks.

From 1 February, anyone found in possession of an American XL bully could face criminal proceedings and an unlimited fine unless their animal is registered as exempt.

Police have powers to seize and impound unregistered dogs, which could be put down if the owner fails to subsequently obtain an exemption through the courts.

The National Police Chiefs Council revealed that around 40,000 dogs had been granted exemptions by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra), allowing them to remain in the community.

As the ban came into force, the NPCC urged members of the public to report dogs being kept in breach of the law to 101.

Neighbourhood officers have also been urged to look out for XL bully owners walking the dogs without a lead or a muzzle, given the immediate risk to public safety.

NPCC Dangerous Dogs Lead Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hobrough said: ""There's an obligation on everybody within society to stop a serious or fatal dog attack happening within their own community.

""We are encouraging people to pick up the phone if they have any concerns about a dog.""

The large bulldog-type breed was added to the list of dangerous dogs after being linked to a dramatic increase in fatal attacks over recent years.

There have been 23 deaths related to dog attacks since the start of 2021, compared with an average of three fatalities per year from 2001 to 2021.

The XL bully breed has been ""disproportionately involved"" in this rise, according to the Government, which announced the ban in September soon after the death of a man who was attacked by two dogs - suspected to be XL bullies - in Staffordshire.

Since 31 December, it has been illegal to breed, sell or abandon XL bullies. Owners were also already required to muzzle them and keep them on a lead in public.

Owners were given until noon on Wednesday to obtain an exemption certificate online. The application process required them to pay a £92.40 fee, purchase active public liability insurance, arrange for the animal to be neutered and ensure it was microchipped.

Owners who chose to have their dogs euthanised instead were offered £200 towards the cost of the procedure.

According to Defra figures, there have been 117 compensation claims so far.

On Wednesday, Scotland confirmed that it would be introducing its own ban on 23 February.

There are no official figures on the number of XL bullies in the UK, but Peter Madden, dangerous dog advisor for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire police, referred to an estimate by one of the UK's largest veterinary chains that the population could be at least 50,000.

David Martin, group animal welfare adviser for IVC Evidensia told MPs in September that there were at least 5,000 XL bully dogs registered at the company's practices, which accounts for around 10 per cent of UK vets.

On this basis, he estimated that the total XL bully population is at least 50,000.

Some experts, however, believe there could be more than 100,000 of the dogs in the UK - with a particular concentration in the North of England.

Given these numbers, concerns have been raised about whether police would be able to find sufficient kennel space to impound XL bullies, following reports that forces were already struggling before the ban.

Chief Inspector Patrick O'Hara said that areas facing capacity issues may have to work with other forces to utilise kennel spaces elsewhere.

He said: ""Kennelling is a challenging industry - it's not just exclusive to police kennelling.

""Since Covid, a number of kennels have shut down, a number of developers have bought the land up - the capacity of the industry is not quite what it once was.

""Our kennelling network is all sub-contracted out to industry. There are very few, if any, police forces that use their own internal police dog training centres for kennelling capacity.

""So, we are we are to some degree at the behest of industry in that regard. But policing is a flexible and an enabling organisation and we will flex and enable accordingly.""

Mr O'Hara stressed that police would only make use of special measures, known as the Interim Exemption Scheme (IES), to free up kennel spaces where appropriate.

The IES allows forces to return suspected prohibited dogs to their home address pending their court date if a chief police officer is satisfied the animal is not a threat the public and that the owner is responsible.

""If all of those things are lining up, then the dog might be released pending a court proceeding,"" he said. ""It's not the police issuing some sort of a pass.""

In the run-up to the ban, concerns were also raised about a shortage of specialist officers needed to identify banned breeds, known as Dog Legislation Officers (DLOs).

Mr O'Hara said that there are now 137 DLOs across the UK, at least one for every force, except the City of London, which has an arrangement with the Met.

The NPCC, which delivers training, is looking to increase capacity over the next six months, adding another 60 by September.

From early next week, Defra data on exemptions will be shared with local police forces, so they are aware of where registered XL bullies are located.

Where forces receive reports of law breaches, their response will be ""proportionate, with a minimum use of force,"" Mr Hobrough said.

Officers will initially attend an address to verify whether a breed is of a suspected banned type.

If there are concerns, they will return to execute a warrant for the dog's seizure.

Mr Madden said there was no evidence that there would be additional resistance to the enforcement of XL bully ban compared with previous breeds.

""On most occasions, the dog will simply be walked out on a leash by the owner when we're seizing them,"" he said. ""One of the advantages of going round with a warrant is that we are not attending to have a discussion about seizing the dog, we are seizing the dog.

""We want to do that with the of fuss and stress and the maximum of safety to everybody involved. We have a big range of tactical options that we can get into, but we will always start with the least amount of force appropriate to the circumstances.""","Around 40,000 XL bully dogs have beaten the ban which comes into force today.

2024-02-01,Injection to treat aggressive blood cancer launches on NHS,"UK drug watchdog green-lights use of Tepkinly, also known as epcoritamab, for DLBCL lymphoma

Hundreds of patients with an aggressive form of blood cancer will soon get access to a new type of drug on the NHS.

The UK's drug watchdog has authorised the use of Tepkinly, also known as epcoritamab, as a treatment for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). It will be available for people in England and Wales whose cancer has returned or has not responded to at least two previous treatments.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommendation is based on trial data that showed there was no evidence of disease from tests and scans in almost four in 10 hard-to-treat patients, who on average had already been through three types of treatment before starting the trial.

""Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a type of blood cancer and, while most people go into remission after standard treatment, some people can see their cancer return,"" said Rincy George, policy officer at Blood Cancer UK.

""Like many that experience blood cancer, people with relapsed or refractory DLBCL experience anxiety around the prospect of not responding to treatment or the cancer once again returning.""

DLBCL is an aggressive blood cancer, with nearly 5,500 new diagnoses in the UK each year. For around 700 of these patients whose cancer has returned or has not responded to at least two prior treatments, prognosis is poor with so few treatments available.

Epcoritamab is part of a new class of therapies called bispecific antibodies, which help the body's immune system to attack and destroy cancerous cells, giving those patients fresh hope of living longer.

Epcoritamab is designed to simultaneously attach to two different cells, one immune T cell and one cancerous lymphoma cell, bringing them together, so the immune T cell is activated to destroy the cancerous lymphoma cell.

It is injected under the skin at hospital weekly for 12 weeks, then every other week for 24 weeks before continuing as one injection every four weeks until treatment is discontinued, either due to cancer progression or side effects.

Mr George said: ""Epcoritamab, is an injectable bispecific antibody designed to recognise and attach to the cancer cells and immune cells, so that the body's immune system can destroy them. Today's decision from NICE approving epcoritamab for eligible patients for use on the NHS in England and Wales is a welcome step for many.""

Chris Fox, Professor of Haematology at the University of Nottingham, said: ""Epcoritamab is the first bispecific to be given as a subcutaneous injection which gives patients and clinicians an additional choice of administration option, which may help to support capacity planning within lymphoma services. The decision by NICE will be welcomed by both patients and the clinical community.""

Belinda Byrne, medical director at AbbVie UK, which makes the drug, said: ""We will continue working closely with the relevant authorities to provide equitable access across the UK for eligible DLBCL patients in need.""","UK drug watchdog green-lights use of Tepkinly, also known as epcoritamab, for DLBCL lymphoma.

2024-01-31,Woman and children injured in corrosive substance attack in London,"Three other members of the public were also injured while trying to come to their aid during the incident near Clapham Common.

A woman and her two young children have been taken to hospital after a man threw a suspected corrosive substance at them in south London, police have said.

A man was seen fleeing the scene and no arrests have been made.

Three other members of the public were also taken to hospital after the incident in Lessar Avenue near Clapham Common, at around 7.25pm on Wednesday.

Their injuries are thought to have been suffered as they came to the aid of the woman and her children.

2024-01-31,Liverpool dominate sorry Chelsea to swing title race in their favour,"ANFIELD -- Meteorologists scratching their heads looking for the next storm name need look no further.

Storm Jurgen is a ferocious sight. Given extra oomph by last week's announcement that shocked the world, Liverpool really are willing to blow the rest of the competition away in pursuit of the perfect end to the German's breathless spell in England.

A 200th Premier League win for Jurgen Klopp - only Pep Guardiola has reached the mark in fewer games - was brought about by a truly ferocious display that Chelsea, even in their much-improved guise, had no answer to. Few could offer any resistance to the Klopp cyclone.

Darwin Nunez had five shots, two against the woodwork, inside 18 minutes, even before Diogo Jota opened the scoring, with young Conor Bradley's relentless rise keeping the toothy Klopp supergrin set in place all match.

Nunez could even miss a penalty and not burst the Anfield bubble. The Klopp juggernaut's last ride is one for the thrill seekers, for sure.

For a man who insists that the rest of this season is not about him, he sure mentions his imminent departure a lot, with a large portion of his programme notes dedicated to the subject.

But even without the gentle reminders from the man himself, there is going to be no escaping the impending doom north of the Wirral.

Every match has to be played the Klopp way, something to remember him by as, if the manager is going give every last drop of energy to winning Liverpool their second Premier League title, then the least his players can do is follow suit.

The man at the centre of everything was coming from a familiar part of the pitch for a Liverpool tempo dictator, but with Trent Alexander-Arnold watching on, worriedly, from the bench, Bradley showed Chelsea what happens when you give academy graduates their chance to shine.

Firstly, he set up Jota for the Portuguese's fourth goal in as many games, only to create a moment he and his family will never forget, arrowing a superb strike into the net six minutes before the break.

Nunez's woes in front of goal won't go away, however, as he, after being handed the duties by Alexis Mac Allister, arrowed against the only post he hadn't hit yet from the spot on the stroke of half-time.

Chelsea improved marginally after the break, with another struggling forward, Mykhailo Mudryk, missing a golden chance to get his side back into it.

It mattered little, as Liverpool in this mood were always going to score again, Dominik Szoboszlai heading in the third to keep Anfield bristling, from another pinpoint Bradley cross - the Northern Irish youngster's fifth goal contribution in his last two Liverpool appearances.

Christopher Nkunku's neat finish was in vain as Luis Diaz put the icing on the cake late on to keep Liverpool out in front at the Premier League summit.

Manchester City may well do what they always do at this time of year and go on 20-game unbeaten runs in second gear, but Liverpool's title tilt is only going to be played one way.","Jurgen Klopp's 200th Premier League win was brought about by a truly ferocious display.

2024-01-31,Jeremy Hunt admits there is less room for tax cuts in spring Budget,"Jeremy Hunt has said it is unlikely he will have ""the kind of room"" for tax cuts in the spring Budget like he did in the Autumn Statement.

The Chancellor confirmed that he warned the Cabinet there is less scope for tax reductions in his the Budget, despite clamour from within the Tory ranks for cuts to try to woo voters.

Mr Hunt told ITV's Peston on Wednesday evening: ""We go through a process ahead of every budget and Autumn Atatement where you don't actually know the final numbers until a couple of weeks before. And we're still in the middle of that process.

""As things stand at the moment - things can change - it doesn't look like I'll have the kind of room that I had for those very big tax cuts in the autumn.

""And I did mention that to the Cabinet, yes.""

The comments come after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday warned further tax cuts could risk the Government's ability to invest money in the NHS and other vital services.

Mr Hunt cut national insurance in November's Autumn Statement, a move the Office for Budget Responsibility thinks will cost the Treasury around £9.76bn in the 2028 tax year.

In a reduction that came into force on 6 January and is being felt in pay packets this month, the main rate of national insurance was sliced by two percentage points, from 12 per cent to 10 per cent.

The Treasury says the change means a worker on a £35,000 salary will be £450 better off a year, although critics say the benefits are offset by the continuing freeze in personal tax thresholds, pulling millions into paying more into the coffers of the Exchequer.

On a visit in January to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the Chancellor said ""the direction of travel"" is for the UK to emulate successful low-tax economies.

Economists have said the fact the Government borrowed less than expected in December might give the Treasury chief the cover he needs to slash taxes further in the spring Budget.

Yet December's figures from the Office for National Statistics said debt levels are higher than they have been since the 60s when compared with the size of the economy.

Responding to the IMF's briefing on Tuesday, Mr Hunt said it was ""too early to know whether further reductions in tax will be affordable in the Budget"".

He said it continued to be Government thinking that ""smart tax reductions can make a big difference in boosting growth"".

Health minister Dame Andrea Leadsom, asked on LBC whether she wants to see further tax cuts, said it is the Chancellor's ambition to ""enable people to keep more of their hard-earned cash"".

The IMF has downgraded the UK's growth forecast for next year. The body's economists expect UK growth to hit 0.6 per cent this year, and 1.6 per cent next.

It would make the economy the second-worst performer in the G7 this year and the joint third-worst performer in 2025.

The IMF's forecast for this year is unchanged since its last report in October, but has been downgraded by 0.4 percentage points for next year.

But the IMF said that change is largely due to a revision to official data, rather than a worsening economic situation.

Conservative former cabinet minister Sir David Davis told LBC's Andrew Marr that the IMF should ""go get lost"" over its tax warning.

""We should stop listening to financial forecasts that are based on the prejudices of the people who write them,"" he said.

The ex-Brexit secretary also predicted ""there'll be tax cuts, the question is the size"".",Jeremy Hunt warns Cabinet there is less room for tax cuts in the spring Budget.

2024-01-31,Domino Day is not as badass as it thinks it is,"This new drama follows a modern-day witch navigating dating apps - while the idea is promising, the execution feels too familiar

When a television show comes along with a strong ""feminist take"" marketing energy it often fills me with dread. Not because I don't love on-screen explorations of women's issues (I really do) but because sometimes shows pitched this way feel as clunky as the International Women's Day tweets of a company that still hasn't rectified its gender pay gap. You can't just stick women being badasses in a story and assume that says something progressive.

Unfortunately, Domino Day is a show that makes precisely this assumption. The eponymous Domino is a 20-something witch with a vampiric need to suck energy from humans to survive. Since she's also a Nice Person (it's important even for girls who are badasses to be nice, after all) she only does this by finding utter douchebags on dating apps and stealing the life force from people who, frankly, deserve it.

In the first episode, we met Domino (played with an enjoyable mixture of intensity and fragility by the Bafta-nominated Siena Kelly) as she waited for one such pillock at a fancy bar. We knew he was a pillock immediately because he had greased-back hair and when she asked him what he was into he purred back with practised sycophancy, ""You. I'm into you.""

Soon they were back at his expensive but soulless apartment and it looked like there was about to be a sexual assault when Domino turned the tables by literally flipping the greaseball (who had secretly set up an iPad to film the encounter) onto the bed, arching her back and taking everything out of him in a blast of yellow light. Then, she pressed his forehead with her thumb and hissed, with a nifty fusion of witchy language and English so that audiences could understand, that he'd forget everything, washed up their wine glasses, blocked him on the apps and left. So far, so 21 century Buffy the Vampire Slayer, with added sex and noticeably less fun.

The set-up itself wasn't really the problem. A witch on dating apps is an entertaining idea, and so is taking revenge on the terrible men that populate bars and the internet, in the manner of Emerald Fennell's feature film, Promising Young Woman. The show is set in Manchester too, and aesthetically the first episode delivered, with beautiful, trendy young people, milling around beautiful, trendy bars and cafés, doing realistically poorly paid jobs and trying to figure out nascent adulthood.

The problem was the stale way it was put together. Other witches in Manchester (all of them trendy, beautiful young women, naturally) had noticed Domino doing her app thing, and were concerned by it (although it wasn't yet clear why) so they started following her. The douchebag woke up thinking he had the worst hangover of his life until he found the iPad recording and tried to track down his nightmare date with a view to blackmail and general douchery.

There were meetings in dusty, antique-filled storerooms. There was occult writing on mirrors. There was a punchy female rap soundtrack. It all felt too familiar, and the dialogue felt disappointingly hackneyed. ""I don't know what it is but there's something about her,"" proclaimed one of the other witches, helpfully alerting us to Domino's uniqueness, perhaps just in case we hadn't worked out she was the protagonist of the show.

Screenwriter Lauren Sequeira tried to inject some welcome levity - Domino using her witchy powers in her day job as a barista to transform a mean-spirited customer's cappuccino butterfly art into a skull, and experiencing a date with a good guy - but there was nothing really to tell you who Domino was and why we should care.

With any luck the next episodes of the six-parter will give us something that feels a bit more fresh, but for now this felt like a rehash of other mystic dramas with a script that thought it was a bit more badass that it actually was.","""Domino Day"" follows a 20-something witch navigating dating apps.

2024-01-31,Sturgeon loses reputation and SNP votes,"Labour are hoping to take a number of seats from Humza Yousaf's party in this year's general election, after being left with just one in 2019

The SNP's electoral chances are likely to have been dented further by the ongoing controversy engulfing Nicola Sturgeon, polling experts have said.

While the party's popularity had already begun to fall before Ms Sturgeon resigned as leader a year ago, that decline will have been accelerated by the row over SNP finances and the revelations at the Covid inquiry about her handling of the pandemic, they argued.

And Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, said on Wednesday that Ms Sturgeon's evidence, in which she confirmed she had deleted WhatsApp messages at the height of the pandemic, would fuel a ""huge sense of betrayal"" among Scottish voters.

Labour are hoping to take a number of seats from Humza Yousaf's party in this year's general election, after being left with just one in 2019, and Keir Starmer needs a breakthrough in Scotland if he is to become prime minister.

Chris Hopkins, director of polling company Savanta, said: ""The SNP's polling decline actually began long before Sturgeon's resignation as leader, but has accelerated throughout the controversy that has engulfed her ever since.

""What was once a 21-point SNP lead over Labour has completely disintegrated, and the last Savanta poll in Scotland showed the parties neck and neck on 35 per cent apiece. This would undoubtedly result in a heavy loss of seats for the SNP at the next election, and potential relegation to the fourth largest party in the UK Parliament.""

He added: ""It's difficult to say with any certainty how much lower the SNP could drop. In recent history, the party has always been known for having a large core and loyal base, and with no alternative pro-independence party for SNP voters to switch to.

""However, there is some notable movement to Labour, with 18 per cent of 2021 SNP voters saying they'd vote Labour at the next General Election, and Anas Sarwar's party are also pulling in voters from the Conservatives, making them a formidable opponent for the SNP where, electorally, you'd suspect things could get worse before they get better.""

Speaking to reporters in Westminster, Mr Sarwar said the former first minister's evidence was all the more damaging because she had set herself up as a counterpoint to Boris Johnson during the pandemic.

Mr Sarwar added: ""There is such a huge sense of betrayal amongst the Scottish public. Nicola Sturgeon was someone that, regardless of where they sit on the political spectrum, they looked at during the Covid pandemic, particularly in contrast to Boris Johnson, and thought this was someone that was standing up, telling the truth and being straight up with them and trying to navigate the best way through the pandemic.

""And I think there has been such a huge breach of that trust now, and such a sense of betrayal, that is going to rightfully anger so many people across the country.

""The anger with Boris Johnson was the whole, in her own words, he was a clown, he was an idiot, he didn't know what he was doing. No one makes that accusation of Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP. They knew what they were doing.""

Asked whether her evidence had damaged the case for Independence, Mr Sarwar said: ""It's for the Scottish people to decide their own future. I don't support independence, I don't support a referendum and that is our unequivocal position both in Scotland and across the UK.

""But in saying that I can completely understand why there are lots of people in Scotland whose drive towards supporting independence came from the fact that they wanted to run a million miles away from this rotten Tory government and they thought the only escape therefore was supporting the SNP or supporting independence.""

Mr Sarwar claimed Labour can now beat the Conservatives across the UK as well as the SNP in Scotland.

In her evidence to the Covid inquiry, Ms Sturgeon denied she had used the pandemic to further the case for independence.

She told inquiry counsel Jamie Dawson KC: ""If I had at any point decided to politicise a global pandemic that was robbing people of their lives and livelihoods, and educational opportunities, and had decided in the face of that to prioritise campaigning for independence, then, yes, it absolutely would have been as you described. Which is precisely why I didn't do it - I wouldn't have done it.""

Ms Sturgeon told the inquiry it was ""not my style and it's never been my practice"" to use WhatsApp to conduct government business ""because it's not a helpful process in reaching decisions"".

Asked what happened to the WhatsApp messages she sent and received during the pandemic, she said that they were ""not retained"".

Ms Sturgeon argued that on rare occasions government business had been conducted via WhatsApp she had recorded it ""properly through the system"".

Pressed again by Mr Dawson if she had deleted the messages, she said: ""Yes, in the manner I have set out.""

She added that the Scottish Government was ""open, transparent and accountable"" during the pandemic and denied using the pandemic for political gain.","SNP's electoral chances likely dented further by ongoing controversy engulfing Nicola Sturgeon.

2024-01-31,Look closely and there are glimpses of economic hope,"The UK's debt-to-GDP ratio is similar, and in several cases lower, than that of other major developed countries

This is Armchair Economics with Hamish McRae, a subscriber-only newsletter from i. If you'd like to get this direct to your inbox, every single week, you can sign up here.

Tax cuts in the Budget next month? The International Monetary Fund thinks this would be a bad idea, and that has caught the headlines. Jeremy Hunt wants to cut them, but he has apparently warned the Cabinet that there won't be as much room as there was last year, so will lower taxes remain an aspiration rather than a reality?

Well, for a start let's get one thing clear. These aren't real cuts, just as the reduction in national insurance Contributions that has just come in was merely reversing previous increases. The overall tax take as a percentage of the country's GDP will be the highest since the early 50s. Even if taxes are trimmed a bit, they will still be higher than any stage since the early 80s - so higher than most people in jobs now will have experienced in their working lives.

Yet, as the IMF points out, more money is needed for public services and investment in infrastructure. And while the IMF has not covered itself with glory in recent years in its commentary on the UK - its growth forecasts have proved too pessimistic on several occasions - its concerns have been echoed here by the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies. The IFS argues that whoever forms the next government, it will have to face some difficult trade-offs between reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio, maintaining public spending and holding down taxes.

It is a dismal litany, but to put all this in context, the UK's debt-to-GDP ratio is similar, and in several cases lower, than that of other major developed countries. Only Germany has a much lower national debt. Taxation as a share of GDP is lower than the OECD average, though higher than other English-speaking countries such as the US, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland. And relative to the other G7 economies, the UK has performed better than the average since 2000. Even the US, which has grown faster than just about everyone else, faces serious problems, notably a fiscal deficit of more than six per cent of GDP compared with the UK of just under five per cent. So not great, but this is a game that we are all in together.

Interest rate cuts

We will get some new growth and inflation forecasts from the Bank of England on Thursday in its quarterly Monetary Policy Report, and the markets expect these to show better growth and lower inflation than the Bank forecast last November. The thing everyone will be looking for, though, will be signals as to when the first cut in interest rates will come through. At the moment this looks like May.

However, we have to wait a bit longer for the data that will be most relevant to Mr Hunt's tax-cutting hopes. This will be the public accounts for January, which come out on 21 February. As anyone who has just paid their tax bill by the deadline of end-January will be aware, that is the biggest month of the year for government receipts. If revenues are strong, and so far they have been, then a bit of leeway does open up and the question will be how much of that space to use up now. Whatever the Chancellor chooses to do, he has to get the seal of approval from the Office for Budget Responsibility. Put bluntly, what the IMF thinks doesn't much matter. What the OBR says absolutely does.

Actually there are some quite positive short-term indicators. One came out on Wednesday from the Nationwide Building Society. It was that house prices have started the year on an upbeat note, up 0.7 per cent on the month and now down only 0.2 on the year. It looks as though the housing slump is pretty much over, and that prices will gradually recover from now on. Not a boom, so prospective buyers still have a bit of time, but a pick-up in prices has knock-on impact on the economy as a whole. It boosts consumer confidence generally, and when people move house they need to buy stuff to furnish the new home.

Signs of hope

A second positive sign is the solid PMI numbers. These purchasing manager indices are calculated by asking companies whether they expect to increase production, hiring and so on, in the months ahead. They are the best forward-looking indicator for growth, and for the UK they are decently positive. The composite PMI is now 52.2, a seven-month high, with anything over 50 indicating growth. That is actually higher even than the US, and contrasts with the eurozone, where the equivalent numbers are negative. One should never take one month's figures on anything too seriously, but in the short-term the glass does look at least half-full.

As for the longer-term, which is what the IMF and the IFS were really worrying about, I think we should acknowledge that there are huge uncertainties, but also these are as likely to turn out to be positive as they are negative.

We had a projection just this week from the Office for National Statistics that suggested that the UK population might reach 74 million by 2036. That would be nearly another 10 per cent, and since the increase would be fuelled largely by inward migration, it would generate many problems. But it would also generate huge economic growth. All those fiscal forecasts would have to be completely rewritten. Growth creates many problems, but they surely are more manageable than those created by stagnation.

Need to know

Those population forecasts are pretty stunning, and if they prove anywhere near right they will transform the country. It really will be a set of problems about growth - managing the rising numbers, building the homes, educating the young, training those of working age, or perhaps just welcoming those who are already fully-trained for the jobs on offer, and so on. It is such a huge issue that breaking it down into bite-sized chunks would take a lot more than a column. Lots of work ahead.

But there is one thing worth noting here and that is a question which is rarely discussed. It is: why do people seem to prefer to come to Anglophone countries?

There is the whole business of the small boats coming across the Channel. France is lovely - many Brits seem to think it would be a nicer place to live than the UK. Pro-Europeans often argue that continental Europe offers better public services, which may be true, and disparage the UK for its many shortcomings. Scandinavia is much admired. The US, by contrast, is generally attacked for its social failings. Yet it happens to be the second biggest recipient of British emigrants after Australia.

Why the UK?

I have not seen any really good explanations. The Red Cross argues that many people coming across the Channel want to join family and friends who are here. That must be right, but it is a circular argument because it poses the question as to why those family and friends came in the first place.

The Immigration Advice Service looks at the data and concludes: ""Historic reasons for immigration to the UK are, and will remain, consistent as time goes on. The UK has long been a destination for immigrants seeking new opportunities for work or study, and to start a new life with family members."" That must be right too, but it doesn't explain the sudden surge that has led to these new ONS population projections.

My guess, and I would love to dig deeper into the variety of studies, is that there are three broad attractions. One is the strength of the job market, both the informal one and the organised market. A second is the informality of the society, something in common with the US. And the third is language, an attraction that of course applies to other Anglophone countries.

I'll try and return to the subject, because it is going to become more and more important as the years ago by. Meanwhile, though, let's try and think through what we need to do to fit in another seven million people and give them decent and fulfilling lives.","International Monetary Fund thinks this would be a bad idea, and that has caught the headlines.

2024-02-01,Pair admit murder of Belfast man Ian Ogle | ITV News,"Two men were sentenced to life in prison after admitting to the murder of Ian Ogle. Mr Ogle was beaten and stabbed to death close to his Cluan Place home in east Belfast on January 27, 2019 in an attack which a court heard was intended ""to cause serious harm rather than to kill"". A total of five men were charged with his murder and were due to stand trial at Belfast Crown court.

However, barristers for Jonathan Brown (38) and 45-year-old Mark Sewell addressed Mr Justice O'Hara and asked that their clients be re-arraigned on the single charge they faced. As the family of the 45-year-old father-of-two sat in the public gallery, both men were asked to stand and were then charged with murdering Mr Ogle. Brown, from Whinney Hill in Dundonald, was re-arraigned first and when asked how he pleaded to the murder charge, he replied ""guilty."" The court clerk then addressed Sewell, of Glenmount Drive in Newtownabbey. He was also re-arraigned and when asked if he pleaded guilty or not guilty to a charge of murdering Mr Ogle, he answered ""guilty"". Mr Justice O'Hara enquired if there were any further charges against Brown and Sewell and when he was told there were not, he spoke to both men as they stood in the dock. The pair were told by the senior judge: ""Mr Brown and Mr Sewell, since you have both now pleaded guilty to murder I impose a life sentence upon you. ""The minimum length of time which you will be required to serve in prison before your release will be considered will be set at a tariff hearing after the other parts of this trial are finished. ""Your life sentence will start now."" Barristers for both men said the defence had provided a ""basis of plea"" to the Crown, which has been agreed. A prosecuting barrister confirmed this and said: ""Can I make clear what that basis is. It is that the intention was to cause serious harm rather than to kill."" Three men now face trial on the murder charge. They are Glenn Rainey (37) whose address was given as Ballyhalbert Caravan Park, Walter Irvine (42) from Litchfield Street in Belfast and 41-year old Robert Spiers from Millars Park in Dundonald. A fourth defendant, Christopher Haire (54), from Killagan Bend in Belfast, faces a single charge of assisting an offender between January 26 and 29, 2019. Earlier this week, two Belfast men admitted 'lesser' charges arising from the murder. Reece Kirkwood (26) from Tower Court admitted a charge of withholding information concerning an arrestable offence between January 26 and 29, 2019, while Thomas McCartney from Wolff Close pleaded guilty to assisting an offender on the same dates. Last week the only female charged - Jill Morrison (41) of Wolfe Close in Belfast - pleaded guilty to assisting offenders. Further legal arguments in the case will take place next Monday and the trial is listed to start next Tuesday.

2024-02-01,Scotland's missing monkey has been found after five days roaming Highlands | ITV News,"A missing monkey which escaped from a Scottish wildlife park has been caught, the zoo has confirmed to ITV News.

Experts used drones to track the Japanese Macaque which found a way out of its enclosure at Highland Wildlife Park near Kingussie on Sunday.

Responding to a sighting by members of the public, keepers were able to follow the monkey for 45 minutes on Tuesday using drones, but were not able to capture him.

ITV News' Peter Smith confirms the monkey has been caught

Drone footage showed the monkey exploring underneath trees and sitting in undergrowth in a forest.

One couple who saw the monkey in their back garden at the weekend described the experience as ""so surreal"".

Carl Nagle, 49, and his partner, Tiina Salzberg, 50, saw the monkey from their patio doors in Kincraig near Kingussie on Sunday morning.

It nibbled on the nuts in their bird feeder and perched on their garden fence for about 15 minutes before running away.

2024-02-01,Bank of England holds interest rates at 5.25% as expected | ITV News,"The Bank of England has opted to hold interest rates at 5.25%, as inflation is slowly being tamed.

It was largely expected that the central bank's committee would hold at the current rate, which remains the highest it has been since 2008.

The interest rate, or base rate, determines lending rates for banks, impacting savings and loans, such a mortgage deals.

Cost-of-living pressures have eased considerably in recent months, despite a surprise uptick in the latest inflation figure, which rose to 4% for the month of December, driven predominantly by increased alcohol and tobacco prices.

The Bank of England expects inflation to return to its target rate of 2% by the end of 2025.

Financial markets will be looking closely at comments made by the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), watching for hints as to when an interest rate cut could be on the table.

A drop in interest rates would provide some relief for borrowers who have been struck hard by skyrocketing rates in the last couple of years.

Residential mortgage arrears jumped to a six-year high between July and September, according to the Bank of England, with borrowers falling behind loan repayments totalling just under £19 billion.","The Bank of England opts to hold interest rates at 5.25%, as inflation is slowly being tamed.

2024-02-01,James Bulger's mother: I needed to see the faces of my son's killers | ITV News,"As Brianna Ghey's teenage murderers are set to be identified at their sentencing hearing on Friday, and their faces revealed publicly for the first time, ITV News' Evening News Presenter Mary Nightingale sat down with the mother of James Bulger, Denise Fergus, who insisted Brianna's family deserve to know the identity of her killers.

It's the dignity that strikes you immediately. The measured calm of a woman who has been through so much - has suffered such loss.

Denise Fergus faces the world with the implacable determination of a seasoned campaigner.

Nothing and nobody diverts her from her purpose - that of seeking justice for the child victims of murder, and their families.

Denise's son James Bulger died 31 years ago - abducted tortured and killed by two 10-year-old boys.

Anyone old enough to remember the case will not have forgotten the desperation of the young mother, appealing for the return of her precious boy.

Photos of Denise's anguished face, alongside that of her smiling blond haired toddler, filled the front pages for months.

Once the killers, Robert Thompson and John Venables, were convicted, we became horribly familiar with their faces and names, too.

The judge took the unusual decision to identify the pair even though they were under 18. Their childish faces shocked the nation then - and still do.

Three decades later, I'm in Liverpool to get Denise's views on another tragic case of children killing a child, this time, 16-year-old Brianna Ghey.

When Brianna's teenage murderers are sentenced tomorrow, they too will be identified, their faces revealed publicly for the first time.

It remains an unusual decision - and one that raises questions: What purpose does identification actually serve? Who benefits from knowing the names of these two deeply disturbed kids? The public may want to know - but do we need to know?

Denise is in no doubt. She believes it's essential for us to understand exactly who the killers are and what they have done. Anything less, she believes, tells only half the story. We must have full knowledge to understand the crime.

Denise says she needed to see the faces of the boys who killed her James, the faces he saw in the final moments of his life.

That knowledge - however painful - brought her some degree of comfort.

She describes bereavement as a long road; which she and her family are still travelling.

As the Ghey case reaches its conclusion Denise hopes her experience can help Brianna's parents on that terrible journey. If they need to talk, she's there.","Denise Fergus' son James Bulger died 31 years ago - abducted tortured and killed by two 10-year-old boys.

2024-02-01,James Bulger's mother tells ITV News it is right to name Brianna Ghey's killers | ITV News,"Video report by ITV News Evening News Presenter Mary Nightingale, words by Specialist Producer Louisa Felton

They have been known only as Girl X and Boy Y, but tomorrow the teenagers who stabbed Brianna Ghey to death will have their identities and photographs revealed to the public for the first time.

More than 30 years since her own child, James Bulger, was murdered, Denise Fergus says she believes there is a public interest and it is right the judge in Brianna's case has taken the rare decision to lift the anonymity of her killers.

""I do think they should be identified,"" she told ITV News.

""What is the point in telling half a story? Because that's what it'd be like.

""People want to know more, what's happened and want know why.

""You want to know what these people look like, who took this innocent child's life away and destroyed an entire family.""

James was just two when ten year olds Jon Venables and Robert Thompson lured him away from his mother from a Merseyside shopping centre in 2003.

The brutal murder and torture of James is one of the most notorious crimes in British history and chilling CCTV of Venables holding James's hand whilst leading him away to his death became etched in the national consciousness.

The identity of children convicted of serious crimes are usually protected until they turn 18, but Denise says knowing who killed her little boy helped her cope with the tragedy.

""I wanted to know what James's killers looked like,"" she said.

""You want to see the faces that took your child away from you. You want to see the faces of who spent the last few minutes with your child.

""I don't think I would've been able to carry on the way I have not knowing what they looked like.""

Despite her pain, for the past three decades, Denise has tirelessly fought for justice for James and for victims' rights.

She says through her campaigning, she hopes she can help others, like the family of Brianna Ghey.

""I feel so sorry for the family, they're on a long road, a long journey.

""It's just horrendous, to hear again, that two kids have taken not only a young girl's life, but also destroyed the entire family.

""Like Thompson and Venables did with mine. If Brianna's mum wants to meet, I'm more than willing to do that.

""I can't bring James back, but what I'm here for now - if someone wants my help, if I can help them, of course I will do it.""",Denise Fergus believes there is a public interest and it is right the judge has lifted the anonymity of Brianna's killers.

While operations are paused, neighbouring stations will be providing cover for the area.

Last summer, reports of 'grievances raised by volunteers' resulted in a probe into the Pwllheli station.

North Wales Live reports that volunteers had been contacted and informed all volunteering arrangements with crew were being ended.

A letter to crew members stated it was ""unsafe to run an operational lifeboat service with ongoing division, disharmony and an absence of station leadership"".

An RNLI spokesperson said: ""The RNLI is currently unable to operate from Pwllheli due to a serious breakdown in relationships between operational crew members.

""The charity recently carried out a fair, thorough and robust investigation into the concerns raised at Pwllheli Lifeboat Station with experienced investigation managers and are confident our processes have been followed fairly.

They continued: ""Resignations of key station personnel has led to the RNLI reaching the difficult decision to now reset operational personnel at Pwllheli Lifeboat Station.

""Whilst it is recognised that many of the volunteers at Pwllheli remain committed to saving lives at sea, it is unsafe to run an operational lifeboat service with ongoing distrust, disharmony, and an absence of station leadership.""

In a decision that ""had not been taken lightly"", they added that the RNLI had ""ended volunteering arrangements with all operational crew.""

The spokesperson added: ""The sea is a demanding environment, and it takes a deep level of trust between crew members to save lives at sea.

""We are incredibly grateful to all our volunteers at Pwllheli for their service and commitment, however, have been faced with an incredibly complex situation.

""We are committed to providing a duty of care to our staff and volunteers and those we rescue to create a cohesive environment where everyone feels safe and respected.""

2024-02-01,EU will have 'some questions' on DUP deal with government | ITV News,"The EU has ""some questions"" about a UK Government deal to restore power sharing in Northern Ireland that pledges significant changes to post-Brexit trading arrangements, Ireland's premier has said.

Leo Varadkar said that while the European Commission would have queries about the command paper, there were no suggestions on an initial assessment that it contained any ""red flags"".

The DUP has said the government package to revive devolution in Belfast has delivered ""fundamental change"" to UK/EU arrangements on post-Brexit trade.

DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said his party has negotiated ""clear"" alterations to the Windsor Framework by ending routine checks on goods moving from Great Britain to final destinations in Northern Ireland.

Major changes to the UK/EU legal framework would require the approval of Brussels.

Downing Street, however, has said the measures announced on Wednesday do not require specific EU sign-off, calling them ""operational"" changes to the framework, without altering the ""fundamentals"" of the bilateral deal.

The government is fast-tracking two pieces of domestic legislation in Parliament on Thursday that will give effect to commitments made in its Safeguarding The Union command paper.

Their passage would clear the way for the DUP to give the green light for a Stormont return.

MLAs have been put on notice of the prospect of a hastily recalled sitting.

The expectation is Stormont could be back up and running as soon as Saturday, when the Northern Ireland Assembly chamber at Parliament Buildings would witness the historically significant moment of the appointment of its first nationalist first minister, Sinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill.

Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron and Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris both spoke to EU executive vice-president Maros Sefcovic on Wednesday to outline the proposals contained in the command paper.

In a statement, the EU Commission said it would ""carefully analyse"" the measures.

Mr Varadkar was in Brussels on Thursday to attend a European Council meeting. The Taoiseach said he had spoken to commission president Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday about the UK/DUP deal.

""There are definitely going to be some questions about what was agreed between the UK and DUP but nobody is at this stage saying that there's any red flags or anything that gives us major concern,"" Mr Varadkar told reporters in Brussels.

""And certainly, from our point of view in Ireland, our priority was always to make sure there is no hard border between north and south, I think that's been achieved and protected.

""And also to make sure that there would never be any doubt about our position in the single market of the European Union. They were always our priorities, our red lines, and they haven't been breached.""

On Tuesday, before the command paper's publication, the UK and EU did announce a joint move on trade tariff quotas that will increase the ability of Northern Ireland traders to import internationally-sourced agri-food goods via UK free trade deals with other countries.

The paper commits to replacing the Windsor Framework's green lane process at Northern Ireland ports, which requires percentages of goods to be checked as they arrive from Great Britain, with a ""UK internal market system"" that will govern the movement of goods that remain within the United Kingdom.

Checks would still be carried out but on a risk-based/intelligence-led model to combat illegality and disease, rather than routine stops of disembarking lorries.

Businesses using the internal market system would also need to be signed up to a trusted trader scheme.

Sir Jeffrey has hailed the move as a key concession that will effectively scrap the contentious so-called Irish Sea border for goods destined to remain within the UK.

Thursday's motions at Parliament will be on the draft Windsor Framework (Constitutional Status of Northern Ireland) Regulations 2024 and the draft Windsor Framework (Internal Market and Unfettered Access) Regulations 2024.

One will provide legislative assurances on Northern Ireland's constitutional position within the UK, with the other delivering the changes to the trading system by amending the Internal Markets Act.

The measure to reduce checks on GB-NI trade is part of a wide-ranging deal agreed between the DUP and the government that will bring about the restoration of the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland after a two-year hiatus.

The DUP has agreed to drop its two-year blockade of Stormont in exchange for the government measures aimed at addressing its concerns about post-Brexit trading arrangements that created economic barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.

While Sir Jeffrey has secured the backing of a majority of senior party colleagues to accept the deal, there are those within the DUP who remain deeply sceptical of the proposed agreement to restore power sharing.

East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson demonstrated that on Wednesday, heavily criticising the government as the package was debated in the Commons.

The return of Stormont will see the Treasury release a £3.3 billion package to support under-pressure public services in Northern Ireland.

The financial package, announced by the government before Christmas, includes money to settle the demands of striking public sector workers in the region this year.

Despite the moves to restore the devolved institutions, industrial action continued on Thursday, with public transport workers and school support staff picketing in the latest day of strikes in Northern Ireland.","EU has ""some questions"" about a UK Government deal to restore power sharing in Northern Ireland.

2024-02-01,Watch: Conor Bradley inspires Liverpool to victory | ITV News,"Northern Ireland's Conor Bradley was the talk of Anfield after a man-of-the-match performance in the Premier League leaders win over Chelsea.

The Tyrone native got on the scoresheet and got two assists in the 4-1 win. With the game won, the 20-year-old was subbed in the 66th minute and walked off the pitch to a standing ovation.

Bradley becomes the first Northern Ireland player in almost 70 years to score for Liverpool.

Throughout the game the home crowd were singing 'there's only one Conor Bradley,' such was his impact on the game.

Bradley said the game was ""like a dream"" and a special night. He said getting the goal was a ""very proud moment.""

""I couldn't believe it went in, I just thought 'I am going to hit it here' and it went in,"" he told TNT Sports.

""He's incredible,"" said the Liverpool manager who said Bradley was already ""integral"" to his Liverpool team.

""He's a good footballer and has helped us so much.""

The right-back fired into the bottom corner in the 39th minute to double the Reds' lead having earlier provided the pass that led to Diogo Jota's opener midway through the first half.

After Darwin Nunez sent a penalty against the post in first-half stoppage-time - one of four times he hit the woodwork - the advantage was extended in the 65th minute when Dominik Szoboszlai headed in from Bradley's cross. Christopher Nkunku replied before Luis Diaz wrapped things up for Jurgen Klopp's men as they made it 15 league matches unbeaten, and four successive wins, in their first top-flight outing since the German's announcement that he is to step down as boss at the end of the season. A miserable evening for Mauricio Pochettino's Chelsea ended a three-match winning run as they stayed 10th.

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says it is a credit to their academy players that his side have emerged unscathed from a difficult January to lead the Premier League by five points. Bradley has impressed hugely and put in his second successive man-of-the-match display with his first Liverpool goal and two assists in the victory.

But with Trent Alexander-Arnold close to full match fitness after two substitute appearances, it has given Klopp a decision to make ahead of Sunday's trip to Arsenal. ""There is no situation. It is just how it is,"" said Klopp.

""We had seven games in January with 11 days off in between. We couldn't have put the string of results together without the kids, (Jarell) Quansah, Conor and we had midfielders out so we played with James McConnell at six. ""These boys used this situation. I am happy they all could perform the way they did. The academy is doing an incredible job."" Striker Darwin Nunez had one of those games where he did everything but score, becoming the first player since Opta records began in 2003 to hit the woodwork four times, once from the penalty spot.",Conor Bradley was man-of-the-match in Liverpool's 4-1 win over Chelsea.

2024-02-01,Luke Littler: 'I'd still be asleep if I wasn't playing darts'  | ITV News,"Darts teenage sensation Luke Littler joked that he'd ""probably still be asleep"" if he wasn't throwing darts for a living.

The 17-year-old is set to make his Premier League debut, which kicks off at Cardiff's Utility Arena on Thursday 1 February.

Littler will take on world number one Luke Humphries in what will be a rematch of the highly anticipated World Darts Championship final earlier this year.

He'll be hoping for revenge after Humphries beat the teenager 7-4 at Alexandra Palace.

Despite that defeat, Littler has continued to ascend the upper echelons of darts elite, beating Michael van Gerwen to win the Bahrain Masters in the middle of the month.

He's grown to be one of the most recognisable players in the sport and now he'll embark on the 2024 Premier League Darts which begins in Cardiff before travelling across the UK and Europe.

The play-offs will take place at the O2 Arena in London at the end of May with a jackpot of £270,000 up for grabs.

Quarter Final matches at Cardiff's Utility Arena

Reacting to the gruelling schedule of matches ahead Littler said: ""It is how the calendar pans out. This is what I signed up for - a busy schedule all year long.""

He added: ""I just keep myself to myself. That is what I do and whatever routines I do.

""When I was going to the airport for Bahrain I said to my mum that I just wanted 10-20 weeks off but the schedule is just crazy.

""I know when I get a day off, I just make the most of it, and I have always said once I get into the venue, that is when I am in the zone.""

When asked if the pressure gets to him, he said: ""I just do what I do, do what I do best and throw my darts on the board.

""I don't really want to practise at home, because once I get a day off I don't want to be spending hours and hours on the board, so I spend hours and hours on my Xbox instead.""

Littler's achievement in reaching the world final as a 16-year-old will rank among the great British sporting achievements of the year.

While his life continues to change seemingly on a weekly basis, staying grounded is not something the teenager appears to struggle with.

He said: ""It is what it is. When you get to a world final at such a young age, you are going to get spotted, but you have just to get used to it.""

During the contest, Littler will face Welshman and PDC World number five Gerwyn Price. He will take on world number four Nathan Aspinall at the Utility Arena.

When asked what can be expected from the night of the darts, Gerwyn Price said: ""Well, especially in Premier League, it's electric and it's a great atmosphere.

""It's a party atmosphere. You can watch darts on TV but until you go to a Premier League venue like Cardiff or anywhere really, it's nothing like it.""","Luke Littler jokes he'd ""probably still be asleep"" if he wasn't throwing darts for a living.

2024-02-01,Shakespeare's Globe theatre defends casting non-disabled actor as Richard III | ITV News,"Shakespeare's Globe theatre has defended casting a non-disabled actor as Richard III in this summer's production following backlash.

The theatre has faced criticism after it announced its artistic director Michelle Terry would play the villainous king, who has historically been portrayed with a physical disability.

In a lengthy statement, Michelle Terry acknowledged any ""pain and harm"" caused by her casting and added: ""All programming and casting decisions across all seasons are made as consciously and rigorously as they possibly can be, and always in dialogue with members of our many communities.""

It went on to say: ""I will not alter my physicality to explore it. I will not be playing Richard with a visible or physical impairment, and we will frame this production in such a way as to make it very clear the lens through which this interpretation is being explored.

""This production does not equal a permanent revision of the play or the eternal erasure of the character's impairment, or a rewriting of a historical figure.

""I acknowledge that for many, Richard III is an iconic disabled figure. I understand that this feels like a missed opportunity for a disabled artist to play a disabled character on a major UK stage, but it will come around again.""

The Globe's statement follows backlash from actors with disabilities who disagreed with Terry's casting.

In the play, Richard III describes himself as ""deformed, unfinish'd"".

An open letter by campaign group Disabled Artists Alliance, signed by more than 100 disabled theatre professionals, said it was ""outraged and disappointed"" by the decision and called for an ""immediate recast"" of the role.

It went on: ""Richard III is an iconic disabled character. Perhaps the most famous disabled character in the British canon.

""To see The Globe announce this casting within this production is shocking... The production cannot be successfully performed with a non-physically disabled actor at the helm, steering the complex and vitally important narrative.

""There's been incredible progress made across all facets and routes of the industry regarding disabled inclusion, including the casting of disabled actors across disabled and traditionally non-disabled roles. But this role belongs to us. It is offensive and distasteful for Richard to be portrayed by someone outside the community.""

Brittanie Pallett, an actor with a disability, wrote online: ""Why is an artistic director of any theatre, hiring themselves to play the lead when its not their casting or lived experience?""

""Before anyone says it doesn't matter. Every time this happens more harm than good is done to disabled communities through misrepresentation.""

In 2023, Bridgerton actor Adoja Andoh played Richard III in a production at Liverpool's Playhouse.

She said she wanted to explore how people are ""demonised"" for what they look like.

The skeleton of Richard III was discovered beneath a car park in Leicester in 2012.

He has historically been portrayed as having one shoulder larger than the other, but tests revealed he suffered from scoliosis or curvature of the spine.","Shakespeare's Globe theatre defends casting of a non-disabled actor as Richard III.

2024-02-01,XL bully dogs could be seized and destroyed as ban comes into force | ITV News,"Illegal XL bully owners have been told to comply with officers if their dog is seized as their behaviour could influence a court's decision to destroy their dog.

It is now a criminal offence to own an XL bully dog in England and Wales without an exemption certificate, meaning unregistered pets will be taken and owners possibly fined and prosecuted.

Around 40,000 of the large bulldog-type American breed were expected to have been registered before the deadline on Wednesday afternoon, but there may be thousands without certificates.

National Police Chiefs' Council dangerous dogs lead Mark Hobrough has urged members of the public to report any XL bully owners not following the rules so officers can assess the animals.

Seized dogs will be taken to kennels before a court decides if they should either be destroyed or deemed not a danger to public safety.

Assistant Chief Constable Hobrough said: ""I would urge everybody to comply with the law and the legislation. If people haven't put their dog on the database already they are committing an absolute offence.

""We are as police forces going to be enforcing the law. We didn't create the law but we do enforce the law and we will have to execute warrants and seize dogs and take action towards such dog owners.

""I would encourage strongly people to be compliant if that were the situation with their own dogs because one of the very tests that is made about a dog or an owner [in court] is that the dog is not aggressive, but also that the owner is fit and responsible and not aggressive also.

""So if either of those things were not complied with, then there would be no option for a court then but to destroy the dog.""

Have you heard our new podcast Talking Politics? Every week Tom, Robert and Anushka dig into the biggest issues dominating the political agenda...

ACC Hobrough said officers, if met with resistance, will take ""proportionate action with minimum use of force"" to seize dogs.

The recent ban may spark higher demand for kennels and cause ""logistical challenges"" for officers, ACC Hobrough said, with police forces ""actively looking to enhance"" the numbers they can hold.

There are 137 dog legislation officers across the country, with at least one in every force.

The government move to ban XL bullies followed a series of attacks on people.

In October last year, a woman was injured after she was attacked by her own American XL bully in Norfolk.

A month earlier 52-year-old Ian Price, from Staffordshire, died in hospital after being attacked by two American XL bullies.

In November 2021, Jack Lis, 10, was killed by a American XL bully while at a friend's house in South Wales.

Environment Secretary Steve Barclay said: ""The ban on XL bullies is now in place meaning it is illegal to own one of these dogs unless it has been registered.

""We have delivered our pledge to bring in this important measure to protect public safety, and we expect all XL bully owners to comply with the strict conditions.""

When the ban was announced the government launched a compensation scheme for owners to have their dogs put down, with more than 150 claims received.

The total number of XL bullies, estimated by animal groups, has ranged between 50,000 and 100,000, the RSPCA has said.

RSPCA dog welfare expert Dr Samantha Gaines said: ""The ban on XL bullies not only remains devastating for so many dogs, but is also taking a heavy toll on owners, on rescue centre staff who have grown close to dogs in their care, and to veterinary teams who face the prospect of being asked to put to sleep healthy dogs whose behaviour poses no risk.""

A Dog Control Coalition spokesperson said: ""We are concerned about the rise in dog-related incidents and steps must be taken to protect the public, but we do not believe that banning any type or breed of dog will stop these types of incidents from occurring.

""A complete overhaul of the existing dog control legislation is the only way to tackle the root causes of the tragic incidents we have seen in recent years.

""The government must urgently take steps to deal with the unscrupulous breeders who are putting profit before welfare, and the irresponsible owners whose dogs are dangerously out of control.""

The Association of Dogs and Cats Homes (ADCH) also warned of increased abandonment rates and said the new rules may lead to a ""postcode lottery"" for vets being able to help owners meet the terms.

Figures show between 2001 and 2021 there were three fatal dog attacks a year, compared with 23 over the two-year period after that, with XL bullies said to be behind many of them.

The breed was added to the Dangerous Dogs Act on October 31 last year.

Restrictions then came into force dictating the dogs must be kept on a lead and muzzled in public.

Breeding, selling or abandoning the dogs also became illegal as of December 31 2023.

Owners of XL bully dogs in Scotland will also be subject at a later date to the safeguards after the Scottish government replicated legislation in place south of the border.

A decision on whether to add to the list of banned breeds in Northern Ireland would be for locally elected ministers.

2024-02-01,Why Summerland remains the forgotten disaster and how it should be remembered | ITV News,"Despite being the Isle of Man's greatest tragedy, few have heard of the Summerland fire.

Most will know of Hillsborough, many will remember Grenfell, and almost everyone is now aware of the Post Office scandal.

Yet, on a small island in the Irish sea, lies what remains of a building where 50 people lost their lives.

A disaster that shook the Manx community to its core, and left many families grieving alone in the UK.

Last year, we set out to mark the 50th anniversary by giving a platform to those still suffering.

An opportunity to share the horrific events that unfolded and hear of the lingering injustice still felt by many today.

Before filming began, we were acutely aware of the small number of people who had previously spoken out about the disaster.

Some had spoken publicly, but the story never appeared to reach a wider audience in the way that it perhaps should have done.

If you asked someone on the island about Summerland, they would have likely heard about it, but often be reluctant to talk about it.

Meanwhile, the majority of people in the UK were unfamiliar with Summerland as a leisure complex, let alone the disaster that unfolded.

That was until one survivor took the brave decision to speak publicly about her trauma for the first time on camera.

Jackie Hallam was holidaying in the Isle of Man with her mum Lorna, and best friend Jane.

On that fateful night in 1973, the trio were inside Summerland as the fire ripped through the complex.

Both Lorna and Jane died in the blaze.

Jackie escaped with severe burns, and a trauma that would last a lifetime.

Last year, Jackie faced her trauma once more - returning to the Isle of Man and revisiting the Summerland site for the first time in 50 years.

All of which highlighted the lived experience of those still suffering from the fire, half a century later.

It was Jackie's story that really alerted people to the shock and scale of what happened that night, and after our 45-minute interview, it became clear how silenced she had felt in the years that came before.

Unable to speak out due to that feeling of isolation.

But once she had spoken, that relief soon turned to frustration - a sense of injustice that had been festering in the years that followed.

It did not take long for a campaign group to form, calling on the Isle of Man Government to apologise for any governance failings at the time of the blaze.

Alongside a commitment to acknowledging that the 'death by misadventure' verdict, given to those who died, was wrong.

A verdict that implies the individual is to blame for their own death, relinquishing any responsibility from anybody else.

This was the line that would bring the story into the present day.

The Post Office scandal, Hillsborough, contaminated blood - all examples where the blame is taken away from those in control, and placed firmly on the victims.

And it is that sense of injustice that is also felt by the 'Justice for Summerland' campaigners today.

Because while the Chief Minister of the Isle of Man did make a historic apology for any governance failings, he has not committed to looking into the 'death by misadventure' verdicts.

But this story appears far from over.

As Jackie concludes in the documentary: ""That verdict will not stand us death by misadventure, but we will be taking it further, it doesn't end here.""

2024-02-01,Industrial action continues despite Stormont restoration progress | ITV News,"Trade union strikes have again brought public transport services to a standstill this Thursday.

School support workers are also engaging in a 48-hour walk-out over ongoing disputes about pay.

On January 18, tens of thousands of public sector workers took part in an unprecedented day of strike action.

The latest wave of industrial action comes as legislation is to be debated in Westminster which could see the restoration of the Northern Ireland's devolved institutions in the coming days.

Chris Heaton-Harris has been urged to release funding to make delayed pay awards in the absence of a functioning devolved government.

The Secretary of State has refused, saying the matter is a devolved one.

The Government has offered a financial package worth more than £3 billion to accompany the return of a devolved Executive in Belfast.

A portion of which has been ringfenced for public sector pay awards.

Some members of the public and business leaders have called on unions to suspend strike action in recognition of the progress being made towards a return to powersharing.

Peter Macklin, Regional Organiser of transport union GMB said: ""Regardless of the latest developments at Stormont, our members are still facing the prospect of a zero percent offer made last year being imposed.

""A few years ago, these workers were being hailed as frontline heroes. They deserve better and they are ready and willing to strike to secure it.

""At any point, if a meaningful pay offer is received then that is something our members will consider and respond to appropriately but in the absence of any movement we have no alternative but to proceed with the planned action.""",Trade union strikes bring public transport services to a standstill this Thursday.

Miranda Worby's love affair with the plastic ponies started when she was given her first one at the age of four.

Now aged 41, she reckons she has about 4,000 of them which she keeps in the home she shares with her partner Ian in Lowestoft, Suffolk.

The collection has now got so big that the couple decided to move a larger house so that Ms Worby could dedicate an entire room to her horsey hoard.

""When I was little, I always wanted a real horse, and of course my parents said no, so that's where My Little Pony came in,"" she told ITV News Anglia.

""I love the fact that they're all different. They're all different colours and there's so many of them.""

Over the years, Miranda has spent thousands of pounds on her pony paraphernalia and believes she now has one of the biggest collections of the toy in the UK, if not the world.

Her favourite pony is Sundance - a character she says is a ""little bit clumsy like me"" but ""always did good in the end.""

Although the toys are still the mane attraction in her house, Ms Worby has now even bought a pony amusement arcade ride.

2024-02-01,Grenfell Tower: Injured firefighters have settled High Court case | ITV News,"Firefighters who were injured in the Grenfell Tower fire have settled High Court claims for a total of £20 million.

The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said some of the 114 firefighters involved had not been able to work again because of ""severe trauma"" following the blaze in June 2017.

Defendants included companies that made the tower block's cladding and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the London Fire Commissioner.

The fire at the residential tower block in North Kensington, west London, on 14th June 2017 killed 72 people.

Matt Wrack, Fire Brigades Union general secretary, said: ""The aftermath of the Grenfell Tower tragedy is a stark reminder of the systemic failings of building safety and government accountability.

""Firefighters, many of whom have been deeply affected by the horrors they witnessed, continue to advocate for those living in unsafe conditions.

The blaze was the deadliest in the United Kingdom since the Second World War, resulting in 72 deaths and leaving many residents injured and homeless. The public inquiry into the blaze is expected to publish its final report this year.

He added: ""This was a crime of deregulation and negligence - a consequence of private profit being prioritised over public safety. Nearly seven years later, the fight for justice and change goes on.

""The Fire Brigades Union stands shoulder to shoulder with the victims and survivors of Grenfell Tower, and with leaseholders and campaign groups across the UK.""

Vincent Reynolds from the personal injury team at Thompsons Solicitors, which represented the firefighters, said: ""The Grenfell Tower fire left an indelible mark on the firefighters who responded to the call.

""Many bear the psychological scars of that night, struggling with trauma from the harrowing experience. Their testimonies reveal the profound personal sacrifice of showing such extraordinary courage in the face of an impossible situation.""

He added: ""The incident exposed them to unimaginable scenes and sparked a deeper reflection on fire and building safety policy.

""Their experiences on that night, and in its aftermath, highlight the human element of firefighting, underscoring their commitment to their duty despite the immense risks and emotional toll.

Gosling spoke about his disappointment for Gerwig and Robbie after being snubbed in their individual categories.

2024-02-01,'Privilege of my life': Tory MP to step down from seat over safety fears | ITV News,"Conservative Justice Minister Mike Freer said he will stand down at the next general election after a series of death threats and an arson attack on his constituency office.

He has served as the Finchley and Golders Green MP since 2010 but now says it is time to ""say enough"" as he can no longer put his family through the anxiety over his safety.

In a letter to his local Conservative association Mr Freer wrote it ""will be an enormous wrench to step down"", but that the attacks ""have weighed heavily on me and my husband, Angelo"".

The MP and his staff decided to wear stab vests when attending scheduled public events in his constituency after learning that Ali Harbi Ali had watched his Finchley office before going on to knife Sir David to death during a constituency surgery in 2021.

He said: ""Since my election as MP in 2010 I have sadly had several serious threats to my personal safety.

""The attacks by Muslims Against Crusades, Ali Harbi Ali and the recent arson attack (where the motives remain unclear) have weighed heavily on me and my husband, Angelo.""

""These serious incidents are alongside the many 'low level' incidents. No MP can operate effectively without the support of their spouse and wider family.

""Sadly the serious incidents place intolerable stress on them too.""

Mr Freer won his seat by around 6,600 votes at the last general election in 2019, seeing off a Liberal Democrat challenger.

He added: ""It will be an enormous wrench to step down, it has been the privilege of my life to serve the wonderfully diverse and vibrant area that is Finchley & Golders Green.""

""Serving the constituents and getting things done is what makes the job worthwhile.""

Mr Freer joins a series of MPs who have announced their intention not to contest the next election, which is expected later this year.","Justice Minister Mike Freer says he will stand down at the next general election.

2024-02-01,School drafts in sniffer dog to stop pupils vaping | ITV News,"A secondary school is planning to draft in a sniffer dog to crack down on children bringing vapes on to the premises.

City of Norwich School, which is run by the Ormiston Academies Trust, said it didn't currently have an issue with vaping, but wanted to take ""proactive steps"" to prevent it.

As part of the proposals, a ""passive deterrence dog"" will be taken around the school one day in February, a spokesperson confirmed.

The dogs are more commonly used to hunt for drugs and explosives.

""While we do not currently have an issue with this [vaping] at the school, we are aware this is a rising challenge within society, and therefore want to take proactive steps to help counter and deter this,"" a spokesperson for City of Norwich School said.

""The organisation that is supporting this [the use of a sniffer dog] has significant experience delivering this service in schools.""

The use of the sniffer dog is just one of a whole raft of measures being brought in by the school which will also stage special assemblies and direct pupils to help if they need it.

It comes just days after the prime minister announced that disposable vapes would soon be banned in a bid to tackle the alarming rise in young people taking up the habit.

New £100 fines will also be brought in for shops in England and Wales which sell vapes illegally to anyone under the age of 18.

In the last three years, the number of children vaping has tripled, with 9% of 11 to 15-year-olds now using them.","School to draft in a ""passive deterrence dog"" to crack down on vaping.

2024-02-01,Billionaire halts Harvard donations as it produces 'whiny snowflakes' | ITV News,"A hedge fund billionaire who has donated more than $500 million to Harvard University over the years has halted contributions to his alma mater after claiming the elite institution produces ""whiny snowflakes"".

Ken Griffin, one of the richest people in the world, joins a growing list of donors to Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania, Columbia and other top schools who have decided to close their chequebooks.

At a conference in Miami on Tuesday, Mr Griffin expressed deep frustration with the state of American universities.

The founder of hedge fund Citadel, the 55-year-old said he is no longer supporting Harvard financially but would like that to change.

Mr Griffin suggested that students at elite schools are ""just caught up in the rhetoric of oppressor and oppressee and... just like whiny snowflakes.""

""Until Harvard makes it very clear that they're going to resume their role as (educators of) young American men and women to be leaders, to be problem solvers, to take on difficult issues, I am not interested in supporting the institution,"" he told CNBC.

Harvard has not yet publicly commented.

The donor backlash at Ivy League schools, a group of eight prestigious private colleges and universities in the US, raises questions about the sway wealthy individuals hold over educational institutions.

Just last April, Griffin made a $300 million (£237m) gift to Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

At the time, the billionaire praised Harvard as a ""great institution"" and hailed FAS for being ""committed to advancing ideas that will shape humanity's future, while providing important insight into our past.""

Over four decades, Griffin has donated more than $500 million (£395m), Harvard said at the time.

That includes a $150 million (£118m) contribution to financial aid in 2014 that Harvard said holds the record for the ""largest single gift to undergraduate financial aid and to Harvard College.""

Mr Griffin, who has built a fortune that Bloomberg estimates is $37 billion, is now expressing concern about the direction of elite schools and diversity, equity and inclusion policies [DEI].

""Will America's elite universities get back to the roots of educating American children - young adults - to be the future leaders of our country or are they going to maintain being lost in the wilderness of microaggressions and a DEI agenda that has no real endgame,"" he said.

DEI policies have emerged as a flashpoint at major universities and in the business world, with some arguing they have gone too far.

A number of other major Harvard donors have halted their donations to the school, including former Victoria's Secret billionaire Leslie Wexner and billionaire Len Blavatnik, whose family foundation has donated at least $270 million to Harvard.

Only last month, its president, Claudine Gay, resigned over fierce criticism of the University's response to the Hamas attack on Israel and allegations of professional plagiarism.","Ken Griffin, one of the richest people in the world, has halted contributions to Harvard.

2024-02-01,How could XL bully owners be in breach of the law and should you report them? | ITV News,"The deadline has passed for owners of XL bully dogs to apply for certificates of exemption to keep their pets before a ban on the breed comes into force, Chris Choi reports as thousands of dogs could potentially face being destroyed

Words by Hannah Ward-Glenton, ITV News Multimedia Producer

XL bully owners are now no longer able to apply for exemption certificates if they want to keep their dogs, with the ban on the breed set to come into force on Thursday.

It follows restrictions imposed at the end of last year after a series of attacks involving XL bullies, with one man dying after being fatally injured by one of the dogs last year.

So what are the rules and should you report dogs you see in public?

Leads, muzzles and exemption certificates

The government introduced new measures in December dictating that XL bullies must be kept on a lead, be muzzled in public and be kept in secure enough accommodation that they cannot escape.

It will be considered a criminal offence if owners are not complying with the new rules.

From February 1, it will also be a criminal offence to own an XL bully dog in England and Wales without a certificate of exemption.

To qualify for a certificate, owners needed to prove their XL bully would be neutered by June 30 if they were aged one or older on January 31, or by December 31, 2024 if dogs are younger than 12 months.

Applications for exemption certificates closed at midday on Wednesday.

As well as neutering their animals, XL bully owners wanting to certify their dog as exempt needed to pay an application fee, hold third party public liability insurance for their pets and ensure the dogs are microchipped.

The first of a two-stage approach to new legal safeguards on XL bully dogs in Scotland will come into force on February 23, subject to parliamentary approval.

From this date, it will remain legal to own an XL bully dog, but owners must ensure their dogs are muzzled and on a lead when in a public place. Selling, gifting or exchanging XL bully dogs will also be prohibited.

Stage two of the new rules, which come into force from July 31, will make it an offence to own an XL bully without an exemption certificate or having applied for an exemption certificate.

Should you report XL bullies?

The Department for Environmental Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) advises that anybody with concerns about an XL bully, or any other dog that is dangerously out of control, should get in touch with their local police force.

Each police service should have an officer trained in all dog-related legislation and have a good knowledge of the identification of the prohibited types.

The same guidance applies for all dogs banned in the UK according to the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, such as Japanese tosas and pit bull terriers.

""Large dog with a muscular body and blocky head, suggesting great strength and power for its size. Powerfully built individual.""

Other XL bully features include prominent cheek muscles, a well-defined jaw, long muscled shoulder blades, strong broad legs and a medium-length, low set tail.

Male dogs tend to be upwards of 51cm tall, while adult females are usually around 48cm.

Defra also highlights a dog could be classified as an XL bully even if it wasn't sold as such, including if it is a cross breed that looks more like an XL bully than any other type.

What impact will the ban have?

The RSPCA has previously said the measures were ""not the answer"" and warned of a ""huge risk"" that rescue centres and vets will be unable to cope with a likely surge in demand.

The Association of Dogs and Cats Homes (ADCH) warned of increased abandonment rates and said the new rules may lead to a ""postcode lottery"" for vets being able to help owners meet the terms.

There has also been criticism the number of attacks is unlikely to drop as a result of the ban.

XL bullies were added to the Dangerous Dogs Act on October 31 last year, giving owners two months to prepare for the first stage of restrictions.

People with dangerously out of control dogs can be jailed for 14 years and banned from owning animals, and their pets can be put down.","XL bully owners no longer able to apply for exemption certificates if they want to keep their pets.

2024-02-01,A new generation votes with its feet as Cuba remains suspended in time | ITV News,"Cuba has endured one of the longest economic blockades in history.

Since Fidel Castro's rise to power and the Cuba missile crisis in 1962, the United States has kept this Caribbean island in a stranglehold, limiting key imports and trade.

Now, a new generation is voting with its feet, fleeing either illegally or through the limited legal routes to seek a better life beyond these shores.

Beside a churning sea, on a shore just 90 miles from the US, I met Stacy Miranda Valle who is training to be a lawyer.

Almost a third of her class has left Cuba. Life his hard here and the future for her generation is not bright. So, young Cubans are forming part of a modern exodus.

In the past two years, almost 425,000 people have upped and gone - that's almost four percent of the population.

To understand what is driving ordinary Cubans to turn their back on their home, I accompanied Laura Cepero Elordi shopping near her home which she shares with four generations of her family.

She shows me how basics like bread and vegetables are limited by the government. It makes every meal a challenge.

To help make ends meet she tells me she has three jobs, her husband works two. They don't go hungry, but putting food on the table is a struggle.

Cuba's President for the first time in six decades is not a member of the Castro family.

Miguel Luis Canel is a new leader with an old message.

During a conference on migration in Havana, he says: ""Our country is being punished for our desire to be free, independent and sovereign, 90 miles away from an empire (the US).""

Successive US administrations have left sanctions in place, partly because the powerful Cuban lobby in Miami is so vocal in its opposition to the government in Havana.

The degree to which the embargo is enforced has waxed and waned under different presidents, but it has always remained in place.

US sanctions towards Cuba are codified by statutes, meaning only Congress can lift the embargo.

Officials also stress there are important exemptions and authorisations which permit agricultural products, medicine, medical devices, and other humanitarian supplies, to be exported to Cuba.

An official told On Assignment on background: ""US sanctions are one set of tools in our broader effort toward Cuba, including to advance democracy, promote respect for human rights, and support the Cuban people exercising the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

""US sanctions have an impact, but Cuba's mismanagement of its most productive sectors is a primary driver of the current economic crisis.""

Whoever is to blame, the results are seen everywhere in Cuba; from the old cars kept on the roads, because of the difficulty and expense in importing modern vehicles, to the decaying buildings and limited tourism.

The blockade has left this a country preserved in aspic, freezing time and limiting the opportunities of those trapped behind a sanctions regime which is older than many of those whom it affects.

2024-02-01,Alec Baldwin pleads not guilty to manslaughter following fatal shooting   | ITV News,"Alec Baldwin has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter after a 2021 fatal shooting during a rehearsal on a movie set in New Mexico.

The US actor also filed a waiver of arraignment opting to plead not guilty a day before a scheduled court appearance in the First Judicial District Court of Santa Fe, New Mexico, which will now not take place.

In court documents, he said: ""I plea not guilty to all of the charges in the complaint or citation.""

Baldwin, the lead actor and a co-producer on the Western movie Rust, was pointing a gun at cinematographer Halyna Hutchins during a rehearsal on a movie set outside Santa Fe in October 2021 when the gun went off, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza.

Baldwin has said he pulled back the hammer, but not the trigger, and the gun fired.

He was initially charged in January last year, but those charges were formally dismissed three months later.

Earlier in January 2024, special prosecutors brought the case before a grand jury in Santa Fe, after receiving a new analysis of the gun, and Baldwin was re-charged.

Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the film's armourer, has previously pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter and evidence tampering, and is set to go on trial on February 21.","Alec Baldwin pleads not guilty to involuntary manslaughter.

2024-02-01,Postmaster shunned from home town after Horizon scandal returns 15 years later | ITV News,"'People thought we were criminals': Sub-postmaster Peter Holloway is joined by ITV News Correspondent Chloe Keedy as he returns to the town he fled after the Horizon Scandal

There are few things for which Peter Holloway now counts himself lucky. Living near the coast in Northumberland is one of them. Him and his wife Sue moved here, he says, ""to get as far away as possible from where we used to live"".

Peter and Sue's old life was on a different coast, more than 300 miles away. He lived in the Dorset village of West Lulworth, and ran the Post Office in Wareham, nearby.

That was 15 years ago, before Peter was suspended from his job by the Post Office, which, he says, had accused him of stealing tens of thousands of pounds.

The money had gone missing from Peter's branch, and the Post Office threatened to prosecute him if he didn't pay it back.

""I paid the losses out of our own funds,"" he said. ""So eventually it got to a point where we were basically working for no money because we were paying so much money each month to the Post Office.

""I had to draw cash out on the credit card to pay the staff.

""They said you must be stealing, and I said 'why would I do that?' If money is short, I would have to pay it back. Why would I steal?""

The shortfalls were caused by the now famously faulty Post Office Horizon software, but neither Peter, nor his customers, knew that at the time. Over the years, Peter estimates he lost more than £100,000.

""We were ostracised,"" he recalls. ""People didn't want to know us. Financially, it ruined us. We nearly lost everything we had worked for all our lives. People thought we were criminals.""

Sue is still too traumatised to talk about it. But Peter, accompanied by his daughter Sam, agreed make the difficult journey back to Dorset with us to see the people and the Post Office he hasn't set eyes on for over a decade.

How did he feel about doing that? ""Nervous,"" he told me.

He explained he and Sue had been back only once before, not long after they left. But he said they were made to feel unwelcome and found it too upsetting. They had vowed never to go back.

""I never thought I'd be standing here again in my life,"" Peter said, peering in through the door of his old Post Office. ""I was really not looking forward to it. It brings back terrible memories, but I know it's not my fault.

""The government and [the Post Office] are still not giving us our compensation, they're not paying us back our money, they won't pay our legal fees.

""They are just wicked people. We were doing our best to make their business a success and they just stabbed us in the back and threw us away like dirt.""

Their previously perfect life here, he says, was then made even more difficult by the fact that many of his customers and neighbours trusted the Post Office rather than believing him.

As we drove into the village of West Lulworth, he admitted that he was feeling apprehensive about how he would be greeted after all this time.

Those that knew Peter welcomed him with open arms, telling me that ""he should never have had to leave"".

Some of Peter's old neighbours invited us in for a cup of tea and a catch up. But even Dave, a close friend who always stood by him, admitted there was a time when he struggled to make sense of it all.

""If you're honest with yourself, you know there's that - at the back of your mind - even if it was your own children, at the back of your mind, you'd have thought - 'is there a possibility?' With such a trusted institution as the Post Office, it's what made that germ of doubt.""

Dave's wife, Elaine, agrees. ""There is a phrase,"" she says, ""there's no smoke without fire.""

Peter says he feels ""incredibly bitter"" towards the Post Office now.

He is still waiting for repayment for what he lost, and is calling on the prime minister and the government to speed up the compensation scheme, as well as pay the legal fees of the group of sub-postmasters who took the Post Office to court.

It's taken 15 years and a TV drama to make Peter finally feel his story would be understood.

What he didn't know, as we drove back towards the town of Wareham, is how many people were waiting to hear it.

We had tracked down some of the old customers and friends he hadn't seen since he left, who were waiting inside a community cafe to surprise Peter with a banner that read ""welcome back.""

They called him a ""pillar of the community"", as Peter, becoming emotional, told them he had been ""through hell"".

He told me he had been dreading this trip, but said that, to his surprise, it had been part of a ""healing process.""

He never did blame the people here. It's the Post Office he says he can't forgive - for taking him away from them for so long.

The Post Office declined to comment on Peter's story.

A Department for Business and Trade Spokesperson said: ""We are committed to righting the wrongs of the past, ensuring sub-postmasters are rightly compensated for the hardship they have endured.""

The spokesperson added the department is ""speeding up compensation"" and bringing forward ""legislation... to overturn the convictions of those who were wrongly prosecuted"".","Sub-postmaster Peter Holloway returns to the town he fled after Horizon Scandal.

An image of Georgie Purcell was doctored to show her midriff and inflate the size of her breasts.

Purcell is the youngest woman in Victoria states parliament and has frequently called out the ""constant sexualisation and objectification"" of women. She appeared on the show to discuss the government's rejection of a duck hunting ban.

The Sesame Street character had initially posted on X, formerly Twitter, to say hello to followers: ""Elmo is just checking in! How is everybody doing?"" he wrote.

But no one could have predicted what would happen next, as the internet bombarded Elmo with their life problems.

Thousands used the platform to inform the red furry Muppet that they were not doing that great. One person wrote: ""Elmo I'm suffering from existential dread over here.""

Another said: ""Every morning, I cannot wait to go back to sleep. Every Monday, I cannot wait for Friday to come. Every single day and every single week for life.""

Even celebrities weighed in. The Hunger Games star Rachel Zegler wrote that she was ""resisting the urge to tell Elmo that I am kinda sad"".

The original post accrued millions of views and thousands of responses, all from people jokingly - and earnestly - telling Elmo about what's keeping them up at night.

Elmo had no choice but to post again: ""Wow! Elmo is glad he asked! Elmo learned that it is important to ask a friend how they are doing.

""Elmo will check in again soon, friends! Elmo loves you. #EmotionalWellBeing"".

The widespread distress even forced US President Joe Biden to comment: ""I know how hard it is some days to sweep the clouds away and get to sunnier days,"" he wrote on X.

""Our friend Elmo is right: We have to be there for each other, offer our help to a neighbor in need, and above all else, ask for help when we need it. Even though it's hard, you're never alone.""

Fellow Sesame Street characters joined in to show their support.

The Cookie Monster wrote: ""Me here to talk it out whenever you want. Me will also supply cookies. #EmotionalWellBeing""

2024-02-01,Chancellor says less room for tax cuts in spring Budget than in autumn | ITV News,"Jeremy Hunt confirmed that he warned the Cabinet there is less scope for tax reductions in his March 6 Budget, ITV News' Political Editor Robert Peston reports

Jeremy Hunt has warned he does not have the ""kind of room"" for tax cuts in his spring Budget as he was able to announce last autumn.

The chancellor confirmed that he warned the Cabinet there is less scope for tax reductions in his March 6 Budget despite clamour within the Tory ranks for cuts to try to woo voters.

The senior Conservative pointed to ""major structural weaknesses"" in the UK economy as being a factor, highlighting how the US, France and Germany are all more productive.

Speaking on ITV's Peston, Mr Hunt said: ""We go through a process ahead of every budget and autumn statement where you don't actually know the final numbers until a couple of weeks before. And we're still in the middle of that process.

""As things stand at the moment - things can change - it doesn't look like I'll have the kind of room that I had for those very big tax cuts in the autumn.

""And I did mention that to the Cabinet, yes.""

The comments come after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday warned further tax cuts could risk the government's ability to invest money in the NHS and other vital services.

Mr Hunt cut national insurance in November's autumn statement, a move the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) thinks will cost the Treasury around £9.76 billion in the 2028 tax year.

In a reduction that came into force on January 6 and is being felt in pay packets this month, the main rate of national insurance was sliced by two percentage points, from 12% to 10%.

The Treasury says the change means a worker on a £35,000 salary will be £450 better off a year, although critics say the benefits are offset by the continuing freeze in personal tax thresholds, pulling millions into paying more to the Exchequer.

Ahead of a likely election later this year, Mr Hunt appears keen to cut taxes even further if he can, in a bid to boost the Conservative Party's chances of pulling off a shock victory.

Have you heard our new podcast Talking Politics? Every week Tom, Robert and Anushka dig into the biggest issues dominating the political agenda...

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's party has been consistently behind Sir Keir Starmer's Labour in opinion polls for more than a year, trailing by as much as 20 points in some surveys.

Speaking earlier this month during a visit to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the chancellor said ""the direction of travel"" is for the UK to emulate successful low-tax economies.

Economists have said the fact the government borrowed less than expected in December might give the Treasury chief the cover he needs to slash taxes further in the spring Budget.

Yet December's figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said debt levels are higher than they have been since the 1960s when compared with the size of the economy.

Responding to the IMF's briefing on Tuesday, Mr Hunt said it was ""too early to know whether further reductions in tax will be affordable in the Budget"".

He said it continued to be government thinking that ""smart tax reductions can make a big difference in boosting growth"".

Health minister Dame Andrea Leadsom, asked on LBC whether she wants to see further tax cuts, said it is the chancellor's ambition to ""enable people to keep more of their hard-earned cash"".

The IMF has downgraded the UK's growth forecast for next year, with the body's economists expecting UK growth to hit 0.6% this year, and 1.6% next.

Such a development would make the economy the second-worst performer in the G7 this year and the joint third-worst performer in 2025.

The IMF's forecast for this year is unchanged since its last report in October, but has been downgraded by 0.4 percentage points for next year.

However, the IMF said that change is largely due to a revision to official data, rather than a worsening economic situation.

Conservative former cabinet minister Sir David Davis told LBC's Andrew Marr that the IMF should ""go get lost"" over its tax warning.

""We should stop listening to financial forecasts that are based on the prejudices of the people who write them,"" he said.

The ex-Brexit secretary also predicted ""there'll be tax cuts, the question is the size"".","ITV News' Political Editor Robert Peston reports Jeremy Hunt has warned Cabinet there is less room for tax cuts in his March 6 Budget.

2024-02-01,Councils facing bankruptcy due to £4 billion black hole urge government to help | ITV News,"An 'out of control' crisis in local government funding can only be ended by the government providing billions of pounds more to councils, MPs have said.

Councils have repeatedly warned that more than a decade of financial pressures exacerbated by rising demand and inflation are putting vital public services under severe strain.

Applying pressure on ministers, a report by the Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Committee said additional council funding announced earlier this month was insufficient to address the scale of the problems.

A failure to increase allocations in the local government finance settlement to cover the shortfall would push services including social care and support for children with special educational needs to ""breaking point"", and could lead to well-run councils going effectively bust, the committee said.

Earlier this month, Communities Secretary Michael Gove increased the local government financial settlement for 2024/25 with measures worth an additional £600 million, including £500 million for adult and children's social care.

This increased available core funding by 7.5% compared to 2023/24, but the committee concluded this would not come close to addressing financial pressures across the sector, with the Local Government Association estimating councils face a funding gap of £4 billion over the next two years to continue services at current levels.

Clive Betts, Labour chair of the committee, said: ""There is an out-of-control financial crisis in local councils across England.

""The government must use the local government financial settlement to help bridge the £4 billion funding gap for 2024-25 or risk already strained council services becoming stretched to breaking point.

""If the government fails to plug this gap, well-run councils could face the very real prospect of effectively going bust.""

The committee reiterated it would take ""billions of pounds a year"" to put adult social care on a long-term secure footing and called for wholesale reform of the way councils are financed.

It said councils' core spending power, which is a combination of government grants and the maximum that can be raised through council tax and business rates, has not kept pace with growing pressures.

However, reductions in the funding provided directly by the government has led to councils relying increasingly on revenue generated locally.

The committee said council tax is ""regressive"", in need of reform and has a ""disproportionately negative impact on funding levels of local authorities in the most deprived areas of the country"".

The report highlighted that council tax charges are based on property valuations from 1991.

With prices rising considerably since then, this means people occupying the most valuable homes are paying less in council tax as a proportion of their property's value than those living in the least valuable properties, the committee said. There are also significant variations in the profile of properties in different areas.

This means authorities in wealthier parts of the country can generate significantly more revenue than those in less well-off places with higher levels of demand for expensive services, the report said.

The government also controls annual rises in council tax. In the last two years authorities must hold a local referendum if they wish to increase council tax beyond 5%. The committee said this approach is ""restricting local authorities' abilities to raise sufficient funding to fulfil their statutory responsibilities"".

The committee called for the revaluation of properties and the introduction of additional council tax bands.

It also said council tax thresholds should be increased in line with inflation. The committee described the business rates system as ""overly complex, outdated, and in need of reform"".

As there is variation in the amount different councils can generate through business rates, a formula is used to ensure some money is redistributed.

However, this process uses a baseline funding level calculated in 2013. Therefore, the committee concludes, the current process ""does not account for changes in population size, demographics, and associated demand for services in specific local authorities"".

Mr Betts said: ""Long-term reform is vitally needed. The funding model for local councils is broken.

""The business rates system is overly complex and in need of reform. Council tax is outdated and increasingly regressive.

""Councils being forced to hike up council tax, in a forlorn attempt to plug increasingly large holes in their budgets, is unsustainable and unfair to local people who are, year on year, seeing less services while paying more.""

A total of eight councils have issued a section 114 notice declaring effective bankruptcy in the last six years. No councils had done so in the proceeding eighteen years.

Responding to the report, Pete Marland, Labour chair of the LGA's Resources Board, said: ""The amount of funding available to councils is out of line with the requirements placed upon them.

""As well as needing to address this, any incoming government needs to give urgent attention to the entire system of funding local government to deliver vital local services, including reform and legislative change.""

A Department for Levelling Up, Housing & Communities spokesperson said: ""We recognise councils are facing challenges and that is why we recently announced an additional £600 million support package for councils across England, increasing their overall proposed funding for next year to £64.7 billion - a 7.5% increase in cash terms.

""This additional funding has been welcomed by leading local government organisations, but we remain ready to talk to any concerned council about its financial position.""","Councils have repeatedly warned that more than a decade of financial pressures are putting vital public services under severe strain.

2024-02-01,'You have blood on your hands': Tech companies questioned over child safety | ITV News,"Mark Zuckerberg has apologised to families over the harms of social media in a US hearing which lambasted the CEOs of online platforms for their role in child safety.

The bosses of Meta, TikTok, X and other social media companies testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.

In his opening remarks, South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham condemned the CEOs and said: ""You have blood on your hands.""

""You have a product that's killing people... You can't be sued, you should be!"" Senator Graham added.

The hearing began with recorded testimony from children and parents who said they or their children were exploited on social media. Throughout the event, parents who lost children to suicide silently held up pictures in their memory.

In a series of heated exchanges, the CEO's faced questioning over their personal responsibility to protect young people.

What did the CEOs say during the hearing?

Following a heated exchange, Mr Zuckerberg turned to apologise to the parents at the hearing, saying he was sorry for ""the things that your families have suffered"".

""I'm sorry for everything you have all been through. No one should go through the things that your families have suffered and this is why we invest so much and we are going to continue doing industry wide efforts to make sure no one has to go through the things your families have had to suffer,"" he said.

In response, Missouri Republican Senator Josh Hawley asked Mr Zuckerberg if he has personally compensated any of the victims and their families for what they have been through.

""I don't think so,"" Mr Zuckerberg replied.

Snapchat had broken ranks ahead of the hearing and began backing a federal bill that would create a legal liability for apps and social platforms who recommend harmful content to minors.

Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, who also took the opportunity to apologise to families, asked the industry to back the bill.

Meanwhile, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said the company is vigilant about enforcing its policy barring children under the age of 13 from using the app.

Linda Yaccarino CEO of X, formerly known as Twitter, said the site does not cater to children.

""We do not have a line of business dedicated to children,"" Ms Yaccarino said.

She added the company will also support the Stop CSAM Act - a federal bill that make it easier for victims of child exploitation to sue tech companies.

Why is the hearing happening?

The hearing comes as lawmakers across the world are growing increasingly concerned about the effects of social media on young people's lives.

Parents in particular claim that social media can hurt users under-18, including worries that it risks driving them to depression or even suicide.

In a rare show of agreement, both Republic and Democratic senators came together to interrogate the CEOs, with the future hope of passing legislation that moderates the companies.

In the UK, regulation is in place to protect children online. The government approved the Online Safety Bill last year, which aimed to introduce rules to social media and other user-generated content-based sites that compel them to remove illegal material from their platforms.

2024-02-01,Tearful Sturgeon tells Covid inquiry 'every death is a tragedy I regret' | ITV News,"The former Scottish first minister also insisted to the inquiry she did not carry out government business over WhatsApp as she admitted to deleting messages during the pandemic

Nicola Sturgeon choked back tears as she told the UK Covid inquiry the number of lives lost to the pandemic ""were far too high"" as she admitted she regrets ""every death"".

At several points during her first day giving evidence at the hearing in Edinburgh, Ms Sturgeon became visibly emotional as she admitted she wished she had not been the first minister when the pandemic struck and while she rebuffed accusations she politicised the pandemic.

During an intense day of grilling, the former Scottish first minister made some striking admissions, including that she deleted WhatsApp messages with government officials and that of her ""many regrets"", her biggest one was not locking the country down sooner.

But one member of the campaigning group, Scottish Covid Bereaved, said her ""crocodile tears aren't washing with me"", while the group's lawyer Aamer Anwar described her as a ""master of spin"".

'I feel to my core the number of lives lost were far too high'

Ms Sturgeon told the inquiry that ""for as long as I live I will carry the impact of these decisions"" made during the pandemic, as she apologised to all those who lost loved ones.

""I feel to my core that the number of lives lost to this pandemic were far too high. We were never going to be able to get through a pandemic with no loss of life,"" she said, becoming visibly emotional. ""I think it was far too high.

""I think the other impacts were far too high, and, you know, every death is a tragedy that I regret, and that people in this room and outside across the country are living with the grief and trauma of, so we didn't do as well as I wish we were able to.""

She added that of the ""many regrets"" she has, ""probably chief of those is that we didn't lock down a week, two weeks, earlier than we did.""

'Large part of me wishes I wasn't first minister'

Ms Sturgeon also admitted a ""large part"" of her wishes she was not first minister during the pandemic.

She said she did not believe Boris Johnson was the right prime minister for the job and became emotional when she was asked if she was the right first minister for it.

She said that despite what she thought about Mr Johnson at the start of pandemic she thought everyone was doing their best.

""I was the first minister when the pandemic struck. There's a large part of me wishes that I hadn't been but I was and I wanted to be the best first minister,"" she said, adding it was ""for others to judge"" if she succeeded in that aim.

Sturgeon admits deleting WhatsApp messages

In further admissions, Ms Sturgeon also said she deleted WhatsApp messages sent during the pandemic - and although it had become ""too common"" for the Scottish Government to use the app during that time period, she insisted it was not used to make formal decisions.

Earlier, she told the inquiry there was a ""high degree of formality around Scottish Government decision-making"" and she ""did not make extensive use of informal messaging and certainly did not use it [WhatsApp] to make decisions.""

She said she exchanged WhatsApps with no more than a ""handful"" of people, and was not a member of any groups, adding that now-First Minister Humza Yousaf, and her former chief of staff, Liz Lloyd, were the main people she communicated with in his way.

She said she deleted these informal messages, in line with official advice, and ""salient"" points were all recorded on the corporate record.

""I operated from 2007, based on advice, the policy that messages, business relating to government should not be kept on a phone that could be lost or stolen and insecure in that way, but properly recorded through the system,"" she said.

Ms Sturgeon conceded messages had not been retained on her own devices but said she has managed to retrieve copies to submit to the probe. She has said informal messages were handed over to the inquiry last year.

The former first minister said she had ""always assumed there would be a public inquiry"" and apologised for any lack of clarity at a public briefing where she said her WhatsApps would be handed over, despite knowing they had been deleted.

She maintained the Scottish Government was ""open, transparent and accountable"" throughout its pandemic response.

She replied: ""I have not said, and I'm not saying today, that I never used informal means of communication. What I am saying is that I did so very rarely and not to discuss issues of substance or anything that could be described as decision-making.""

Scottish Government ministers and officials have said decisions were routinely recorded on the official system even if messages were deleted in line with policy.

'Flaws and deficiencies' in care home guidance

Ms Sturgeon said she wishes she could ""turn back the clock"" to prevent the loss of lives in care homes due to Covid.

In the early months of the pandemic, more than 100 people were discharged from hospital to care homes after having previously tested positive for the virus and before returning a negative test.

She said: ""I do not think we got everything right around care homes and I deeply regret that.

""There were undoubtedly flaws and deficiencies in that guidance, but the advice at the time was isolation - keeping people as separate as possible - was the best way to protect people in care homes, and clearly that didn't have the effect that we wanted it to have.""

Politicising the pandemic?

Ms Sturgeon became emotional again later as she rebuffed previous accusations from UK minister Michael Gove that the Scottish Government used the pandemic to seek ""political conflict"", as she spoke of the toll Covid had on her in the early days.

She repeatedly denied politicising the pandemic in a bid to push for Scottish independence - and said if she had, it would have been a ""betrayal"".

Asked about Mr Gove's accusations, fighting back tears, she replied: ""The idea that in those horrendous days, weeks, I was thinking of political opportunity"" was ""not the case"".

""At times in those early days, I felt overwhelmed by the scale of what we were dealing with and perhaps more than anything, I felt an overwhelming responsibility to do the best I could,"" she added.

She said she had not thought ""less"" about politics and independence than she did during the pandemic.

Accusations exclusive 'gold command' meetings were not minuted

Ms Sturgeon also gave evidence on whether so-called ""gold command meetings"", which involve small groups of Scottish Cabinet members finalising key decisions during the pandemic, were not minuted.

She was asked whether this select group - which included herself, then-Health Secretary Mr Yousaf, former deputy first minister John Swinney and ex-finance secretary Kate Forbes - made decisions on their own.

Ms Sturgeon insisted she did not seek to exclude people and that the group was ""not a decision-making or a formal governance body"".

Asked about a text exchange between Mr Yousaf and national clinical director, Professor Jason Leitch, in which the latter says ""she actually wants none of us"" at certain meetings, Ms Sturgeon admitted she did ""not have a great deal of patience"" with the idea of ""everybody"" wanting to be in the room.

She added there was a ""tendency"" at one point where there were a ""cast of thousands"" who wanted to be there - but she wanted ""the right people"" with the ""right expertise"" present.

Nike conference decision would've been different with 'hindsight'

Ms Sturgeon also rejected accusations of ""secrecy"" within her government in the early days of the pandemic.

The Scottish Government became aware, the inquiry heard, that Covid-19 was something to ""be very worried about"" in late January 2020, with the Cabinet discussing the virus for the first time on February 4.

In his evidence to the inquiry, epidemiologist Professor Mark Woolhouse criticised the Scottish Government for failing to disclose a Covid outbreak at a Nike conference.

The three-day Nike conference took place towards the end of February 2020 at the Hilton Carlton Hotel, with about 25 people later believed to have been infected with Covid-19. Details of the incident only emerged in a BBC documentary in May.

The inquiry heard former chief medical officer (CMO), Dr Catherine Calderwood - who later resigned after it emerged she made a Covid rule-breaking trip to her holiday home in Fife - had advised the Scottish Government the outbreak should not be disclosed to the public on grounds of patient confidentiality.

However, with hindsight, Ms Sturgeon said she would have ""gone the other way"" on the disclosure of the Nike conference.","Nicola Sturgeon admitted to deleting WhatsApp messages during the pandemic.

2024-02-01,"'Grave concerns' for 16,000 animals stuck on ship over Red Sea attack fears | ITV News","Animal rights groups are ""gravely concerned"" for thousands of sheep and cattle stranded in an Israeli-owned ship off the coast of Australia, due to fears over the Houthi Red Sea attacks.

More than 16,000 animals are stuck aboard the MV Bahijah in waters off Western Australia, and have been on the ship since January 5.

The live exports were meant to be transported to the Middle East, but 15 days into their journey, Australian authorities ordered the ship to turn around.

Its order came due to fears the ship could be attacked by Houthis in the Red Sea - as the group has been targeting Israeli and Western ally vessels.

But with sweltering temperatures of up to 40 degrees, the animals getting increasingly larger and campaigners warning ""it's only a matter of time"" before disease spreads through the herd, there are fears for the animal's welfare.

Suzanne Fowler, Chief Science Officer if the RSPCA said it's a matter of urgency that all animals are taken off the boat.

Dr Fowler said: ""The welfare of the animals is only going to get worse and worse over the coming days due to the amount of time they've spent on the ship. So, it's very urgent and we couldn't be more gravely concerned.

""The stress of the animals is only going to yield in the coming days and that sense of fatigue where they can't cope anymore, will only worsen.

""A lot of these diseases you won't see until it's too late.""

Earlier this week, the Australian government said it was working with the exporter on a plan, but by Thursday it was still considering a request from the exporter to allow the ship to leave.

The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry said the vessel came into Fremantle Port, near Perth, the statement said.

No livestock were offloaded and two independent vets inspected the animals on Wednesday and found ""no significant animal health or welfare issues,"" the government said.

John Hassell, president of the Western Australian Farmers Federation (WAFarmers), which represents the state's agricultural industry, said a decision should have been made days ago.

He told CNN: ""If the animals are in good nick, if there's no disease if there's plenty of space, we'll (resupply the ship) and turn it away... it should have been gone by now.""

Mr Hassell said he'd been sent photos from the ship that show the animals in good condition, contrary to concerns that conditions are deteriorating.

""I'm comfortable that the sheep are in the shade sitting down, chewing their cud in the warm parts of the day and eating when it's cooler, like they do on the farm,"" Mr Hassell said.

Australia's live export industry has long been a point of contention with animal rights activists in the country.

The government has pledged to end the live export of sheep but has not confirmed when.

In Australia, sheep, cattle and buffalo are exported by sea for meat or breeding, with some animals being on the vessels for up to five weeks, if not longer when things go wrong.

Typically, voyages to South East Asia are five to seven days, its two to three weeks for the Middle East, and a month to Russia and China, according to campaigners Stop Live Exports.","Animal rights groups are ""gravely concerned"" for thousands of sheep and cattle stranded in an Israeli-owned ship off the coast of Australia.

2024-02-01,Russia and Ukraine complete prisoner swap despite tensions over plane crash | ITV News,"The development comes despite tensions stemming from last week's crash of a military transport plane, which Moscow claimed was carrying 65 Ukrainian PoWs and was shot down by Kyiv's forces.

After the plane crash in Russia's Belgorod region, near the border with Ukraine, some Russian officials had publicly questioned the possibility of future PoW swaps.

Russia's Defence Ministry said the countries exchanged 195 PoWs each.

After the statement was released, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said 207 Ukrainians were freed.

There was no immediate explanation for the different figures.

""We remember each Ukrainian in captivity. Both warriors and civilians. We must bring all of them back. We are working on it,"" Zelenskyy said on X, formerly Twitter.

Dmytro Lubinets, Ukraine's ombudsman for human rights, said on social media that it was the 50th such exchange since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion nearly two years ago, with a total of 3,035 PoWs repatriated.

Among the Ukrainians released were members of the armed forces, National Guard, Border Service and national police, said Andrii Yermak, head of Ukraine's Presidential Office.

He added that some of them had been captured while defending Mariupol, Azovstal, and Snake Island.

The Russian military said, without providing details or evidence, that the Russian PoWs who were swapped on Wednesday ""faced deadly danger in captivity"" and will be flown to Moscow for treatment and rehabilitation.

Ukrainian officials confirmed that a swap was due to take place the day the plane crashed on January 24, and was called off, but said they have seen no evidence the plane was carrying the PoWs.","Russia's Defence Ministry says the countries exchanged 195 PoWs each.

2024-02-01,Why TikTok users may no longer hear music by artists like Taylor Swift and Adele | ITV News,"Music by artists such as Taylor Swift, Harry Styles and Adele could be pulled from TikTok after a breakdown in talks between Universal Music Group and the social media platform over royalties, Rishi Davda explains

Taylor Swift, Harry Styles, and Adele might be about to see their discography wiped off TikTok after the platform failed to find an agreement with the Universal Music Group over issues including artist compensation and AI.

Some of the app's biggest hits, including by The Beatles, Drake, and Ariana Grande, will also be removed from TikTok's music library as their initial deal with UMG is set to expire in the next 24 hours.

The social media app, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, allows users to post short videos with effects and music. It has boomed in popularity over the last five years and has 1.1 billion active accounts across 160 countries, according to data from DemandSage.

On Tuesday, UMG published an open letter titled, ""Why we must call Time Out on TikTok"", in which they accuse TikTok of attempting to ""bully"" and ""intimidate"" them into ""accepting a deal worth less than the previous deal, far less than fair market value and not reflective of their exponential growth"".

The letter said that TikTok accounts for only about 1% of UMG's total revenue - ""an indication of how little TikTok compensates artists and songwriters, despite its massive and growing user base, rapidly rising advertising revenue and increasing reliance on music-based content"".

""Ultimately TikTok is trying to build a music-based business, without paying fair value for the music,"" it continued.

""How did it try to intimidate us? By selectively removing the music of certain of our developing artists, while keeping on the platform our audience-driving global stars.

""TikTok's tactics are obvious: use its platform power to hurt vulnerable artists and try to intimidate us into conceding to a bad deal that undervalues music and shortchanges artists and songwriters as well as their fans.""

UMG also touched on a lack of ""no meaningful solutions"" to the ""tidal wave of hate speech, bigotry, bullying and harassment on the platform.""

""The only means available to seek the removal of infringing or problematic content (such as pornographic deepfakes of artists) is through the monumentally cumbersome and inefficient process which equates to the digital equivalent of 'Whack-a-Mole.'""

Only last week, complaints erupted across the internet over regulation of social media platforms and content generated by AI after explicit fake photographs of Taylor Swift were circulated online.

UMG is one of the industry's most dominant music companies, holding the rights to music by artists including Elton John, Kendrick Lamar, Justin Bieber, U2, Coldplay, Bob Dylan, and more.

If UMG and TikTok fail to come to an agreement, all of these songs will be removed from the service as the deal expires on Wednesday, a UMG spokesperson said.

In a short response, TikTok said it is ""sad and disappointing"" that UMG ""has put their own greed above the interests of their artists and songwriters"".

In a statement, the social media platform said: ""Despite Universal's false narrative and rhetoric, the fact is they have chosen to walk away from the powerful support of a platform with well over a billion users that serves as a free promotional and discovery vehicle for their talent.

""TikTok has been able to reach 'artist-first' agreements with every other label and publisher.

""Clearly, Universal's self-serving actions are not in the best interests of artists, songwriters and fans.""

2024-02-01,"Post Office branches closing because of distrust in its IT systems, MP claims | ITV News","Residents in the Llŷn Peninsula's second largest town are set to remain without a Post Office because prospective owners have been frightened off by the Horizon scandal, an MP has claimed.

Nefyn in Gwynedd lost its Post Office four months ago because staff no longer trusted its computer system, according to Liz Saville Roberts MP.

The Dwyfor Meirionnydd MP claimed that ""countless communities"" could be facing a similar fate, with interest in taking over the service waning following recent negative publicity.

Mrs Saville Roberts said she understood that some of the parties interested in taking over Nefyn Post Office pulled out as a direct result of the ongoing scandal.

A Post Office spokesperson said it will do all it can to ""support postmasters and drive footfall to their branches.""

Between 1999 and 2015, more than 700 branch managers were prosecuted by the Post Office for theft, false accounting, and fraud after faulty Horizon accounting software made it look as though money was missing from their branches.

The government has pledged to bring in a new law to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate"" those falsely convicted.

But hundreds of subpostmasters and subpostmistresses are still awaiting compensation despite the government announcing that those who have had convictions quashed are eligible for £600,000 payouts.

A statutory inquiry into the saga is underway and there was renewed public anger following its dramatisation in ITV's Mr Bates vs The Post Office earlier this month.

Nefyn, which has seen a rise in holiday home numbers, has a shrinking year-round population, down 79 to 1,294 residents in the 10 years to the 2021 census. Speaking in the House of Commons, the Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts said: ""The effects of the Horizon scandal and Post Office business practices are still hurting our communities.

""The Post Office in Nefyn closed partly because staff no longer trust the computer systems, which I bet is happening in countless communities.""Post Office Minister Kevin Hollinrake has now offered to meet the MP to discuss the situation.Residents say they now face a 14-mile round-trip to reach the nearest alternative branch in Y Ffôr.

Veteran angler and countryman Noel Hulmston said local businesses and elderly residents in particular were suffering the consequences.

He said: ""Some people, especially those without cars, are now seriously disadvantaged when it comes to collecting pensions, buying stamps and so on.""Mr Hulmston continued: ""We have just two ATMs in Nefyn but these charge £1.25 to take out cash. In contrast, ATMs are free to use in Pwllheli, which makes you wonder if operators are taking advantage of Nefyn's circumstances.""

""The way things are going, subpostmasters are a dying breed despite what Parliament says.""UK government criteria stipulate that the Post Office must maintain 11,500 branches nationwide and that 99% of the population must be within three miles of one.

Mr Hollinrake told the Commons the Post Office was currently meeting this criteria.Nefyn's stand-alone Post Office closed several years ago when its husband-and-wife team retired.

The service was taken on by the town's Spar shop with a promise of longer hours and more flexibility, according to Mr Hulmston.

Following its closure, and the loss of prospective operators, Mrs Saville Roberts has been pushing for a mobile post office in the seaside townShe told the Commons: ""Last week, the Post Office said no. Will the minister guarantee the people of Nefyn that this, the oldest and second largest town in Llŷn, will again have post services in the town?""Responding, Mr Hollinrake promised to take up her concerns and look into the matter. He insisted customers themselves should have no concerns when using Post Office services.

He said: ""It is very important that our citizens - our consumers - have confidence in the Post Office.""The Horizon system is being replaced. As far as I know, there has never been a case of a customer losing out because of the Horizon system.""The issue of Nefyn's Post Office closure was also raised in the Senedd on Tuesday.

Plaid Cymru MS for Dwyfor Meirionydd, Mabon ap Gwynfor, said: ""It closed, partly, because of a loss of confidence in the IT systems, and I'm led to believe that other communities are experiencing similar responses too.""

The Post Office said it was in touch with Ms Saville Roberts about the issue and that its branch network in Wales is now relatively stable.

A Post Office spokesperson said: ""Nefyn Post Office closed last September and despite initial interest in taking on the branch, we don't currently have an applicant. Tudweiliog Post Office is located nearby. It is reachable by public transport and is presently open six mornings a week.""The recent ITV drama movingly depicted a shameful period in the Post Office's history. Nevertheless, we welcome it and its effect in encouraging victims of the Horizon IT scandal to come forward; and in precipitating justice for all those who have been wronged.

""We will continue to do all we can to support Postmasters and drive footfall to their branches in order to improve their remuneration at the end of each month.""","Nefyn in Gwynedd lost its Post Office four months ago because staff no longer trusted its computer system. Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts said ""countless communities"" could be facing a similar fate.

2024-02-01,What are the new UK visa immigration rules coming into effect in weeks? | ITV News,"A raft of new, stricter UK immigration rules will come into force within a matter of weeks.

The changes, announced by Home Secretary James Cleverly in December, will be gradually introduced from March, the Home Office has confirmed.

In a bid to cut the number of people legally arriving in Britain, the government is making it more difficult for overseas care workers and those on family and skilled worker visas to move to the UK.

And those who pay to use the NHS - which includes most visa applicants - will soon have to pay more than double per year to do so.

The changes were announced in the wake of revised official estimates from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which showed net migration - the difference between the number of people arriving and leaving the country - peaking at a record high of 745,000 in 2022.

Following pressure from Tory MPs, the home secretary said the rule changes will help give the ""biggest ever reduction in net migration"", and, along with earlier proposals to limit relatives of foreign students, would bring down levels by 300,000 a year.

ITV News breaks down everything you need to know about the law changes and when they will come into effect.

The immigration health surcharge (IHS) will rise by 66% for those applying to come to or stay in the UK on or after February 6.

The standard rate will rise from £624 to £1,035 per year.

A reduced rate that applies to visas for students - those under 18 and young adults on a youth mobility scheme - is set to rise by 65% from £470 to £776 per year.

The healthcare surcharge has to be paid by most visa or immigration applicants who are staying in the UK for more than six months.

Essentially, it is a payment to use the NHS for the duration of a person's visa entitlement. However, it does not cover all health services, such as dental treatment, eye tests and prescriptions.

Critics of the IHS argue those who are working in the UK are already contributing to the NHS through the taxes they pay every month - with some having contributed for years already.

But legal migration minister Tom Pursglove said people coming to the UK on visas should make a ""sufficient financial contribution"" towards the cost of services, including the NHS.

March

From March 11, changes will come into effect that restrict overseas care workers from bringing dependants to the UK.

Care providers will also have to register with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) if they are sponsoring migrants.

The changes have raised concerns about how key roles, such as care workers, will be filled if overseas workers are either prevented or dissuaded from coming to the UK.

Minister of State for Social Care Helen Whately said: ""We're grateful to overseas care workers but I'm clear that immigration is not the long-term answer to our social care needs.

""That's why alongside tightening visa rules we're reforming social care careers to boost our homegrown care workforce.""

The Home Office said the measures will ""help curb the abuse of the health and care visa route, where we have seen people come to the UK for care worker jobs that do not exist or are paid significantly less than the required salary for a migrant worker on this route, and ensure British labour is not undercut by overseas workers"".

From April 4, the minimum salary required for people coming to the UK on skilled worker visas will rise - increasing from £26,200 to £38,700.

Currently, visa applicants whose job is listed on the shortage occupation list pay a lower application fee.

The move will also see changes to the Shortage Occupation List (SOL), which is used to identify jobs where overseas workers need to be hired to fill vacancies.

If an applicant's job is on the list, they can qualify for a skilled worker visa. Such jobs have a lower salary threshold and applicants can be paid 80% of the usual going rate for that job.

However, from March 14, the government will remove the 20% going rate discount for occupations on the shortage occupation list. From early April, this list will be abolished in favour of a new ""immigration salary list"", which will act on recommendations made by the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC).

The body will initially advise government on which occupations should be temporarily added to the immigration salary list in time for March.

The rule change that drew the most criticism was the hike in the minimum income requirement for family visas.

In order to be approved for a family visa, applicants must prove they and their partner have a combined income above a certain threshold. However, the minimum requirement increases if they are also applying for children or dependants.

From April 11, the requirement will rise to £29,000 per year and will come into effect on April 11.

By early next year, the minimum requirement will increase to £38,700.

Initially, the home secretary had said the minimum threshold would increase from £18,600 to £38,700 - more than a £20,000 jump.

But following backlash, the government confirmed it will make the increase in stages to give predictability to families - something that has been criticised by right-wing Tory MPs in favour of tighter migration controls.

Chairman of the Migration Advisory Committee Professor Brian Bell previously said raising the income threshold for family visas would not be a ""major player in reducing net migration"".

Have you heard our new podcast Talking Politics? Every week Tom, Robert and Anushka dig into the biggest issues dominating the political agenda...

Following the announcement of the rule change dates, the home secretary said the ""robust measures"" come as part of a ""firm approach, but a fair one"", and give people ""time to prepare whilst ensuring that migration comes down"".

Mr Celeverly said migration is ""too high"", adding: ""We must get back to sustainable levels.""

""The British people want to see action, not words. We are delivering the change we promised and which they expect, lifting pressure on public services and protecting British workers with the utmost urgency.""

Meanwhile, migrant support charity Praxis warned thousands of people could fall ""deeper into poverty and insecurity"" by hiking the immigration health surcharge ""well above inflation"", as it accused the government of treating people born outside the UK as ""cash cows"".

Praxis policy and public affairs manager Josephine Whitaker-Yilmaz added: ""Every day we see people already struggling to afford bills and food while they try and save the thousands needed for these fees, especially as the cost-of-living crisis drags on.""

In a written statement on Tuesday, legal migration minister Mr Pursglove said: ""The new rate reflects the increases in healthcare expenditure and better reflects NHS service use by payers, remembering that payment of the charge provides near comprehensive access to our health service.

""The level of IHS will be kept under regular review to ensure it covers the cost of treating IHS payers.""","Immigration health surcharge (IHS) will rise by 66% for those applying to come to or stay in the UK on or after February 6.

A mum and her two children are in hospital after an attacker threw a corrosive substance at them in south London.

The mother cried, ""I can't see, I can't see"" a witness who ran to help her, told the BBC.

Three onlookers, who rushed to help the victims, and three police officers were also injured in what police described as a ""horrific incident"" at around 7.25pm on Wednesday evening.

A man was spotted fleeing the scene, in Lessar Avenue near Clapham Common, and is still on the run.

Officers from the Metropolitan Police are working to track him down. A police helicopter has been deployed in the manhunt.

On Thursday morning the road is blocked off by police. A white car with the doors still open remained in the middle of the road until this morning, until officers removed it.

Forensics also remain at the scene.

""There has been a traffic collision with a man assaulting occupants in a car and throwing acid. Victims include children,"" Marina Ahmad, Labour's London Assembly member for Lambeth & Southwark, posted on X, formerly known as Twitter on Wednesday night

Police have not said anything about a car crash or how the attack happened. Detective Superintendent Alexander Castle said: ""Officers are on scene following this horrific incident.

""While tests are ongoing to determine what the substance is, at this stage we believe it to be a corrosive substance.

""A man was seen fleeing the scene. We are drawing on resources from across the Met to apprehend this individual and work is ongoing to determine what has led to this awful incident.

2024-02-01,UK needs tax rises not cuts as IMF brands Hunt's spending plans unrealistic | ITV News,"The IMF brands Hunt's spending plans 'unrealistic', as ITV News Economics Editor Joel Hills explains

Countries don't usually go bust, they get bailed out.

And when it comes to resources, reach and authority, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is the organisation that acts as global lender of last resort.

The IMF's job is to disperse emergency loans to nations in financial distress.

It also attempts to prevent governments from getting into trouble in the first place but its advice isn't always welcome.

The latest installment of the IMF's World Economic Outlook - its assessment of the prospects for the world economy - will not be going down well in Downing Street.

The IMF has downgraded its forecast for economic growth in the UK next year and cautions Rishi Sunak's government against tax cuts.

Indeed, the IMF suggests there's a strong case for putting taxes up, given that, it believes the pressures on the public finances in Britain will only increase in the years ahead.

IMF advises against further tax cuts after downgrading its forecast for economic growth in the UK

An IMF spokesperson said: ""Preserving high-quality public services and undertaking critical public investments to boost growth and achieve the net zero targets, will imply higher spending needs over the medium term than are currently reflected in the government's budget plans.

""Accommodating these needs, while assuredly stabilising the debt/GDP ratio, will already require generating additional high-quality fiscal savings, including on the tax side.""

The statement goes on to suggest that hiking property or wealth taxes in the UK and/or ditching the triple lock on pensions might be a good idea before adding: ""It is in this context that staff advises against further tax cuts"".

The IMF's language may seem alien and mysterious but it reads, in economist-speak, as an authoritative challenge to the government's economic strategy. The timing - five weeks away from the Budget - is incredibly inconvenient for the chancellor.

Earlier this month Jeremy Hunt told ITV News that his priority in the Budget would be to cut taxes and that doing so would revive our economic prospects.

'If I can, I would like to reduce the tax burden,' the chancellor said

""I look at the numbers around the world,"" Mr Hunt said. ""And I see that places like America and countries in Asia that have lower taxes have more dynamic economies and grow faster. And that's what I would like us to be.""

The IMF is rarely explicitly critical of wealthy advanced economies and is often useful ally.

In 2010, the Cameron-Clegg coalition government pursued its programme of austerity (spending cuts and tax rises) with the IMF's public backing, initially at least.

In September 2022, the IMF warned Liz Truss's government that her proposals for unfunded tax cuts were ill-advised and risked pushing up prices and fuelling inflation.

It would be wrong to suggest the IMF's intervention brought Liz Truss down but it did contribute to the erosion of her credibility.

Mr Hunt has been under pressure to cut taxes from MPs within his party for some time and the temptation to do so in an election year will be strong - not least as the latest opinion polls suggest the Conservatives face the prospect of an emphatic defeat.

Have you heard our new podcast Talking Politics? Every week Tom, Robert and Anushka dig into the biggest issues dominating the political agenda...

The ""tax burden"" in the UK (the amount of tax we pay as a share of national income) is on course to reach a post-war high of 38% of GDP, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility.

Since 2020, the government has spent billions of pounds supporting British households and businesses through both the lockdown imposed during the pandemic and the wave of inflation triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It has done so using borrowed money.

The nation's stock of debt is rising, the cost of servicing it has increased (in line with inflation and interest rates) and the outlook for economic growth (and with it tax revenues) is weak.

Nevertheless, the chancellor reduced the main rate of national insurance by 2 percentage points in January and has signalled there's more to come.

In recent months, the headline rate of inflation has faded and markets have begun to bet that the Bank of England will soon think about cutting interest rates.

In theory, Mr Hunt's self-imposed ""borrowing rules"" (which include a target of cutting debt as a share of GDP in five years' time) mean that there is some scope for giveaways in his Budget.

But the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that any taxes cuts ahead of a general election are likely to prove temporary, not least because the government's current spending plans are, in its view, unrealistic.

Last week, the IFS estimated that ""unprotected"" government departments face a funding shortfall of £20 billion a year from 2024/25 onwards.

The IMF shares the belief that the reduction in expenditure on public services is ""very challenging"" - so much so that the IMF assumes it will not happen.

""January's tax cuts were essentially paid for by a squeeze on future public service spending plans which might not be delivered,"" says Carl Emerson of the IFS, in response to the IMF's comments.

""And government debt is forecast to remain elevated for the next few years. The economic case for further tax cuts prior to a detailed spending review is therefore weak to say the least.""

Responding to the IMF's comments, Mr Hunt said: ""The IMF expect growth to strengthen over the next few years, supported by our introduction of the biggest capital investment tax reliefs anywhere in the world, alongside National Insurance cuts to improve work incentives.

""It is too early to know whether further reductions in tax will be affordable in the Budget, but we continue to believe that smart tax reductions can make a big difference in boosting growth.""",IMF downgrades its forecast for economic growth in the UK next year.

The Hello singer will perform in Munich at what she described as a ""one off, bespoke pop-up stadium"" in the German city, she announced on her social media on Wednesday morning.

She piqued fans' interest on Tuesday by posting a video of a compilation of pictures of herself in black and white.

Many people were left speculating whether this was new music or a tour.

Ticket Master released footage of Adele's Las Vegas residency to promote her Munich shows

In a lengthy message to her fans, Adele revealed she ""was too curious to not follow up"" on the idea of four nights in Germany.

She said: ""A one off, bespoke pop-up stadium designed around whatever show I want to put on? Ohh!?

""Pretty much slap bang in the middle of Europe? In Munich? That's a bit random, but still fabulous!

""Right after the Euros? Come on England! With the Olympics next door? Go on Simone! And some of my favourite artists playing shows too? Why...YES!! I haven't played in Europe since 2016!

""I couldn't think of a more wonderful way to spend my summer and end this beautiful phase of my life and career with shows closer to home during such an exciting summer.

""Guten Tag babes x""

A CGI mock up of the open air stadium shows a huge arena with Adele emblazoned across the outside.

The shows, at Munich Messe, will take place on August 2, 3, 9 and 10 and will feature a combination of seated grandstands and standing areas with capacity for 80,000 people a night.

She is currently performing the last leg of her Las Vegas residency, Weekends With Adele, which runs until mid-June.

Adele last played in the UK in July 2022 at the British Summer Time festival in Hyde Park.

2024-02-01,How AI and Augmented reality are powering the fighter jet of the future | ITV News,"Health and Science Correspondent Martin Stew was given access to trial the equipment used in the design of the newest RAF fighter jet

In 1986, mobile phones were bricks and home PCs were run on floppy disks. It's also the year that design started on Typhoon - the jet fighter which is still the workhorse of the Royal Air Force (RAF).

Whilst Typhoon has evolved, technology has changed and so have international threats.

So, how do you design a new stealth fighter jet which will see us through most of the rest of this century?

That's the challenge designers from BAE Systems, based in Preston, are working on. They're designing Typhoon's replacement, called Tempest, which should be ready by 2035.

I was given exclusive access to try some of the new kit they're testing.

""This aircraft will be in service for 50 years,"" Paul Wilde, Head of Tempest, BAE Systems told me.

""Therefore it still needs to be able to keep up with the technologies that haven't even been invented yet. So things like artificial intelligence, machine learning, they're all things that will be fundamental to it developing and evolving through its life.""

Want a quick and expert briefing on the biggest news stories? Listen to our latest podcasts to find out What You Need To Know...

Tempest will be as much a super computer as a super sonic jet. The pilot no longer a 'bus driver', but a conductor of an orchestra, controlling not just their plane, but a suite of drones operated by the same system.

For legal and tactical reasons the RAF still wants to have manned aircraft in the skies. The technology is so advanced and quantities of data so great that designers are having to learn how not to overload pilots.

Some of the help can be found from computer games.

Graduate apprentice Tilly Watts showed me how 'haptic' vests are being trialled to send warning vibrations to pilots if they need to be alerted to a threat.

The cockpit is also being redesigned to use augmented reality, where graphics are mapped directly onto the landscape like a virtual reality sat nav.

Tempest is a joint venture sharing costs and expertise with Japan and Italy.

Predecessor Typhoon was criticised for being slow to develop and expensive - spiral costs saw the Ministry of Defence reduce orders by 30%.

By letting autonomous drones and robots do the heavy lifting at their factory in Preston designers hope to work faster and cheaper.

Test Pilot Glyn Gogerty also explained that artificial intelligence (AI) analysis of data and feedback from simulator tests has rapidly sped up design.

""So the benefits of the simulation are that we can do all the testing much earlier, so that by the time we get to manufacturing the aircraft, we've got models that work and we have an aircraft that flies really well before we even get to the stage of manufacturing it.

""That saves a lot of time and a lot of cost in manufacturing.""

The bill is already heading towards billions, with defence budgets stretched. Tempest will have to prove its money well spent.","Martin Stew was given exclusive access to trial the equipment used in the design of the newest RAF fighter jet.

2024-02-01,The seven illnesses patients can now get treatment for without seeing a GP | ITV News,"People are being urged to visit their pharmacy for seven common conditions, to free up millions of GP appointments, but there are concerns the plans won't work, Rebecca Barry reports

Patients can now get treatment for seven common conditions without needing to see a GP under a shake-up of pharmacy services.

From Wednesday, thousands of pharmacists across England will be able to assess and treat people without a prescription.

NHS England said more than nine in 10 community pharmacies in England - 10,265 in total - will be offering the checks under the Pharmacy First scheme.

The move is intended to give people more places to get the care they need, freeing up 10 million GP appointments a year.

Here, ITV News explains which conditions are included under the scheme and how to recognise them.

Sinusitis

Sinusitis is swelling of the sinuses, usually caused by an infection. It often clears up on its own within two to three weeks, but medicines can help if it's taking a long time to go away.

Sore throats are very common and usually get better by themselves within a week. They are usually caused by viruses (like cold or flu) or from smoking.

Earache can be painful, but is not usually a sign of anything serious.

How long ear pain lasts depends on what caused it. Some of the most common causes teething in young children, earwax build-up, glue ear, perforated eardrum, sore throat, tonsillitis, ear infection and a cold or flu.

Infected insect bites

Insect bites or stings are not usually serious and get better in a few days, but sometimes they can become infected or cause an allergic reaction.

Impetigo

Impetigo is a skin infection that's very contagious, but not usually serious.

It should begin to clear within seven to 10 days with treatment and symptoms of impetigo include:

Shingles

Shingles is an infection that causes a painful rash, usually appearing as blotches on the skin.

The first symptoms of shingles include:

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women under 65

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) affect your urinary tract, including your bladder, urethra or kidneys.

Symptoms of a UTI include:

2024-02-01,Post Office campaigner Alan Bates to reject 'offensive' compensation offer | ITV News,"One of the leading Post Office Horizon scandal campaigners has said he will reject an offer of compensation from the government, which he says is ""around a sixth"" of what he asked for.

Alan Bates, whose two-decade fight inspired the ITV series Mr Bates vs The Post Office, told The Daily Telegraph the offer was ""offensive"" and ""cruel"".

The government confirmed plans for ""full and fair compensation"" to those affected by the IT scandal in 2022, which between 1999 and 2015 saw more than 700 staff members wrongly prosecuted of theft, false accounting and fraud due to faulty accounting software called Horizon.

""'Full and fair' might be His Majesty's Government's interpretation, but in reality, the offer is derisory, offensive and after all this time, yes, cruel. I will absolutely be turning this offer for financial redress down.

""It's just a terrible way to treat human beings - and I have heard from several sub-postmasters who have received similarly derisory offers, while others are still waiting.""

He said the offer had been made on Wednesday, 111 days after his claim - prepared with the help of forensic accountants engaged by his lawyers - had been submitted.

""I have been in the queue along with all the others in the scheme, but if my case is an example of the way they are going to treat all cases, we may as well start looking at a legal action again and let the judiciary decide.""

Mr Bates was among more than 500 people who received an average of about £20,000 after a High Court ruling in 2019.

A government spokesman told the Telegraph: ""If any applicant to the GLO (Group Litigation Order) scheme feels that they are owed more than is being offered, we are happy to discuss the evidence with their legal advisers.

""If we can't agree, decisions will be made by an independent panel that includes legal and accountancy experts, who ensure fair redress based on the evidence.""","Alan Bates says he will reject an offer of compensation from the government.

As an agreement rejectionist, Sir Jeffrey eventually resigned from the Ulster Unionists in December 2003 and joined the DUP.

Twenty years later, things have come full circle. Sir Jeffrey has said yes to the restoration of power-sharing at Stormont and he has come out fighting.

He has talked about being ""on the front foot"" and knows the importance of that all too well.

After signing the historic peace agreement in 1998, Mr Trimble often appeared defensive and on the back foot.

The Ulster Unionists are widely regarded as having done a poor job as they tried to justify their decision to sign the agreement, ahead of the referendum that saw the people of Northern Ireland ratify the peace deal on May 22 1998.

As an anti-agreement unionist back then, Sir Jeffrey was perhaps glad to see Mr Trimble do a sub-standard job as salesman.

His public statements over the last few days suggest he has no intention of making the same mistake.

Having once been a poacher, he might prove to be a good gamekeeper.","Sir Jeffrey Donaldson was once a 'naysayer', opposed to the Good Friday Agreement.

2024-02-01,Welsh education in 'crisis' as fears mount that reforms will only make it worse | ITV News,"Classrooms in Wales are in a 'crisis' as exam results fall to faster than any other UK nation, and while reforms are coming into place, experts fear they will only further disadvantage children

Wales's Education Minister (and First Ministerial candidate) Jeremy Miles has announced plans to improve attainment and record breaking levels of school absences.

The minister is trying to turn Wales's flagging education system around, after pupils recorded the country's worst ever Pisa results last month - when results plummeted faster than in any other UK nation.

The minister told journalists he's confident results will improve, but experts have told ITV News that Wales's education system is in crisis, with fears the government's controversial new curriculum will make things worse - particularly for the poorest children.

An exclusive survey of teachers for ITV News found that more than eight in ten say they don't have enough support and that the new curriculum isn't raising standards.

How well children do at school is often closely linked to how affluent their parents are. As the poorest nation in the UK, it's no surprise then that Welsh children routinely score badly in international tests like Pisa, but this malaise runs deeper.

In last month's tests, the most affluent pupils in Wales had similar scores in reading and mathematics to the average in England.

A 2022 study also found that the difference in results between Welsh pupils from poorer households and their peers at age 16 was greater than in England as a whole, as well as in even more deprived parts of England.

To try and tackle this longstanding ""disadvantage gap"", the Welsh government announced a radical overhaul of the Welsh Education system in 2015.

It was described by the then education minister as ""the biggest shake up to education since 1944"" and ""very different from what we are seeing happening over the border in England"".

The new Curriculum for Wales, rolled out since 2019, involves giving schools more autonomy over what they teach and assess, with the responsibility of designing and implementing it transferred from civil servants to teachers. Its emphasis is on skills and pupil wellbeing, rather than the procurement of specific knowledge.

While there has been praise for the freedom this offers teachers, many fear it will lead to inconsistency between schools, and have warned similar systems has failed elsewhere.

A study of the early rollout by Cardiff University warned that ""far from reducing educational inequalities, the new Curriculum for Wales may actually exacerbate them"".

One of the authors, Dr Nigel Newton, told ITV News there was ""no evidence"" their concerns had been addressed by the Welsh government.

Wales's new curriculum is very similar to that implemented more than a decade ago in Scotland, which was recently criticised by Lindsay Paterson, emeritus professor of education policy at the University of Edinburgh as ""badly thought-out"", and an ""inescapable culprit"" in the ""severe decline"" of Scotland's recent PISA results.

Similar curricula in Finland, New Zealand and Australia also saw declines in results which subsequently led to reform.

Educationalists agree that curricula like these often require more resources to succeed, but the Welsh government has overseen successive real term cuts to the education budget. Last week 87% of headteachers in Wales warned they would need to cut their budgets next year.

Asked today whether international results have given the minister pause for thought over the new curriculum, the minister told ITV News he was confident it was part of the answer to improving standards.

""The reform programme that we have is, yes about the curriculum, but about a range of other reforms as well including around school improvement and teaching. And those reforms have actually been designed together with the OECD which is the organisation which runs the Pisa tests.""

The minister cited New Zealand and Canada as countries who have been successful after undergoing similar curriculum reforms, however, both countries have seen a consistent decline in their Pisa scores over the past decade.

Asked whether he had read the report by Cardiff University warning that the new curriculum could worsen the attainment gap, the minister didn't respond.

The Welsh government is clearly totally committed to its new curriculum, but as international evidence emerges that similar systems are failing, many fear that the government may have backed the wrong horse.",Education Minister Jeremy Miles is trying to turn Wales's flagging education system around.

2024-02-01,Government publishes deal to restore Stormont | ITV News,"The UK Government has published the deal between it and the Democratic Unionist Party on post-Brexit checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland which put power sharing in storage for the past two years.

Legislation is expected to pass on Thursday with preparations underway to have an Assembly sitting as early as Friday or Saturday.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said ""significant steps"" had been taken by the DUP to endorse the deal. During Prime Minister's Questions he also thanked the other parties for their patience during his government's negotiations with the DUP.

He said the prospect of a resumption of power sharing offered a ""brighter future.""

The deal was published at lunchtime on Wednesday - and Northern Ireland Secretary of State Chris Heaton Harris delivering a statement in the Commons.

Mr Heaton Harris said the deal was the ""right one for Northern Ireland and the Union"".

He said: ""Only yesterday we saw how quickly progress has been made with a joint legal solution reached with the European Union on tariff rate quotas. ""This solution, to be taken forward at the next UK-EU joint committee, would ensure that Northern Ireland traders can benefit from the UK's independent free trade policy when importing agri-food goods, reflecting Northern Ireland's integral place in the UK customs territory."" Mr Heaton-Harris said an independent monitoring panel would ensure a ""pragmatic and practical approach without gold plating"". He said the deal will ""recognise the importance of the connections across the United Kingdom now and in the future"", with a new UK east-west economic council bringing businesses and ministers together to ""identify the opportunities that unite us across all parts of the United Kingdom"".

Mr Heaton-Harris said Intertrade UK will be established to promote and facilitate trade within the United Kingdom. He also told MPs: ""This deal will help put Northern Ireland's public services on a sustainable footing with funding totalling over £3 billion to support public services in Northern Ireland, providing a solid foundation for the executive to deliver better outcomes in the day-to-day lives of the people of Northern Ireland.""

On plans to ensure Northern Ireland is no longer automatically aligned with EU law, Chris Heaton-Harris added: ""We will also futureproof Northern Ireland's position within the UK's internal market against any future protocol that would create a new EU law alignment for Northern Ireland, and with it barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom."" The Northern Ireland Secretary had earlier paid tribute to the patience of different political leaders amid negotiations. He said: ""For the last few months my team and I have been holding discussions with the Northern Ireland political parties on how we could see the return of devolved institutions. ""Those discussions have been long and necessarily tough. ""But this is a testament to the patience of all Northern Ireland's political leaders who, as I have seen first hand, work tirelessly to make sure that Northern Ireland is the most prosperous and safe society that it can be.""

Downing Street has said that the deal with the Democratic Unionist Party contains ""significant"" changes to the Windsor Framework's operation. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ""This is our negotiation between the UK and the DUP, this is not about altering the fundamentals of the Windsor Framework. ""We do believe the changes we are implementing are significant and the DUP have made similar comments."" Pressed on the ""significant"" changes, he said that they were to the ""operation of the framework"". He declined to say whether talks have been held with the EU, saying he would not discuss ""private conversations"". He added: ""It's important to make clear that this was a negotiation between the UK and the DUP about ensuring the framework operates properly within the UK.""

What is in the Command Paper

The command paper published by the government is titled Safeguarding The Union. It commits to replacing the green lane, which currently requires a percentage of goods to be checked, with a ""UK internal market system"" that will govern the movement of goods that will remain within the UK. The paper said that would ensure there will be ""no checks when goods move within the UK internal market system save those conducted by UK authorities as part of a risk-based or intelligence-led approach to tackle criminality, abuse of the scheme, smuggling and disease risks"". The paper adds: ""This will ensure the smooth flow of goods that are moving within the UK internal market."" The red lane for transporting goods from GB to NI and on into the EU Single Market will remain, but the command paper offers measures aimed at reducing the volume of trade required to use that red-tape heavy route. The move to reduce post-Brexit checks on GB-NI trade would represent a change to the current EU/UK Windsor Framework agreement and therefore would require Brussels approval.

It is understood decisions on implementing the changes are expected to be examined within the existing EU/UK joint committee framework in the time ahead.

As well as moves to cut Brexit bureaucracy on Irish Sea trade, the command papers includes a series of measures aimed at providing assurances around Northern Ireland's constitutional position within the United Kingdom. Legislation will be tabled with the purpose of ""affirming Northern Ireland's constitutional status underpinned by, among other provisions, the Acts of Union."" The paper said: ""The legislation will affirm Parliament's sovereignty over all matters in Northern Ireland, and address the concern that Northern Ireland's constitutional position in the Union has been weakened by the creation of specific arrangements for trade in goods."" The government has also pledged to amend domestic law, specifically section 7A of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act, to affirm the fact that new EU laws will not automatically apply in Northern Ireland, and must first be subject to democratic oversight by the Stormont Assembly. The oversight procedures already outlined in the Windsor Framework include the so-called Stormont brake mechanism that enables 30 or more MLAs to flag a concern about a new EU law planned to come into effect in Northern Ireland. The Government is obliged to assess whether those concerns meet a threshold that could then result in the UK vetoing the application of the law in the region.

EU law alignment would no longer automatically apply in Northern Ireland under the government's plans to revive Stormont, Chris Heaton-Harris told the Commons. The Northern Ireland Secretary said: ""I am also pleased now to be able to outline today the package of measures we are announcing, which has four key elements. ""First, it further protects Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom by demonstrating our commitment to restoring power sharing so it has the broadest support from across the community in Northern Ireland."" He added: ""I have always believed that making Northern Ireland work, indeed making Northern Ireland thrive, is the surest way to safeguard the Union. I commend all unionists for taking bold steps to make that case for the Union too. ""We will also legislate to reaffirm Northern Ireland's constitutional status including as reflected in the Acts of Union, so too will we recognise in domestic law through the vital democratic safeguard of the Stormont brake that a new assembly would wield the idea of automatic and permanent dynamic alignment with EU law no longer applies.""

The command paper also includes commitments to ensure Northern Ireland goods will always be able to be sold in the GB market regardless of any divergence in EU and UK standards. In respect of further UK divergence from EU standards, there is also a legal requirement that new legislation is assessed as to whether it ""impacts on trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain"". If it does there will be a statutory duty for the relevant minister to make a statement ""considering any impacts on the operation of Northern Ireland's place in the UK's internal market"". A requirement that saw certain goods sold in Northern Ireland to display a label stating ""not for sale in the EU"" will now to extend to cover the whole UK. The government is also creating two new bodies. An UK East-West Council will bring together representatives from government, business and the education sector from Northern Ireland and Great Britain to ""identify opportunities for deepening connections between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK in areas such as trade, transport, education and culture"". Intertrade UK will promote trade within the UK. Among its roles will be to proactively communicate with businesses that currently choose not to sell products in Northern Ireland and identify solutions that could enable them to expand their services to the region.",UK Government publishes deal on post-Brexit checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

2024-02-01,Councils facing 'impossible' task of finding accommodation for homeless refugees,"Council officials have told MSPs it is ""almost impossible"" to find accommodation for homeless refugees following positive asylum decisions.

They told Holyrood's Justice Committee the strains on the homelessness and temporary accommodation system on Thursday.

They all said the housing system is already under pressure due to a lack of supply.

The Home Office initiative to streamline asylum processes means there have been more people approaching local authorities for homeless services, as accommodation provided by the UK Border Agency comes to an end when someone is granted leave to remain.

Glasgow City Council has a backlog of over 600 cases which has been described as an ""almost impossible challenge"".

SNP MSP Bob Doris said he has heard around 600 households are being ""pushed into the homelessness system"" in Glasgow due to their tenancy with accommodation provider Mears coming to an end.

Jim McBride, head of homelessness at Glasgow City Council, said there are now more than 600 cases and the council is dealing with 10 a day.

He told the committee: ""It's presenting serious difficulty for us to manage alternative accommodation options.

""We've identified the fact it's going to be an almost impossible challenge for us to manage.

""Just now we are trying to accommodate 10 on a daily basis, but we're also now finding our ability to even identify hotel accommodation within the city is extremely pressed.""

The council is now looking at vacant buildings to provide accommodation, he said, including an empty nursing home.

Officials from Edinburgh and Fife councils said their local authorities are facing similar issues.

2024-02-01,Alister Jack: 'Sturgeon could cry from one eye if she wants to',"Alister Jack did not believe Nicola Sturgeon's testimony to the UK Covid Inquiry ""for a minute"", saying the former first minister ""could cry from one eye if she wanted to"".

The Scottish secretary is being questioned by the probe in Edinburgh on Thursday a day after the ex-SNP leader made an emotional statement to the inquiry.

Sturgeon became tearful at several moments during the six-and-a-half hour session where she said a ""large part"" of her wished she hadn't been FM during the Covid pandemic.

She denied accusations of secrecy within her government and that she made decisions on coronavirus restrictions for political reasons, including to further the cause of independence.

Her answers were dismissed on Thursday by the Scottish secretary who insisted the Scottish Government tried to be different from the UK Government ""for the sake of it"".

He was asked by lead counsel to the inquiry Jamie Dawson KC: ""Did your pre-existing assumptions result in you failing to believe she could do that (set aside political convictions about independence)?""

He replied: ""I watched that evidence from yesterday and I didn't believe it for a minute.

""I think Nicola Sturgeon could cry from one eye if she wanted to.""

Jack described some of the differences in rules between Scotland and the rest of the UK during the pandemic as ""sort of farcical"".

He said: ""The Scottish Government had moved to this unrealistic zero Covid strategy.

""We had this position where people getting on the train in Glasgow were taking their masks off just north of Carlisle, or coming back up from Euston.

""It was sort of farcical really.

""It spoke to me about unnecessarily affecting people's behaviour.

""Of course it impacted on things like hospitality.""

The Tory secretary admitted there were tensions between the devolved and reserved governments but said that was ""inevitable"" because the SNP want to ""destroy the UK"".

He told the Covid inquiry: ""The then-first minister (Nicola Sturgeon) saw her job as leader of a nationalist government to break up the UK.

He said it was ""inevitable there would be tensions"".

Jack added: ""Devolution works very well but works very well when both governments want to work together.

""But when one government wants to destroy the UK and destroy devolution then there are tensions.

""Those tensions existed before the pandemic, during the pandemic and they exist now today.""

Former deputy first minister - who was also Covid secretary - John Swinney was asked about his contact with the UK government during the pandemic at the probe earlier this week.

He said the Scottish Government did not engage with Jack because he ""contributed nothing of useful value"".

""If the Scottish Government had a problem with the UK Government the best way to solve it was to go directly to the person in the UK Government,"" Swinney said.

""And indeed we had interlocutors who were quite helpful in trying to help resolve these issues.

""In my experience the secretary of state for Scotland would have contributed nothing of useful value in assisting us in that process.""

Like Swinney and Sturgeon, Jack told the inquiry he had also deleted his WhatsApps during Covid - but for different reasons.

While Swinney and Sturgeon said it was Scottish Government policy, Jack said his phone was running out of space.

He said: ""I didn't delete some of my WhatsApp messages, I deleted all of them.""

Jack insisted he deleted no messages related to government business because he did not conduct business via WhatsApp.

2024-02-01,Escaped monkey remains on the loose as search enters fifth day,"The hunt for an escaped monkey has entered its fifth day as experts continue to scour the Highlands.

The Japanese macaque remains on the loose in Kincraig after it broke out of the Highland Wildlife Park on Sunday.

Since then an extensive search, including zoo keepers and drones, has been launched to locate the escapee and bring him back to his enclosure.

2024-02-01,Woman left 'shaken' after men break into home and steal necklace,"A hunt for three men has been launched after a woman was left ""shaken"" following a break-in at her home in West Lothian.

Officers were alerted to the incident around 5.30pm on Wednesday at a house in Falcon Brae, Livingston.

The 62-year-old woman was at home when three men entered the house and made off with a necklace.

Police said she was not hurt, but ""extremely shocked"" by the incident.

The force is now appealing for anyone with information regarding the incident to come forward and has released descriptions of the suspects.

The first man is described as white, around 5ft 10in in height, of medium build with dark blonde hair and was wearing blue jeans and a darker blue hooded jacket.

The second man is described as white, around 25, 5ft in in height, of thin build and was wearing a black mask and black gloves.

The third man is described as white, also around 25 years old, 5ft 9in in height, of thin build and wearing a black jacket, a black mask, and black gloves.

They were last seen walking from the house towards Gowanbank.

Detective sergeant Keith Sinclair of CID said: ""We are carrying out extensive enquiries to trace these three men.

""As part of our investigation, we would be keen to hear from anyone who may have captured any footage on dash-cam or ring door cameras around the time of the incident.

""If you have any information that may assist our investigation, then please contact officers at Livingston quoting incident number 2843 of January 31.

2024-02-01,Alister Jack to appear on final day of UK Covid Inquiry in Edinburgh,"Scottish secretary Alister Jack will appear before the UK Covid Inquiry on Thursday on the final day of the three-week sitting in Edinburgh.

It comes as former first minister Nicola Sturgeon gave evidence on Wednesday, during which she emotional when answering questions about the handling of the pandemic.

She told the Inquiry that a ""large part"" of her wishes she was not first minister during the pandemic and denied allegations of secrecy within her government.

The ex-SNP leader held back tears at several points during the six-and-a-half-hour session in Edinburgh.

Her former deputy, John Swinney told the Inquiry earlier this week that Jack was not often consulted in decision making.

He said efforts were not made to engage with the UK Government minister as he ""would have contributed nothing of useful value"" in problem solving between Holyrood and Westminster.

Claire Mitchell KC, who was appearing on behalf of the Scottish Covid Bereaved Group, said: ""In your written evidence to this inquiry, you say that you experienced 'no tangible presence' of Alister Jack in any aspect of work in handling the pandemic in Scotland.

""My question to you is: were there efforts made to engage him in this process? If so, what?""

Swinney stated: ""The short answer is probably no because there was no real value in it.

""If the Scottish Government had a problem with the UK Government the best way to solve it was to go directly to the person in the UK Government.

""And indeed we had interlocutors who were quite helpful in trying to help resolve these issues.

""In my experience the secretary of state for Scotland would have contributed nothing of useful value in assisting us in that process.""

2024-02-01,Scots urged to talk about mental health as survey finds many mask worries,"A charity is urging people in Scotland to talk about their mental health after research suggested a majority hide their feelings to stop others worrying about them.

See Me said it is important to encourage people to open up about their feelings, as it marked a national day of action seeking to end the stigma around sharing stories about mental health.

The campaign comes after a survey of 5,012 people across the UK, including 1,001 in Scotland, found two-thirds (66%) put on a brave face for family and friends to mask their worries.

Asked why they do this, more than half said they feel there are bigger things going on in the world and over a third said they do not believe people really want to know about their troubles.

The research also revealed nearly half of people surveyed in Scotland (45%) said pressures such as the cost-of-living crisis and the pandemic make them less likely to open up about their mental health because they do not want to add to other people's worries.

The findings were released to mark Time To Talk Day on Thursday, on which people are encouraged to talk and listen to one another and potentially change lives.

Tommy Kelly, a volunteer for See Me from Ayrshire, reflected on a time he refused to believe he had an eating disorder until he opened up to others about how he felt.

""Accepting that I had an eating disorder was important because I became sick and tired of being sick and tired,"" he said.

""I had lost so much of my life already and I understood that I could end up losing my life if I didn't get the help I needed, and accepted that help.

""I had all the help in the world, but I think you have got to want to accept that help. And for me, that was opening up, asking for help and accepting that I had a problem.""

Time To Talk Day campaign is run in Scotland by See Me in partnership with Co-op. A number of activities and events are being held both in person and online to mark the occasion, with various workplaces, schools, community groups and sports clubs across the country signed up to take part.

See Me director Wendy Halliday said: ""Since the pandemic, and through the cost-of-living crisis, we have consistently seen that people struggling with their mental health don't want to burden others by speaking about how they feel.

""We need to challenge this stigma, so people struggling with their mental health know they are not a burden.

""That is why Time To Talk Day continues to be such an important day, because while conversations around mental health in general might be easier, telling someone how you are feeling can still be daunting.""

Rebecca Birkbeck, director of community and member participation at Co-op, said: ""The research shows only a third of 16 to 24-year-olds are comfortable talking about their mental wellbeing.

""Our Co-op member owners want to help make sure that young people feel ready to speak up and speak out.

""That's why we've been working in partnership with Mind, SAMH, Inspire and others to bring communities together to kickstart conversations this Time To Talk Day to bring hope for the future.""

2024-02-01,"Phase-out of fossil fuel heating will fail unless pace increases, ministers told","The ambition to phase out fossil fuel heating in Scottish homes will fail unless the Scottish Government significantly scales up the pace, Scotland's auditor general has warned.

Audit Scotland's latest report has scrutinised the plans to reduce emissions by 2045, which could require most households to change their heating systems.

Auditor general Stephen Boyle has warned of ""significant risks"" in the target to move households to low carbon heating.

The report states: ""The scale of the challenge of reducing emissions from heating homes is huge and there are several risks to success. Unless the scale and pace of activity significantly increase, the Scottish Government's ambition will not be met.""

It is estimated that the Heat in Buildings Strategy, introduced in 2021, could cost £33 billion to the public sector, businesses and households.

The Scottish Government has currently committed to £1.8 billion of public money in this parliamentary term.

The report urges ministers to ensure any investment has ""maximum impact"" and is ""value for money"" given the tough financial situation facing the public.

A significant issue highlighted by auditors is the almost two years spent by officials to build a team to deliver it.

Mr Boyle said ministers should have addressed the capacity needs sooner. But since early 2023, ""good progress"" has been made in preparing to implement regulations.

Ministers have also been warned that success will depend on measures including providing financial support to homeowners and securing public finance and supply chain capacity.

The report noted the work for this is currently at an ""early stage"", with officials told to increase the pace before legislation can be put to the Scottish Parliament.

Mr Boyle said: ""Getting most households in Scotland to change to low carbon heating systems is a huge challenge.

""It is complex and relies upon a range of stakeholders and partners, including the public, the private sector and the UK Government.

""The Scottish Government now needs to carefully consider how to maximise its public spending and set out a clear delivery plan. It also needs to help the private sector to roll out funding deals that will support people to change how they heat their homes.""

Meanwhile, the zero carbon buildings minister, Patrick Harvie, welcomed the report which acknowledged ""good progress"".

But he said it ""also rightly highlighted the huge scale of the challenge to move to clean heat in our homes.

""That challenge is a big part of our climate ambitions which were overwhelmingly supported by Parliament in 2019 and is also critical to a jobs and skills-rich future which frees people from the turbulence of global fossil fuel markets.""

""The end point is not in dispute. That is why we recently published ambitious policy proposals ... that represent a step change in the way we heat our homes and buildings,"" he added.

Scottish Tory net zero spokesman Douglas Lumsden said: ""This is a damning verdict on Patrick Harvie's shambolic plans, that will put enormous costs and conditions on Scottish households.

""Audit Scotland point out that the SNP-Green Government has no chance of meeting its own targets unless there is a substantial increase in pace and activity, and warns of significant risks ahead.

""This is despite years of preparation and an estimated final bill of £33 billion. It shows how detached from reality Patrick Harvie's plans always were.

""Instead of a realistic strategy, Patrick Harvie is producing a hugely expensive timebomb for homeowners - and one which won't be delivered, judging by the slow progress so far.""

Scottish Labour's net zero spokeswoman Sarah Boyack said the report ""lays bare the chaos"" in the plans.

She added: ""With energy bills soaring and fuel poverty rife, it is more urgent than ever that the SNP sets out a clear plan to upgrade homes and modernise heating systems.""

""Warm words don't heat homes - the SNP must listen to Audit Scotland's stark warning and set out a real plan to deliver on their promises,"" she said.","Audit Scotland's latest report has scrutinised the plans to reduce emissions by 2045.

2024-02-01,Pilot scheme to resolve domestic abuse cases early is extended,"A pilot scheme which aims to resolve domestic abuse cases early has been extended to Scotland's busiest court to assess how it can be scaled up to a national level.

Justice Secretary Angela Constance visited Glasgow Sheriff Court on Wednesday to welcome the introduction of the summary case management (SCM) pilot to the city's court.

It follows success at Dundee, Hamilton and Paisley Sheriff Courts, with an interim report published in November showing at least 250 summary trials did not need to assigned because an early resolution was reached.

The pilot sees fewer witnesses attending court unnecessarily by facilitating the early disclose of evidence, early engagement between the Crown and defence and early case management.

The earlier pilot saw a 25% reduction in the first citation of witnesses in domestic abuse cases in the three courts and 34% fewer police witnesses required to attend court.

Outside of the pilot, the majority of witnesses cited in summary sheriff court cases will never appear at a trial, and only about one in 10 police officers will appear to give evidence, with more than 200,000 officers cited as witnesses between 2021 and 2022.

The pilot is intended to be less traumatic for victims and to free up police officers, by focusing on early guilty pleas and improved communication between lawyers in summary cases in sheriff court.

Ms Constance told the PA news agency extending the pilot to Glasgow will be a ""fundamental"" step in assessing how successful the measures could be at a national level.

She said: ""I'm always very interested in new ways of working that have been proven to work so the pilot here in Glasgow, taking place in Scotland's busiest court, is fundamental and will be crucial to informing the next steps.

""It is right and proper that, where reforms have worked at a local level, we consider how that can be scaled up to a national level.""

The Justice Secretary added: ""This is, of course, the busiest court in Scotland so this pilot will have a big impact.

""First and foremost, this new way of managing cases will benefit victims and complainers.

""It will improve our trauma-informed approaches so there will be less call on victims and witnesses to appear in court. This is all about dealing with cases earlier in the process so that justice can be done timeously.""

Sheriff Principal Aisha Anwar, who had led the pilot's development, said: ""I was keen to build on the early success of the pilot by introducing it to the busiest court in Scotland.

""That has been possible as a result of excellent cross justice collaboration between the police, the Crown, the defence, SCTS, the judiciary and the Scottish Legal Aid Board and I thank all of those involved for their participation.""",a pilot scheme which aims to resolve domestic abuse cases early has been extended to Scotland's busiest court.

2024-02-01,More than half of students used generative AI to help prepare assessments - poll,"The majority of university students have used generative artificial intelligence (AI) to help them with their studies, a survey suggests.

More than one in eight undergraduate students (13%) said they have used generative AI to generate text for assessment but they edited the content themselves before submitting it, according to the report from the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) think tank.

The rise of generative AI tools - such as ChatGPT and Google Bard - has sparked concerns about cheating among students in the education sector.

But the report by Hepi suggests that only 5% of students surveyed admitted incorporating AI-generated text into assessments without editing it personally.

A poll, of 1,250 undergraduate students in the UK through the Ucas admissions service, suggests that 53% of students have used generative AI to help them prepare assessments.

Of these students, the most popular use is as an 'AI private tutor' with 36% of students reporting that they used AI to explain concepts to them.

Other popular uses of AI include suggesting ideas for research and summarising articles, the report found.

The study which was carried out in partnership with EdTech company Kortext, suggests a ""digital divide"" in AI use may be emerging.

The survey, which was carried out in November 2023, found that nearly three-fifths of students (58%) from the most privileged backgrounds reported using generative AI to help prepare assessments, compared with just half (51%) from the least privileged backgrounds.

Those with Asian ethnic backgrounds are also much more likely to have used generative AI than white or black students, and male students use it more than female students.

The report calls on institutions to provide AI tools for those who cannot afford them - when they have been identified as benefiting learning - to prevent the ""digital divide"" from growing,

It adds that institutions should develop clear policies on what AI use is acceptable and what is unacceptable.

Nearly two in three students believe their institution has a ""clear"" policy on AI use (63%) and their institution could spot work produced by AI (65%), the survey suggests.

Josh Freeman, policy manager at Hepi and author of the report, said: ""Students trust institutions to spot the use of AI tools and they feel staff understand how AI works.

""As a result, rather than having AI chatbots write their essays, students are using AI in more limited ways: to help them study but not to do all the work.

""However, action is urgently needed to stop a new 'digital divide' from growing. AI tools are still new and often unknown. For every student who uses generative AI every day, there is another who has never opened ChatGPT or Google Bard, which gives some students a huge advantage.

""The divide will only grow larger as generative AI tools become more powerful. Rather than merely adopting a punitive approach, institutions should educate students in the effective use of generative AI - and be prepared to provide AI tools where they can aid learning.""

A spokesperson for Universities UK (UUK) said: ""The findings in this study highlight the importance of crystal-clear policies surrounding the use of AI and we know universities are increasingly focusing on this.

""The potential risks and benefits posed by AI to higher education have been known to the sector for some time, and any new developments are closely monitored.

""Currently, all universities have codes of conduct that include severe penalties for students found to be submitting work that is not their own and engage with students from day one to underline the implications of cheating and how it can be avoided.""",53% of students have used generative AI to help them prepare assessments.

2024-02-01,Giant glowing heart lights up Edinburgh's St Giles Cathedral,"A large glowing heart has started beating in Edinburgh celebrating the life and legacy of the great poet Robert Burns.

The illumination has been suspended right at the centre of St Giles cathedral and promises a three-dimensional experience.

It is the latest installation to be brought to Edinburgh by German artist Michael Pendry.

""It goes through different phases, it's showing what a heart can do. It burns, it pulsates, it's even bleeding,"" he said.

""It's music, it's light, it's a three-dimensional experience for all the senses.""

The work, measuring five metres tall, has transformed the space with a ticketed evening illumination and soundscape for visitors.

With the world facing uncertain times with climate change and conflict, the artist said he wanted to remind people of what life is really about.

Michael said: ""Lots of people are worried and afraid that our world as we know it is falling apart, in many ways and for many reasons, and to come back to what's really important again in life.

""And I think that is a lack that is getting bigger and bigger, that empathy, the talking to each other and showing emotions and at the end of the day, love.""

The work is on show as part of the Burns and Beyond festival, an annual celebration of great poet Robert Burns.

The festival programme also includes live music, Burns ceilidhs and other events throughout the city.

""It's beautiful and we're so pleased to welcome Michael Pendry back to Burns and Beyond and to St Giles Cathedral with another stunning art piece,"" said Alan Thomson from Unique Events.

""He was here two years ago with a flock of doves which took over the whole cathedral, but this installation is a UK premier so the first time it's been shown outside Munich.

""So, we're so pleased to have it here both for Burns and Beyond but also to celebrate the 900th anniversary of St Giles.""

2024-02-01,'I looked like I'd had a stroke' - Mum's cosmetic injection nightmare,"Marie Snapp booked in to have Botox and lip filler treatments after the birth of her son.

She is no stranger to cosmetic injectables, having had Botox a few times before.

But alarm bells started to sound during the appointment.

Marie, who has a background in beauty therapy, says the injector didn't give her a safety or consent form when she arrived at the salon.

""This girl that I went to had amazing feedback,"" she told Scotland Tonight. ""Everybody was posting pictures and talking about how good it was and her work did look good. She looked very professional. She had her little nurse's uniform on.

""I thought it was strange, but then again, I kept thinking maybe it's because I spoke to her and she knows that I'm quite aware of Botox. I kept quiet. But I should have listened to my gut.""

Marie says a few hours later, one of her eyebrows moved higher and the other lower. She contacted the injector who told her to come back in so she could fix it.

She said: ""I went in and then when she was injecting me again, I thought 'oh my god', it just felt like she was going overboard with it. Then a couple of days later I saw my face was just getting weaker and weaker, especially on one side. It was a mess.""

Marie found a group of other people online who had also suffered at the hands of the injector.

Soon after she discovered the woman had no medical qualifications, despite saying she was a nurse. The salon owner was never punished, but Marie believes as soon as word got out, she left Glasgow.

""She just blocked me,"" she said. ""There was no interaction. There was nothing. It was horrible and I looked horrible, and I was embarrassed as well because I just never thought I would get scammed.""

Marie now runs her own, award-winning, salon Panache Therapies. She doesn't offer injectables.

""I'm not interested in anything that can come with major side effects,"" she said. ""I don't like the thought of being in control of somebody's toxins and other people's bodies. I do get the treatment, but I definitely wouldn't offer them. Like a couple of times my clients always say why don't you do Botox? It's just not my cup of tea.""

In the UK, there aren't any laws restricting who can perform treatments like Botox and filler.

However, medical professionals like doctors, nurses and dentists who want to offer cosmetic injections have to pay to join an official register. But there's no requirement for non-medics to do the same.

Marie said she's seen a lot of inexperienced beauticians post on public Facebook groups asking for advice about what to do when Botox or filler goes wrong.

She said: ""They will be like what should I do? And I'm thinking, if you don't know, just tell them to phone a doctor, tell them to go to the chemist. But they're asking a Facebook group full of other people that don't know.

""Whereas if their training included all of this, and if it was governed in any way, there could be a phone number that you phone.

""When I lived in America, you had to be licensed in each state and there was a state exam you had to take. Everything was very well controlled. I feel like if there was something like that here for any procedure it would help.

""I've been for plenty of treatments where they've not said to me you know there's risk of scarring, there's risk of burning. They're just going in completely clueless of what could happen, and I think that's dangerous.""

Fiona Ross is also calling for there to be more training for people who want to offer cosmetic injectables. She owns The Aesthetics Club in Bearsden and is a qualified nurse.

She said: ""Once Botox is injected into the skin, you can't take it out. So if that's injected incorrectly, there's a huge risk that problems could arise and those problems can last for a number of weeks. They can last up to 12 weeks.

""If dermal fillers are injected into a blood vessel that's going to block the blood supply to the tissue. It can also lead to complications such as visual disturbances and blindness. That can be irreversible.""

Fiona says it's important for people who are injecting clients to have a medical background.

""We know the protocols to follow and know how to manage these problems quickly and effectively,"" she said. ""Someone who doesn't have a medical background maybe wouldn't spot a complication quite so early on and have the tools to treat it effectively.""

When asked by Scotland Tonight how she feels about cheap anti-wrinkle injectable treatments being offered across the country, Fiona said: 'In the UK we're seeing a huge amount of cheap products coming to market and they're not science-backed.

""There's not a huge amount of research behind them to show that they are safe and that and that they're appropriate for treatment. And with that, because of their lower price point, they often fall into non-medic hands, which can lead to a whole host of other problems.

2024-02-01,Medics join forces to demand tougher regulation of cosmetic injectables,"Doctors, dentists and nurses have formed a new campaign group in a bid to better regulate who can offer anti-wrinkle and filler injections in Scotland.

Currently, there are no laws in Scotland around who can offer cosmetic injections.

But the number of complaints about botched procedures carried out by people with no medical qualifications is on the rise.

Save Face, a UK-wide register of medical aesthetic practitioners, received 233 reports in 2021.

In 2022, that increased to 292.

Scotland Tonight was given exclusive access to the first meeting of the new group of medics.

Dr John Elder, a GP in Inverness and senior partner at Glen Eden Aesthetics, said: ""My biggest concern is the explosion of unregulated practitioners we've seen over the past ten to 15 years. A huge number of people are picking up syringes and injecting, it's quite bizarre.

""The UK is alone in Europe. It's actually alone in the whole of both North and South America. It's the only country in which people who have no medical background can inject with just the permission of the recipient, quite bizarrely.""

Since 2017, medical professionals who offer cosmetic treatments have had to register with Healthcare Improvement Scotland (HIS).

It carries out inspections of clinics, takes enforcement action against practitioners not meeting its standards, and deals with complaints from clients.

However, non-medics do not need to register with HIS, or any other body, in order to offer the same treatments.

Dr Elder said: ""We all see and treat complications from lay practitioners and we're seeing an explosion of this - predominantly overfilled lips, inappropriate filler toxin.

""They're accountable to no one apart from themselves and their conscience. And that's part of the problem.

""They may claim to be insured, but the insurance is questionable and their qualification is non-registerable to be doing procedures, so it's a completely bizarre situation.""

Nurse Jacqui Cooney, who runs her own clinic, said: ""For a person to set up a clinic, we have to write a set of up to 28 policies.

""There is a fee to register, and depending on the size of your clinic, you have an ongoing regular fee to pay, which can be from £1,000 up to around £5,000.

""We welcome the regulation, we want to be regulated. However, we feel that there is a bit of an injustice going on from the government point of view, where HIS have been asked to regulate us, but no one else in Scotland is regulated.""

Changes are under way elsewhere in the UK.

In England, a law was introduced three years ago, making it illegal for under 18s to receive botox and fillers, however no such law exists in Scotland.

The UK Government is also considering introducing a minimum standard of training for all injectors.

Dr Elder said: ""[Discussions with the Scottish Government] fell flat with Covid and in the sort of the recovery period after Covid, there's been an unwillingness to to engage in any form of useful dialogue, but it's likely that we'll be writing to the Scottish Government to try and force dialogue forward.""

Ms Cooney added: ""We have always kind of fought this little corner on their own as each individual professional body, but we've all come together today as one large group of professional bodies and hopefully all Healthcare Improvement Scotland regulated clinics will come on board with this.

""We're trying to protect the public and trying to protect these people from feeling like they just have nowhere to go, because lots of people feel silly when they have these kinds of treatments.

""It's almost like being conned out of money and they're embarrassed to come forward.""

The Scottish Government says existing legislation requires all licenced medicines to be prescribed by a regulated healthcare practitioner, who remains responsible for the administration and care.

Public health minister Jenni Minto said: ""Independent healthcare clinics in Scotland where aesthetic services are provided by a medical practitioner, dental practitioner, registered nurse, registered midwife or dental care professional are regulated by Healthcare Improvement Scotland.

""When considering the provision of non-surgical cosmetic procedures, healthcare professionals must take into account the physical and psychological wellbeing of the patient or client, including their age where that is a factor.

""We want to ensure all non-surgical cosmetic procedures in Scotland are delivered from hygienic premises by appropriately trained practitioners, applying recognised standards and using regulated products.

""At present there is no specific legislation to prevent individuals who are not health professionals and who operate from unregistered premises from carrying out non-surgical cosmetic procedures that pierce or penetrate the skin.

""Public consultation has shown overwhelming support for tighter regulation of non-surgical cosmetic procedures, including dermal fillers.

""We are working on introducing secondary legislation to enable Healthcare Improvement Scotland to regulate independent healthcare services, including aesthetic services, which are provided by pharmacists and pharmacy technicians from premises other than registered pharmacies, or outwith the terms of NHS contracts.

""We are working with key stakeholders to consider the potential scope of further regulation of non-surgical cosmetic procedures.""","Doctors, dentists and nurses have formed a new campaign group in a bid to better regulate who can offer anti-wrinkle and filler injections in Scotland.

2024-01-31,Appeal to driver issued after pedestrian died in fatal crash with bus,"A motorist who may have witnessed a fatal crash between a bus and a pedestrian in Glasgow on Saturday is being urged to come forward to police.

The 64-year-old man was struck by a bus at 7.30am on January 27 on Great Western Road, near the junction with Horselethill Road.

He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Officers are keen to speak with the driver of a blue/grey VW Sharan or Touran taxi which was travelling on Great Western Road.

Police say the driver may have witnessed the incident or could have dashcam footage that could assist with inquiries.

Road policing sergeant Scott Gourlay said: ""Extensive inquiries remain ongoing to establish the full circumstances of this crash.

""Think back, were you in that area that day and did you see what happened? If so, please get in touch.

2024-01-31,Community football club to take ownership of grounds for £1,"A grassroots football club with more than 700 players has been given the go ahead to take ownership of its grounds from Midlothian Council for £1.

Councillors this week agreed the nominal fee to allow Bonnyrigg Rose Community Football Club to take over Poltonhall Sports Complex nearly six years after it faced closure.

The club first applied for the community asset transfer of the grounds in 2019 after Midlothian Council said it was considering closing it down.

However the process was delayed after it was revealed the club was not at that time an incorporated body making it ineligible,

Instead the club agreed to lease the site for £42 a month until it was able to apply for the transfer in an application which went before councillors yesterday.

The transfer will see the club take ownership of the sports complex including its astro pitches, grass pitches, pavilion, a caretaker's flat and a car park. A public footpath which runs through the site will remain in council ownership.

A report on the sports site said that if it remained in council ownership and was sold on the open market it could achieve a total price of £210,000.

The caretaker's flat was valued at around £40,000 worth and, the report said, required around £74,000 investment to bring it up to a standard which would allow it to be rented out.

However the committee heard the flat itself was only accessible through the sports building so was not suitable for council rent separate from the club.

The report also estimated annual maintenance costs of the site up to £25,000 a year.

The community club works with all ages including those with neurodiversity challenges as well as working on mental health well-being and therapy projects.

In its business plan presented to the council it says while Bonnyrigg also has a professional senior team, Bonnyrigg Rose Athletic who are based at the town's New Dundas Park, it is a separate organisation.

Councillor Kelly Parry thanked the club and council officers for the work to bring the application to the point where it could now be passed.

The committee approved the asset transfer with Councillor Colin Cassidy, chairing the committee said: ""The work that they do up at Bonnyrigg Rose just isn't about football and kicking balls about a pitch, There is so much more in-depth that goes on up there.""",Bonnyrigg Rose Community Football Club given the go ahead to take over Poltonhall Sports Complex.

2024-01-31,Driver who indecently assaulted and threatened woman loses licence,"A Glasgow private hire car driver who indecently assaulted a woman and threatened to abduct her while working has lost his licence.

Mazin Mohamed seized the passenger by the breast during the terrifying ordeal in a city street in April 2022.

Calling for Mohamed to have his licence suspended, Police Scotland said he was not a 'fit and proper person' to hold one.

Police inspector Gareth Griffiths said there are ""serious concerns over public safety"" and asked Glasgow city's licensing board to immediately suspend Mohamed's licence.

Board chair councillor Alex Wilson, SNP, said: ""This is appalling. We don't expect this type of behaviour from private car hire drivers.""

Mohamed was found guilty of assaulting the woman in court last year and ordered to carry out 240 hours of unpaid work.

He was also sentenced to a restriction of liberty order keeping him at home between 7pm and 7am.

The board suspended his licence immediately this morning during its meeting in the city.

2024-01-31,Calls for exhibition recognising Billy Connolly to be held in Glasgow,"A Billy Connolly exhibition should be held at Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum to recognise his contribution to Glasgow.

Councillor George Redmond, the city's Labour group leader, wants Glasgow Life -- which runs the city's museums on behalf of the council -- to consider a display on the Big Yin.

The Glasgow Labour leader, who raised his proposal at a meeting of the city's administration committee last week, said there are ""few people who have promoted the city as well as he has"".

He suggested future exhibitions could focus on other famous Glaswegians such as Alex Ferguson or Kenny Dalglish.

A spokeswoman for Glasgow Life said the arms-length organisation has previously worked on projects with Billy Connolly, but is ""always keen to hear what people would like to see more of"".

She added the city's collection includes ""popular and much-loved Billy Connolly related objects"" such as ""his iconic banana boots and John Byrne's popular portrait at the People's Palace"".

At the council meeting, Cllr Redmond said he would ""really like to see an exhibition about Billy Connolly at some point, and it should be in Kelvingrove given his Partick roots"".

Following the meeting, the Labour group leader said: ""Billy Connolly is not just a Glasgow icon, he's a Scottish icon. He has been a fantastic ambassador for Glasgow, for Scotland, in everything that he does.

""One of the things that is so important to him is his upbringing in Glasgow. I think having an exhibition about Billy Connolly would be absolutely fantastic for Glasgow and probably the whole of Scotland.

""He's given us so much, I don't think it's a lot to ask to give him something back in return.""

The Glasgow Life spokeswoman said: ""Billy Connolly needs no introduction to the people of Glasgow. His boundless talent as a comedian, actor and presenter makes him one of Scotland's most famous sons.""

She said, in 2015, Glasgow Life worked with him to display ""his own extraordinary works at the People's Palace"" and, in 2017, worked with the BBC to show artists John Byrne, Jack Vettriano and Rachel Maclean's portraits of the comedian, which were turned into large artworks around the city.

""Glasgow Life Museums welcome more than three million visitors each year, many of these come to enjoy the engaging and intriguing exhibitions on offer. We are always keen to hear what people would like to see more of and to develop new and innovative ways of making this accessible.

""All suggestions are considered at regular content development meetings, which plan several years in advance.""","Billy Connolly exhibition should be held at Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum.

The 28-year-old attacking midfielder has made 16 appearances for the English League One side this season.

He will now move to Tynecastle to join with Steven Naismith's squad as they look to cement their position in third place.

Fraser came through the ranks at Dundee United and made his professional debut at Tannadice as a teenager in 2014 before moving to Airdrie for a season long.

He returned to the Tayside club the following year and made a total of 106 appearances before moving south to Burton Albion in 2018.

Spells at MK Dons and Ipswich Town then followed before he made the move to Charlton three years ago.

After the move was confirmed on Wednesday, with just over 24 hours left of the transfer window, Steven Naismith said: ""I'm pleased that we've been able to get the deal done and welcome Scott into the squad.

2024-01-31,Carer caused elderly woman to fall then dragged her along bathroom floor,"A care worker who caused an elderly woman to fall and then dragged her along the bathroom floor by the underarms has been given a warning.

Salieu Ruffai was working as a social care assistant at Orchard Grove House in Glasgow in July 2022 when an incident involving a vulnerable woman took place.

Ruffai was said to have used ""incorrect moving and handling procedures"" when attempting to move a woman from her chair without waking her.

She caused the woman to fall and then failed to use a hoist when helping afterward.

Rather than seeking help, the care assistant dragged the pensioner along the floor from the bathroom to her chair by her underarms.

Following the incident, she failed to tell her bosses that the fall had even occurred.

Ruffai was reported to the Scottish Social Services Council (SSSC) who found she had ""violated"" the woman's rights and ""placed her at risk of serious physical and emotional harm"".

Their report added: ""By failing to seek assistance or to report that AA had fallen placed her at further risk of harm and showed a disregard for her wellbeing.

""Service users have a reasonable expectation that they can rely on social service workers and expect that they will be cared for appropriately and that they will not be placed at unnecessary risk of harm.""

It was decided that a warning should be placed on the care assistant's registration for a period of three years.","Care worker caused elderly woman to fall and dragged her along bathroom floor by underarms.

2024-01-31,Train crash with tree that left driver injured was 'totally avoidable',"An accident in which a train travelling at 84mph crashed into a fallen tree was 'totally preventable', a rail union claimed.

The passenger train was ""horrendously"" damaged after it struck a tree which had fallen across the track at Broughty Ferry amid heavy rain and winds brought by Storm Gerrit on December 28.

ASLEF, the rail drivers union, told STV News that a member of the public called Network Rail's control centre, which is outsourced in Milton Keynes, to report that the tree had fallen from their garden onto the railway line.

The union claimed it took the control centre more than ten minutes to contact their Scottish counterparts and that it also took them seven times to get through.

Kevin Lindsay, ASLEF's Scottish organiser said: ""This is an accident that was totally preventable, it's just negligence on behalf of Network Rail and their contractors.

""I think it's scandalous, it's not that long ago I was standing talking about the horrific events at Carmont. Here we have another HST train involved in a crash which could have led to loss of life to the train driver and passengers.

""That is not acceptable and Network Rail needs to be held accountable.""

The driver received minor injuries as a result of the accident. The driving cab of the train was heavily damaged, disabling the train and requiring its passengers to be evacuated.

An investigation is currently under way by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch into the incident.

A Network Rail spokesperson said: ""Safety is our top priority and we invest millions each year in our trackside to remove vegetation and other risks to the railway.

""We are working with the Rail Accident Investigation Branch to provide all available information to support their investigation and are leading a separate industry review of the incident with partners from across Scotland's Railway.

2024-01-31,Scottish Michelin Star restaurant to be sold by family after 10 years,"One of Scotland's 12 Michelin star restaurants is to be sold by the current owners after 10 years in business.

The Cellar in Anstruther, Fife announced to customers on social media that the restaurant will be sold by owner and head chef Billy Boyter and his family.

The eatery earned the coveted one Michelin Star status in 2015 and is part of an elite dozen of restaurants in the country.

In a post, the restaurant confirmed a sale was to be processed as it felt like the ""right time"".

A statement read: ""After a lot of thought and consideration, my family and I have decided it's the right time to sell The Cellar. It's been an amazing 10 years and I'm so proud of what we've created in our time.

""I'd like to thank all of our amazing suppliers. We could never have achieved what we did without you. It's been an absolute pleasure working with you all.

""And of course thank you to all of our amazing guests, some of whom we now regard more as friends. We'll miss all of you. Thank you so much for being part of the journey.""

The restaurant informed customers they will be contacted over outstanding deposits and voucher refunds.

Scottish chef Peter Jukes, who died in 2013, previously ran the restaurant before it reopened a year later under new ownership.

The Michelin Guide for The Cellar reads: ""Something of an icon in these parts, this restaurant is tucked away through an arch on a narrow side street.

""Local chef Billy Boyter's great strength is his understanding of flavours: he likes to blend numerous layers of flavour and, while each one stands out by itself, it also complements the others and brings the dish together as a whole.

The Scottish Labour leader had previously accused Liz Truss of being a ""Thatcher tribute act"" who would rather ""boost bankers' bonuses than help those in need.

It comes as shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said she instead wants to be a ""champion"" of the financial services sector as she bids to drive up economic growth.

The cap was introduced in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to limit annual payouts to twice a banker's salary.

But it was scrapped last year after a decision was made in Liz Truss's brief spell in No 10 by her chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng.

Reeves' decision to continue allowing unlimited payouts to bankers marks another major shift in Labour's direction, with Jeremy Corbyn having labelled the financial sector ""speculators and gamblers who crashed our economy"" during his leadership of the party.

In an interview with the BBC, Reeves, a former Bank of England economist, said: ""The cap on bankers' bonuses was brought in in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and that was the right thing to do to rebuild the public finances.

""But that has gone now and we don't have any intention of bringing that back.

""And as chancellor of the exchequer, I would want to be a champion of a successful and thriving financial services industry in the UK.""

The move comes as Labour was pledging to ""unashamedly champion"" the financial services sector as it seeks to win over big business in the election year.

The party on Wednesday published a plan it said would streamline regulations, with a promise to slim down the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCS) handbook by cutting out ""outdated and prescriptive rules"".

It follows a review, carried out by shadow City minister Tulip Siddiq, which included input and advice from top City of London figures, including former HSBC chairman Sir Douglas Flint and Barclays chairman Sir John Kingman.

In her forward to the report, Reeves said Labour would be both ""proudly pro-business, pro-worker"" in government, with former FCA chairman Charles Randell calling it a blueprint for the ""inclusive and sustainable growth of the financial sector"".

It sees the party take inspiration from Margaret Thatcher's ""Tell Sid"" advertising campaign in the 1980s, most recently referenced by Chancellor Jeremy Hunt at the autumn statement, and which encouraged people to buy shares amid the privatisation of state-owned businesses.

Labour said it would ""look to deliver a modern ""Tell Sid"" campaign for retail ownership to highlight the value of British people supporting British businesses"".

Speaking with STV News on Wednesday, Sarwar declined to speak out on the u-turn, adding that he is ""not here to defend bankers bonuses"".

He said: ""We were right to call out, I think, the UK Government for the lifting of the cap in the middle of an economic crisis.

""I think I described it at the time as a further demonstration of an economically illiterate, morally bankrupt Tory party. I still do.

When asked if he still believed that, he replied: ""I still believe that to be the case that this is a morally bankrupt, economically illiterate Tory party.

When asked if Sarwar believed removing the cap is ""still economically illiterate and morally bankrupt"", he responded: ""I stand by what I said when the Conservatives made that announcement. It demonstrated the wrong priorities. We were in the midst of an economic crisis and they thought our priority was to lift the cap on bankers bonuses. A further example of their economically illiterate, morally bankrupt nature.

When asked if it was the right priority now, he responded: ""So, we're not in government and if we were to be in government, we have got to fix a lots of problems that the Tories have created.""

The SNP's social justice spokesman David Linden accused Sir Keir of ""offering no change from broken Brexit Britain"".

""By admitting he would slash funding for public services while helping the super-rich, Starmer has shown he has the wrong priorities and is on the side of the wealthy Westminster elite, not ordinary working families,"" he said.","Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar declines to criticise leadership south of the border.

2024-01-31,Bus window blown out while crossing bridge as winds reach 70mph,"A bus window was blown out while it was travelling across the Tay Road Bridge during strong winds.

The Stagecoach bus was on the Tay Road Bridge heading towards Dundee around 9am on Wednesday morning when heavy winds caused damage to the back window.

The bridge was closed to traffic northbound after a window from the Stagecoach 46 bus which was travelling on the carriageway fell out.

Teams working on the bridge had to clear a ""significant amount of glass"" from the road which took around 20 minutes.

A cars-only restriction, which includes single decker buses, was in place.

A spokesperson for Stagecoach East Scotland said: ""Heavy winds caused damage to the rear window on one of our vehicles this morning, whilst travelling across the Tay Road Bridge. There were no injuries as a result.

2024-01-31,Scottish Government announces date XL bully ban will come into force,"XL bully dogs will be banned in Scotland from July unless owners have applied for an exemption certificate, the Scottish Government has announced.

Holyrood has outlined its two-stage approach to the new legal safeguards on XL bully dogs.

The measures are a ""consequence"" of similar controls being introduced in England and Wales, which has resulted in reports of dogs being moved to Scotland.

The first stage will come into force next month if given parliamentary approval.

From February 23, it will remain legal to own an XL bully dog but owners must ensure their dogs are muzzled and on a lead when in a public place.

Selling, gifting or exchanging XL bully dogs will also be prohibited.

Stage two will come into force from July 31 and will make it an offence to own an XL Bully without an exemption certificate or having applied for an exemption certificate.

This means existing XL bully dog owners will need to consider whether they want to keep their dogs and, if so, will have to apply and pay for an exemption permit by that date.

Information on the opening date for applications for an exemption, how to apply and the support available will be announced in the coming weeks, the Scottish Government has said.

Anyone found to be breaching the new safeguards face up to six months in prison and a fine of up to £5,000.

Minister for Victims & Community Safety Siobhian Brown said: ""It is vital XL bully dog owners get ready for the first stage of legal safeguards that will come into force on February 23. These new rules are intended to prevent risks to public safety and animal welfare and keep our communities safe.

""The second stage of legal safeguards will provide owners seeking an exemption an appropriate length of time to decide how to prepare for the forthcoming change in the law ahead of the July 31 deadline.

""The vast majority of dog owners are responsible animal lovers and we know owning a dog brings with it important responsibilities. I would encourage owners to make themselves aware of the new laws and get ready for them.""","Holyrood outlines two-stage approach to new legal safeguards on XL bully dogs.

2024-01-31,Dead whale carcass on shoreline left to decompose naturally,"The carcass of an 17-metre fin whale that washed up on a Scottish shoreline last week will not be removed.

The discovery of the massive mammal was made by a member of the public in the village of Culross, Fife, at around 4.30pm on Wednesday, January 24.

Footage was captured of the 17-metre whale washed up on the shoreline with efforts under way last week on how best to remove the carcass from the water.

An on-site assessment was made by teams from Fife Coast and Countryside Trust (FCCT) but a final decision was postponed.

Various methods of disposing of the remains were discussed including burial, towing it to sea or transporting the carcass to landfill or by incinerating it.

After consultation with multiple representatives, the decision was taken to let the whale's body decompose naturally in its current position.

FCCT say this will enrich the coastal environment with nutrients and provide an important food source for wildlife during the winter period.

Members of the public are being advised not to access the shoreline with the carcass is monitored by teams.

Robbie Blyth, head of operations at FFCT, said: ""When possible, biologists and veterinarians from the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme examine a carcass and conduct a necropsy to try to learn why the mammal may have died.

""On this occasion the whale had already started to putrefy and was not suitable for investigation.

""This is one of the reasons we have decided not to recover the carcass. Also, its location - at the foot of the railway embankment coastal defences - would have presented a challenge in recovering it.

""The location is relatively inaccessible to beach users and dog walkers and we believe that leaving it in situ causes the least disruption to locals and visitors.

""The decision not to recover the carcass has been made after full consultation with key stakeholders and partners including Fife Council, community representatives, Network Rail, Forth Ports, Forth Estuary Forum, NatureScot, SEPA, and Marine Scotland.""

Danny Groves from Whale and Dolphin Conservation said: ""It is always distressing to see such an awesome ocean creature like a large whale looking helpless on the shoreline.

""It is believed that this whale is a fin - the second largest creature on our shared planet, but what caused he or she to strand like this will only be known after tests on samples taken from the whale.

""Sometimes we never discover exactly, but many manmade threats can cause them to wash up dead or alive.

""These include loud underwater noise pollution from exploration for oil and gas or military exercises in the area, collisions with boats, and entanglement in fishing nets or gear.

""Some may get disorientated whilst following prey or simply fall ill.

""What makes this incident all the more tragic is that we need more whales alive to keep the ocean healthy.

""Growing whale populations helps us in our fight against climate breakdown because they help deliver and circulate nutrients in the ocean.

""For example, it is estimated that by restoring blue whales to their pre-whaling numbers would have the same positive impact on the climate as planting more than 280 million trees.""","carcass of a 17-metre fin whale washed up on a Scottish shoreline last week.

2024-01-31,Huw Jones eager to star again for Scotland in Six Nations,"Scotland centre Huw Jones will embrace the high expectations he set for himself as he looks to build on his impressive Guinness Six Nations comeback.

The Glasgow back enjoyed some big moments in the tournament earlier in his career, including scoring twice against England in both 2017 and 2018.

But he fell out of favour for spells at Glasgow under Dave Rennie and did not start a game in the Six Nations in 2021 or 2022 before reviving his career at Harlequins and then on his return to Warriors.

Jones scored four tries and was named in last year's official team of the championship after making an emphatic return to the tournament.

With 16 tries in 43 internationals in all, Jones is looking to make a major contribution in this year's Six Nations as Scotland prepare to open their campaign against Wales in Cardiff on Saturday.

""Having got back into the squad and the team for the last Six Nations, and getting an extended run of games, I find myself being a little more commanding in the position, and taking that ownership to the next level,"" the 30-year-old said.

""When you get a run of games, anyone feels more confident. Going into this, it's something I want to build on and be a player who guys will look to to break the game up or make a big play.

""I still feel I am learning, developing as a player across the board - strength, conditioning, skills - I am still learning my game. I definitely feel I have more to give.""

Jones was singled out by Gregor Townsend for two missed tackles as Scotland lost in Cardiff in the autumn of 2018 but he is not dwelling on those memories ahead of his return to the Principality Stadium.

""It was certainly a tough day,"" he said. ""The good thing is that's quite a long time ago so I've had time to reflect and the biggest thing is I've had time to learn and improve.

""It's not something I think about really anymore, it's actually not really crossed my mind this week. If you look back at that, it was a bit of a shocker.

""Everyone has bad games in their career, you don't want to have them in a big game, but it's a few years ago now.

""I've definitely improved, I've learned a lot as a player and a person. I wouldn't say it haunts me or anything. I've moved on from it.""

Jones is also not getting caught up in the stats around Scotland's record in Wales.

Although Townsend's side won in Llanelli in 2020 during the pandemic, they have not triumphed in Cardiff for 22 years.

""It's not really been a huge talking point for us,"" Jones said. ""We are obviously aware of it but it's not a primary motivation, to go and break a record.

""We did it with England, beat France away, there's a few things we have done to change those records. So it's not a huge talking point but having done it a couple of times makes it less daunting.""","Huw Jones scored four tries and was named in last year's official team of the championship after making an emphatic return to the Six Nations.

2024-01-31,SQA exams could be held off-site for school found with RAAC,"Exams for pupils at Forres Academy may have to be held in a community centre as repair works continue following the discovery of 'crumbling concrete' last year.

The potentially dangerous reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC) was found in the building in July 2023.

The majority of prelim exams are taking place at Forres House community centre and in an update to parents and guardians, Moray Council said that discussions are ongoing as to whether this will also be the case for exams in May.

More information regarding this will be issued soon, the council added.

Classrooms, including those used for science, drama, and technical subjects, had been closed in September on the advice of structural engineers and work has now been completed on them.

Home economics is the only practical class still being taught off-site but it is anticipated that work on the new classroom should be completed by the end of April 2024.

Moray Council said two phases of a repair programme had been completed, and a third was progressing in line with projected timescales.

Chair of Moray Council's education, communities and leisure services committee, Councillor Kathleen Robertson, said: ""I would like to thank every single person who is working within the school to help get it back and operating as closely to original levels.

""The progress made to recover so much of the schools teaching space and minimise disruption is fantastic. The entire staff and pupil's response during this unsettling period is nothing short of outstanding and I commend everyone at Forres Academy for their continued resilience.""","Moray Council said discussions are ongoing as to whether this will also be the case for exams in May.

2024-01-31,Tearful Sturgeon says part of her wishes she wasn't FM during Covid,"An emotional Nicola Sturgeon has told the UK Covid Inquiry that a ""large part"" of her wishes she was not first minister during the pandemic.

The former SNP leader held back tears as she said she had tried to be the ""best first minster"" she could be over the course of Covid.

Sturgeon denied that decisions she took during the pandemic were done for political reasons, adding she had not ""thought less"" about politics and Scottish independence in her life than she did during the pandemic.

""I was motivated solely by trying to do the best we could to keep people as safe as possible,"" she added.

""We did that to some extent, but not to, and perhaps we never could have done it to the extent I would have wished we could have done.

""I carry the regret for the loss of life, the loss of opportunity, the loss of education of our young people, I carry that with me every single day.""

UK minister Michael Gove previously accused the Scottish Government of seeking ""political conflict"" during the pandemic.

Asked about such accusations, the former Scottish first minister said ""the idea that in those horrendous days, weeks, I was thinking of political opportunity"" was ""not the case"".

Sturgeon also spoke of the impact of the early parts of the pandemic on her personally, saying: ""At times in those early days, I felt overwhelmed by the scale of what we were dealing with and perhaps more than anything, I felt an overwhelming responsibility to do the best I could.""

Sturgeon denied that she ""jumped the gun"" on a decision to ban mass gatherings in March 2020.

She said the Scottish Government was ""perfectly within our rights to take that decision"" and she was ""perfectly within my right"" to announce the decision.

Earlier this week, Michael Gove told the Covid-19 inquiry that he believed Sturgeon had jumped the gun on the move but Sturgeon told the inquiry she would ""counter"" that and that they were ""going more slowly than we should have been"".

She said if she had a regret about the decision, it was that it had not been taken earlier.

The former first minister said: ""Of the many regrets I have, probably chief of those is that we didn't lock down a week, two weeks, earlier than we did.""

Speaking at the UK Covid Inquiry's penultimate session in Scotland on Wednesday, Sturgeon apologised over a pledge she made to release all Covid-era WhatsApps to a public inquiry at a time when she had already deleted messages.

The former first minister said she could have been more ""clear"" in answering a journalist's question at a Covid briefing where she was asked whether an inquiry would have access to all of her communications.

Giving evidence to the UK Covid Inquiry, she said she apologised for any lack of clarity in the answer she gave to Channel 4's Ciaran Jenkins during one of her media briefings in August 2021.

At the time, the former SNP leader said any inquiry would have access to the messages but, in fact, many had been deleted some months previously.

Referring to the exchange in August 2021, inquiry counsel Jamie Dawson KC said: ""(Mr Jenkins) asked specific questions about informal means of communication, including WhatsApps.

""But you knew by that stage that your WhatsApps had been destroyed?""

Sturgeon responded: ""I also knew that anything of any relevance or substance from any of that material would be properly recorded in the Scottish Government system.""

She added: ""I operated from 2007, based on advice, the policy that messages, business relating to government, should not be kept on a phone that could be lost or stolen and insecure in that way, but properly recorded through the system.

""I would want to again underline that communication was extremely limited and would not relate it to matters of substantive government decision-making.""

Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar claimed Sturgeon's answer to Channel 4 amounted to an ""outright lie"".

Sturgeon told the UK Covid Inquiry that she did not use ""informal messaging"" such as WhatsApp to make government decisions during the pandemic.

She said her use of such communications was ""extremely limited"".

She was quizzed over why she deleted WhatsApps with senior government ministers and officials during the course of Covid.

The former SNP leader said the use of WhatsApp had become ""too common a means of communication"" in the Scottish Government.

Sturgeon has faced questions after she admitted that messages were not retained on her own devices. But the former SNP leader has said she retrieved copies of them and sent them to the probe.

She said she deleted informal messages, in line with official advice, and ""salient"" points were all recorded on the corporate record.

She said: ""I operated from 2007, based on advice, the policy that messages, business relating to government should not be kept on a phone that could be lost or stolen and insecure in that way, but properly recorded through the system.""

Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross urged Sturgeon to apologise for ""destroying vital evidence"".

Sturgeon said she was not ""particularly conscious"" of WhatsApp groups where officials were exchanging information.

She said she had ""never seen messages before"" in which Ken Thomson reminded civil servants in the group chat where the ""clear chat"" function was and that ""plausible deniability is my middle name"".

The former first minister said she saw the discussion as ""light-hearted"" and that she would read that as him reminding people to be professional on WhatsApp.

She added that the civil servants in the Covid outbreak group chat were public servants of the ""utmost integrity"".

A number of Scottish Government ministers and officials have said decisions were routinely recorded on the official system even if messages were deleted in line with policy.

But on Tuesday, the inquiry heard that Kate Forbes - who served during the pandemic as finance secretary - was not aware of any deletion policy and retained all her messages.

On Wednesday, Sturgeon said she did not recall receiving an email from Lesley Fraser and Kenneth Thomson about the importance of record retention of material relevant to the work of the inquiry.

Sturgeon was asked by senior counsel to the inquiry, Jamie Dawson, if she recalled receiving that email on August 3 2021.

She answered: ""I do not as far as I am aware, I did not receive that.""

Dawson asked: ""You recall, I would imagine, in a general sense that such a notification was sent out?""

Sturgeon said: ""I would say this: that I don't think I would have required to see that to know that matters that were relevant to know the matters that were relevant.""

The former first minister said she had ""always assumed there would be a public inquiry"".

WhatsApp messages exchanged between Sturgeon and her former chief of staff Liz Lloyd show the former first minister telling Lloyd she was ""having a crisis of decision-making"" over hospitality.

Sturgeon told the inquiry it was something she would have ""preferred not to be"" on the public record.

The messages between Sturgeon and Lloyd show in-depth discussion about what times to allow restaurants to stay open.

Sturgeon wrote: ""I am having a bit of a crisis in decision-making in hospitality, not helped by the fact I haven't slept. The public health argument says stick with 6pm/no alcohol for level 3. But I suspect the industry will go mad - and I worry we could derail debate.""

Sturgeon also said there was ""nothing to show"" that they had listened to industry on the matter.

Current First Minister Humza Yousaf, in his evidence to the inquiry last Thursday, offered an ""unreserved"" apology for the Scottish Government's ""frankly poor"" handling of requests for WhatsApp messages.

He has announced an external review into the Government's use of mobile messaging.","Nicola Sturgeon tells UK Covid Inquiry that a ""large part"" of her wishes she was not first minister during the pandemic were fulfilled.

2024-01-31,McInnes unhappy after talks with referee chief over Ndaba dismissal,"Derek McInnes has been left ""even more disappointed"" after talks with the SFA's referee chief regarding a red card shown to one of his players last week.

The Kilmarnock manager met with Crawford Allan to question Corrie Nbada's sending off in their game against Hibernian at the weekend.

The Rugby Park side were leading 2-1 when the Irishman was sent off for a challenge on Jair Tavares before the game eventually finished 2-2.

Referee Grant Irvine had initially booked the 23-year-old but the yellow card was upgraded to red after a check of the VAR monitor.

McInnes was unhappy at the decision and organised a meeting with Allan to discuss the incident, but was not satisfied with what he heard.

Speaking on Wednesday the Killie boss, who also revealed defender Robbie Deas will be out for the ""next few weeks"" after having an operation on a fractur to his cheekbone, said: ""I was disappointed at the time (of the sending off) and that is still the case.

""I had a conversation with the refereeing department on Monday and I was even more disappointed after that conversation because of the take on it. His explanation was, the justification for the red card.

""They felt the decision was right, rather than a mistake.

""We totally disagreed on the reasons. Without going into it too much, it was more the exiting of the tackle but at least we had the conversation.

""My feeling is that we have to remind ourselves and re-set what VAR was brought in for.

""It has affected what happened on Saturday because it potentially cost us two extra points because we could have won the game, no guarantees of course but it affects us the next two games with Corrie being suspended.

""The referee is three yards away, he is in the heat of the battle and he's seen it for what it was, a yellow card. I didn't think it was a yellow card.

""I will say to you what I said to Crawford Allan and there is no one who will tell me any differently.

""If Corrie gets yellow carded and the game gets played out, there is no one from the Hibs end, or the media, commenting that it was a ridiculous decision, why didn't VAR get involved, why wasn't it a red card? I think they have made it a thing by getting involved.

""Let the referee referee the game. He's seen it for what it was. Give the referees more autonomy and more responsibility.

""I think it was wrong for VAR to get involved. We haven't appealed it. I didn't think there was any real point.""

2024-01-31,Stephen Flynn accuses Tories and Labour of agreeing to 'bleak future' for UK,"Convincing Labour to agree to a ""bleak future"" for the UK is the ""great achievement"" of the Government, Stephen Flynn said.

The SNP Westminster leader told the Commons: ""Scrapping the cap on banker's bonuses was only made possible due to Brexit, so what the Westminster parties are now telling the public is that it is okay for bankers to have unlimited Brexit bonuses, but for the public sitting at home struggling to feed their families they have to suck up and deal with the additional food price costs as a result of Brexit red tape.

""That is the cost and that is the reality of broke Brexit Britain. Isn't it the case that the great achievement of this Tory Government is getting the Labour party to agree to that bleak future?""

Rishi Sunak replied: ""We are actually delivering benefits for people across Scotland, not least in new free trade deals that are opening up markets for Scottish exporters, freeports that are attracting jobs and investments, the Brexit pubs guarantee cutting the cost of a pint in Scottish pubs.

""But when he talks about the cost of living, the thing that he could do most to help is make sure that Scotland isn't the highest taxed part of the United Kingdom. It is not just for high earners, everybody earning £28,500 or more is paying more tax in Scotland than they would in England thanks to the SNP.""

2024-02-01,Wind Farms Are Overstating Their Output  --  And Consumers Are Paying For It,"Dozens of British wind farms run by some of Europe's largest energy companies have routinely overestimated how much power they'll produce, adding millions of pounds a year to consumers' electricity bills, according to market records and interviews with power traders.

These extra costs are linked to a growing problem with Britain's outdated electricity network: On blustery days, too much wind power risks overloading the system, and the grid operator must respond by paying some firms not to generate. This ""curtailment"" costs consumers hundreds of millions of pounds each year.

Adding to that expense, some wind farm operators exaggerate how much energy they say they intend to produce, which boosts the payments they receive for turning off, according to nine people -- traders, academics and market experts -- most of whom agreed to discuss this controversial behavior only on condition of anonymity.

In effect, they said, the grid has paid some wind farms not to generate power that they wouldn't have produced anyway.

Bloomberg News analyzed 30 million records from 2018 through June 2023 to compare wind operators' daily forecasts of the energy they planned to generate to their actual production when they weren't curtailed. Out of 121 wind farms in the analysis, 40 overstated their output by 10% or more on average, and 27 of those overestimated by at least 20%

Electricite de France SA's Fallago Rig wind farm near the Scottish border claimed that it would generate 27.1% more power than it did during the five-and-a-half-year period. Just a few miles away, Fred. Olsen Renewables' Crystal Rig II wind farm said it would produce 35.5% more energy than it delivered. Ventient Energy, backed by JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s asset management arm, overstated the output at its Farr wind farm by 28.7%.

Spokespeople for EDF and Fred. Olsen said in statements that the firms take compliance with market regulations very seriously and work with third-party firms to provide forecasts. Natural Power, a consultant that provides forecasting services to both firms, said it always followed ""industry best practice methodology."" Ventient and JPMorgan declined to comment.

It's impossible to determine precisely how much bill payers have spent due to such overstatements. But assuming a similar rate of overestimation during the times that those 40 farms were paid to stop generating, consumers would have overpaid an estimated £51 million ($65 million) since 2018.

The data analysis by itself does not demonstrate that any individual company purposely exaggerated its output estimates, and wind can be difficult to predict. But forecasting models are increasingly accurate. Indeed, more than half of the wind farms delivered within 5% of what they predicted. What's more, about a quarter of them understated their output.

""If you are systematically overpredicting by a large margin then that is suspicious,"" said Jethro Browell, a senior lecturer at the University of Glasgow and an expert in energy forecasting. ""The average error should be close to zero. They should be underpredicting as often as overpredicting.""

Overstatement has declined recently, but it remains significant. Between 2018 and August 2021, the 40 wind farms that overestimated the most did so by 20%, Bloomberg's analysis found. From September 2021 through June 2023, those same operators overstated by 13%.

UK regulations explicitly prohibit generators from ""obtaining an excessive benefit"" when they are paid to stop or reduce their output due to grid constraints. Other rules stipulate that firms must submit a ""best estimate"" of their generation plans and stick to it as closely as possible.

Former UK Energy Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg said he was shocked by the scale of the overestimation and called on the regulator, which is known as Ofgem, to act urgently. ""I'd like to see Ofgem investigate to see if they can verify Bloomberg's findings,"" said Rees-Mogg, who remains a member of Parliament. ""If they do, I'd like to see them pass a file to prosecutors to establish whether these firms are committing fraud. The government needs to push Ofgem to act.""

Ofgem told Bloomberg that it works closely with the system operator, which monitors ""the behavior of energy market participants to ensure they are following the rules."" Any company found to be deliberately submitting inaccurate forecasts would face a substantial fine, Ofgem said. The regulator declined to comment specifically on Bloomberg's findings.

One energy trader said that exaggerating forecasts was justified because so many firms are doing it. Those that don't, he said, would be at a disadvantage. Also, the trader said, estimating output is imprecise, and it's better financially to err on the side of predicting too much wind.

A senior trader who works at an energy company that rarely gets it wrong had a different perspective. He said there was no legitimate reason why some operators' forecasts were consistently inaccurate while others weren't. Some firms are just more aggressive in seeking to maximize revenue from curtailment, he said.

That trader added that it was dishonest to exaggerate intended output in order to extract additional money from hard-pressed consumers. He was dismayed that regulators hadn't stamped out the practice.

Last winter, as people struggled with the cost of heating their homes amid historic energy inflation, local councils established public ""warm rooms."" During that time, a Bloomberg investigation found, energy company maneuvers added hundreds of millions onto consumers' tabs. Gas plants extracted record prices from Britain's grid, for example, after threatening to turn off supply at times of peak demand.

Energy markets are vulnerable to such gaming when there's a risk that supply won't meet demand, experts say. And as grids around the world increasingly grow dependent on wind and solar power, they're exposed to greater strain when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow. But due to limits in its infrastructure, the UK also faces the opposite problem: too much supply.

Thousands of giant white turbines straddle the lush peat-carpeted hills of the Scottish Highlands and Border regions. Given their dimensions -- typically taller than Big Ben, with three long blades that rhythmically scythe the air -- they are mostly built in remote areas, where land is cheaper and planning restrictions looser. Most are in Scotland, which offers some of the windiest conditions in Europe.

Their output largely flows to population centers in England -- but the system often can't cope with the power surges that occur amid high winds.

This wasn't much of a problem in 2008, when wind generation accounted for less than 2% of British electricity. But wind power has ballooned -- in December it accounted for more than 40% -- and the UK has lagged in expanding its grid to handle the extra load.

Each wind farm files daily estimates of the power it plans to generate. When these indicate there will be too much wind power, the network operator, a unit of National Grid Plc, intervenes and pays generators in the north to switch off. It's a policy meant to incentivize energy firms to build wind turbines without having to worry about losing revenues when the grid can't handle all the energy.

Exaggerated estimates make curtailment more expensive -- and more likely, traders and experts say. Overstatement increases the chance that grid managers will determine that there's a risk of an overload, improving the odds that wind farms will be paid to shut down, they said.

There's an additional cost to curtailment, for both the climate and for consumers. Even as it pays wind farms to curtail their output, the grid operator still needs electricity to meet demand in the south. So, National Grid staff members must pay local gas-fired plants to turn on.

In 2022 alone, those combined payments cost UK bill payers about £800 million and added more than a million tons of carbon emissions into the atmosphere, according to analysis by Carbon Tracker, a not-for-profit think tank that researches investment risks associated with climate change. Its report predicts that without faster infrastructure investments, that number will rise to more than £3.5 billion by 2030.

If they were overstating at a similar rate during the times Fallago Rig was curtailed, its owners would have received an estimated £25,000 in extra compensation.

Scottish Power Ltd.'s Dun Law Wind Farm, which is about seven miles from Fallago, delivered a far more accurate forecast on April 11.

For Fallago Rig, the day wasn't a one-off. The degree of its monthly overstatement during the period examined by Bloomberg fluctuated -- sometimes it was as much as 50% -- but it never dropped below 10%. At its monthly error rate, roughly £9.7 million of the £33.5 million the wind farm has received for curtailment over the past five years would be overpayments.

EDF said that its proprietary data would lead to other conclusions, but declined to provide further information and did not respond to specific questions about April 11. EDF operates Fallago Rig and holds a 20% equity stake. The remainder is owned by a fund managed by Federated Hermes Ltd, which declined to comment.

Other wind farms owned by EDF have also consistently overstated their generation forecasts. One is Dorenell, further north on the famous Glenfiddich Estate. Its projections missed by 26% over the study period. Dorenell's overestimation has declined more recently: From September 2021 through June 2023 it was 14%.

Natural Power, which provides forecasting services for Fallago and Dorenell, said it receives no additional financial benefit based on the amount of compensation its clients collect. The firm said it had never received a query from the regulator relating to the forecast data it has submitted on behalf of its clients.

""The accuracy of these forecasts can be influenced by the site operational data available, which varies according to site and the specifics of the client's contract instructions,"" Natural Power said in a statement.

Ventient's Farr wind farm also systematically overstated its output, some months by more than 50%. In every month analyzed after the first half of 2018, Farr overstated by at least 10%.

""It's very concerning that some of these big energy companies are being rewarded for consistently overstating,"" said Angus MacNeil, a UK lawmaker and the chair of the influential House of Commons energy security and net zero committee. Ofgem should claw that money back, MacNeil said. ""It looks like some operators are gaming the system.""

In 2021, one of the UK's largest wind farms came online: Moray East, run by a consortium called Ocean Winds, led by France's Engie SA and Portugal's EDP Renovaveis SA. Located 13 miles off the northeastern coast of Scotland, Moray can produce as much as 950 megawatts.

It has also exacerbated the grid's congestion in the region, where SSE Plc's Beatrice wind farm already provided nearly 600 megawatts of capacity. The UK's electricity cables can't keep up with all the new generation.

Moray has been curtailed more than any other wind farm since then, pulling in over £100 million, while Beatrice has received more than £58 million. During that span, Moray has been paid to switch off more than a quarter of the time it had intended to run, and Beatrice 17% of the time -- dramatically cutting into the renewable energy they could have offered, Bloomberg found.

For the first 16 months it was running, the staff who operate Moray's 100 turbines understated or accurately forecasted their output, according to Bloomberg's analysis. But starting in September 2022 something changed. That month they overestimated its output by 6.5%. Since then they have tended to overstate -- by 10% in May 2023, for example, and 15% in June, the last month for which Bloomberg has data.

""The UK has a mature electricity market, operated using well-developed regulations and a strong regulator with which Moray East are fully compliant,"" Ocean Winds said in a statement.

Just a few miles away, Beatrice's operators have for the most part filed accurate forecasts, but not always. Between September 2021 and July 2022 they tended to overstate their output by between 6% and 10%. That coincided with periods when their plant was heavily curtailed.

""SSE consistently provides the most accurate estimates we have to the system operator regarding the performance of our wind farms,"" the company said in a statement. ""The real story is that predicting the weather is not an exact science, as everyone knows.""

The UK has a grand vision to more than triple its wind turbines by the end of the decade. But interest rates have skyrocketed and the costs of raw materials such as steel have soared, raising doubts about whether that will come to pass.

Even if it does, unless there is a serious upgrade to the country's transmission system, then the new generation will strain the network even further, driving up the cost of curtailment -- and the incentive to game the system -- even more, experts said.

""We are trying to patch and mend the fact that the location of the renewables generation is not aligned with the grid,"" said Dieter Helm, professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford, and a UK government adviser on energy policy. ""If nothing is done, then this system is going to get even more costly.""","UK wind farms overestimate how much power they'll produce, according to market records.

2024-01-31,Shareholding disclosure: Making complexity manageable | Insights | Bloomberg Professional Services,"Navigate today's complex regulatory landscape. Get insights delivered straight to your inbox.

While having shareholding disclosure is a globally accepted safeguard that national regulators agree needs to be a part of an effective market oversight program, the agreement that this is necessary is where it ends. Since there is no global framework in place, each jurisdiction has its own thresholds at which reporting shareholding disclosure is required.

This means firms must not only know which jurisdiction a company is subject to reporting requirements but also have access to current threshold and shares outstanding data across all relevant jurisdictions. Understanding global compliance to this degree, and achieving it efficiently and easily, is a challenge that many firms both large and small face today.

For example, if you are purchasing shares of Komercni Banka on the Prague stock exchange, acquisition of a position representing one percent of voting shares, or just over 1.9 million shares, will trigger the shareholding disclosure obligation. Meanwhile, if you are investing in Royal Bank of Canada on the Toronto Stock Exchange, you would need to amass a position of approximately 140 million shares before you are obligated to file with the Canadian authorities.

Compounding the complexity is that the type and nature of shares on which the calculation is based also differs between jurisdictions. Investors in United States companies are required to make their reporting determination based on the number of shares that they are holding of a specific asset class. So, although a holder of Alphabet Inc. Class C shares holds no voting rights in the company, a five percent holding of those Class C shares still represent a reportable position. This is counter to most other jurisdictions, which base their reporting requirements off the number of voting shares that are held. As a result, it's vital to understand the total voting rights outstanding for a company and how many are assigned to each share that is held.

Finally, a thorough and accurate understanding of shares outstanding is required to perform the necessary calculations. While some jurisdictions, notably many European ones, prescribe fixed thresholds at which reporting must be done, others rely on the concept of a relative threshold once a certain threshold is crossed. For example, an investor acquiring a reportable position in BHP Group Ltd would need to file documentation with the Australian authorities when they cross the five percent threshold, and all future changes in the position of more than one percent in either direction would trigger new filing obligations. Essentially, firms need to have a comprehensive understanding of their previous filing level and how their current position relates to that point.

Complying with shareholding disclosure requirements is a very data intensive exercise. Firms must understand the current threshold requirements in each jurisdiction in which they trade, aggregate firm positions and current shares outstanding, then combine all these data points to perform timely, accurate monitoring -- a process that firms of all sizes can find challenging.

How can Bloomberg help?

To help clients streamline and keep tabs on various shareholding disclosure requirements, Bloomberg provides a comprehensive Shareholding Disclosure Data Solution available for enterprise-wide use.

2024-01-31,APAC 2024 Regulatory Outlook | Insights | Bloomberg Professional Services,"Navigate today's complex regulatory landscape. Get insights delivered straight to your inbox.

Authorities across the APAC region are engaged on various regulatory initiatives to promote greater investment flow and strengthen financial stability.

Banking regulation

Implementation of the Basel III standards governing bank capital requirements is a key consideration throughout the region. Japan is one of the early leaders in its Basel III implementation effort with capital rules applying first to major banks since March 2023 and then to regional banks from March 2025. For market risk in particular, both Hong Kong and Singapore have confirmed that they will introduce reporting requirements from July 2024 and then the capital adequacy and disclosure requirements from January 2025. Elsewhere, India has issued rules on capital requirements for operational risk and earlier Malaysia's regulator issued a new policy document setting out the standards for credit risk management which came into effect on 1 January 2024.

APAC banking regulators have more on their plate than just new capital requirement rules. For example, Hong Kong is considering changes to simplify its current three-tier structure into a two-tier system with deposit-taking companies falling under the same category as restricted license banks. Australia has finalized new rules to strengthen the crisis preparedness of banks, insurers, and superannuation funds. Australia will also review the treatment of liquid assets and bank liquidity risk, and new requirements will likely take effect from early 2025. Other priorities for Australia's banking regulator in 2024 will include interest rate risk in the banking book, market risk, and improving the effectiveness of additional Tier 1 capital instruments.

Emerging risks

The risks that non-bank financial institutions pose to wider financial stability continues to rise as a prominent regulatory concern, and the Reserve Bank of Australia is actively exploring the risks that emerge from non-traditional, interconnected, and complex parts of the financial sector such as superannuation funds. Similarly, Japan is set to review major banks' exposure to overseas commercial real estate in light of the rapid rise in interest rates and the sensitivity of the sector to this new macroeconomic environment.

Asset management & liquidity

The APAC asset management sector can anticipate further regulatory reform this year. Japan's Government has designated asset management reform as a strategic national priority which includes requiring financial groups to review on asset management business strategy product governance, amongst other plans to encourage market entrants. Malaysia will soon issue final requirements for liquidity risk management to ensure that effective assessment of exposures to liquidity risk. The new requirements will take effect six months after publication. Similarly, New Zealand is due to set out its approach to liquidity policy issues, following industry consultation, such as liquid asset eligibility criteria and stable funding requirements.

Insurance

The rules governing the insurance sector are subject to reform in jurisdictions such as Hong Kong, which has introduced the draft requirements for the risk-based capital regime for the insurance industry. This new regime will render capital requirements more sensitive to their asset and liability matching, risk profile and mix of products. Meanwhile, Singapore has also set out the requirements under the risk-based capital framework for all licensed insurers, including the way in which assets and liabilities are to be valued.

Digital finance

With relatively young and technologically nimble demographics, the APAC financial services sector provides fertile ground for the adoption and testing of new technologies. Regulators across the region are keen to help lead the next phase of digital transformation in financial services through the development of safe but flexible regulatory regimes.

Artificial intelligence

APAC nations are taking an active and leading voice in the global conversation over establishing a regulatory framework for AI. Japan, for example, intentionally used its recent position as Chair of the 2023 G7 Presidency to drive the conversation on AI forward and leans toward a more guidelines-based approach to avoid over-burdening industry. This more light-touch approach to AI regulation is shared by ASEAN member states who are set to soon publish a Guide on AI Governance and Ethics, under Singapore's chairmanship of the ASEAN Digital Ministers' Meeting.

Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission is consulting on guidelines for the use of AI in the financial industry, following the 6 Core Principles and 8 Supporting Policies on the same that had been published in 2023. Singapore's regulator, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), released an open-source toolkit to enable the responsible use of AI in the financial industry, known as the Veritas Toolkit 2.0. This represents the first responsible AI toolkit developed specifically for financial services and is designed to help financial institutions assess the application of principles such as fairness, ethics, accountability, and transparency. MAS, in collaboration with a consortium of industry participants via Project MindForge, will also be soon publishing a whitepaper setting out private sector perspective for the responsible use of generative AI.

Data protection and cross-border data flows

Various APAC jurisdictions are beginning to tighten their laws on the flow of data across borders. India's recently finalized Digital Personal Data Protection Bill permits cross-border data transfers except to specifically ""blacklisted countries"", which remain to be decided. Moreover, India's financial regulators have mandated that regulated firms will have to ensure that their data is stored in India. Further details on what this means in practice will be revealed this year when India's market regulator finalises the Consolidated Cyber Security and Cyber Resilience Framework.

Rules issued a year ago by Indonesia's financial services authority shine a spotlight on the protection of consumers' data within regulated financial-technology businesses. Commercial banks are required to locate their electronic system data centres and disaster recovery centres within Indonesia. Banks may only have overseas data centres after obtaining agreement from the regulator.

Data flows between Mainland China and the Hong Kong-Guangdong-Macau Greater Bay Area are set to develop following the memorandum of understanding signed between Hong Kong's Innovation, Technology & Industry Bureau and China's Cyberspace Administration. In the medium term, it remains to be seen what implications this would have for data flows from Hong Kong overseas, given mainland China's stringent data protection and localization requirements.

Markets and trading

APAC regulators are seeking to develop the region's capital markets through introducing various reforms to the rules governing securities trading.

Market and trade surveillance

Improving trade execution quality, transparency, and market integrity remains a top priority for APAC regulators as they look to build public confidence and promote investor protection.

Surveillance is fast becoming a hot-issue in India with the markets regulator recently consulting on whether to require broking firms to make their senior management accountable for the detection and prevention of fraud and market abuse by setting up surveillance and control systems. They also proposed a similar proposal for asset management companies. More clarity will come this year once final rules are published.

Recent reforms to Japan's best execution policy continue to bed in one year after their introduction in January 2023. Specifically, firms are now required to take a price-oriented approach to orders from retail investors by comparing quotes and transaction costs offered by alternative trading venues and traditional exchanges, for example. If smart order routing is used, it is mandatory for firms to add the purpose and principles of SOR-based order execution to their policy to enhance transparency.

In Singapore, the Trade Surveillance Practice Guide published by the regulator and Singapore Exchange Regulation urged brokers to consider adopting automated surveillance systems, AI and machine learning to enhance monitoring of trading activities. The rise in volume and complexity of trades has led to changes in the way market and trade surveillance is conducted, with increasing momentum for using automation and innovative technology to achieve best practice.

OTC derivatives reporting

APAC jurisdictions have undertaken changes to their over-the-counter derivatives reporting requirements to foster greater international harmonization and mirror much of Europe's EMIR Refit. The Japan FSA finalised their OTC derivatives reporting requirements in December 2023, requiring mandatory reporting of the UTI (unique transaction identifier), CDE (critical data elements), LEI (legal entity identifier), and specify that the ISO 20022 XML message format must be used. These rules come in force from April 2024. New OTC derivatives reporting rules including the UPI will come into force in Singapore and Australia in October 2024, and Hong Kong sometime later in 2025.

The growth of new fields to be reported and differences between global jurisdictions represents a challenge for firms. With manual reporting of trades becoming increasingly unfeasible, these rules changes are spurring greater automation for regulatory reporting.

Accelerated T+1 settlement

The accelerated T+1 settlement conversation has made its way to APAC, with India leading the way by transitioning to T+1 settlement for equities in 2023 and working toward instant settlements (T+0).

Besides India, other APAC regulators have yet to take a stance on whether they will shorten the settlement cycle. This has not stopped industry participants from considering the impact that this change in the US would have on APAC and whether the region's market structure is ready for it. This conversation will gain greater traction in the year ahead, with regulators engaging industry stakeholders for input and dialogue.

China market opening-up

China will continue to open up its onshore financial markets, approve more foreign financial institutions to establish wholly owned regulated entities, and ease operations in China. The main initiatives include repo connect in the interbank bond market and preparing for China treasury bond futures contracts to launch in Hong Kong which will have far-reaching impact on Chinese financial markets.

Green finance

Countries across the APAC region are making significant headway with the development of new rules and initiatives to facilitate the green transition.

Green transition and standard

Work is underway to finalise guidance on financing the early retirement of coal-fired power plants in the region, which is a key priority for the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero Asia-Pacific Network. This initiative comes as coal power generation continues to rise in Asia and represents the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions globally.

As a sign of growing Asian leadership of the green finance agenda, both Japan and Hong Kong hosted GFANZ country chapters in 2023 and Japan is expected to issue the first government climate transition bond early this year.

Having launched its Finance for Net Zero action plan, MAS will soon develop transition guidance for the industry to help guide Asia's net zero transition. This follows MAS having issued its fourth and final consultation on detailed thresholds and criteria for financing the early phase-out of coal-fired power plants.

The Sustainability Standards Board of Japan will issue draft standards by end-March 2024 to implement and develop Japanese sustainability disclosure standards that are aligned with the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). Similarly, the Australian Accounting Standards Board will soon consult on detailed disclosure standards. Regulators in Hong Kong are preparing for the implementation of disclosure standards for listed companies from January 2025.

Disclosures

India continues to move toward the development a comprehensive ESG regulatory framework that covers disclosure requirements for listed entities, ESG ratings, and ESG investing by mutual funds. In particular, ESG ratings are a growing regulatory theme across the region with Singapore having issued a draft industry code of conduct for providers of ESG ratings and data products to embed best practices. Similarly, Hong Kong has also begun industry discussions to draft a voluntary code of conduct for ESG ratings and data products.

Mandatory climate reporting rules in New Zealand are due to take effect in early 2024 and the country's financial regulator has issued guidance to help firms meet obligations under the new disclosure regime. Australia's mandatory climate reporting regime will kick in from July 2024 and new disclosure standards will apply in South Korea from February 2024, requiring ESG funds to explain how the investment process incorporates ESG elements.

Singapore's Sustainability Reporting Advisory Committee recommended last year that all listed issuers should be required to report ISSB-aligned disclosures from fiscal year 2025 and non-listed companies with SGD $1 billion or more in revenue from FY 2027.

Taxonomy

Green taxonomy development remains a major theme across the APAC region. Hong Kong has set out its approach to developing a taxonomy to provide a local green classification framework while Singapore and China have established a green finance taskforce to strengthen the interoperability between their taxonomies.

Having already published the first phase of the country's taxonomy on sustainable finance, Thailand is set to employ a traffic light system that distinguishes between green, amber (transitional) and red activities. The second phase of the Thailand taxonomy will focus on manufacturing, agriculture, real estate, construction and waste management. Singapore has launched the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy which helps to define green and transition activities that contribute to climate change mitigation across eight focus sectors. The MAS will soon produce a comparison of the Singapore Taxonomy, EU Taxonomy and Common Ground Taxonomy.

Climate risk

Managing climate risk continues to present challenges in the APAC region, and the Reserve Bank of India is developing guidance to manage climate risks through a three-pillar approach encompassing green deposits, a disclosure framework, and stress-testing guidance.

New Zealand is encouraging financial institutions to develop their scenario analysis capability and improve governance through the development of new guidance for managing climate-related risks. Meanwhile, Australia is implementing its second climate vulnerability study which will focus on insurance to help the industry understand the impact of climate risks. In Malaysia, new principles and requirements for climate risk management have just come into effect in December 2023.

Hong Kong has published guidelines to enhance the second round of climate risk stress testing, with over 30 firms confirmed to participate in the stress test this year.

2024-01-31,AI Is Helping Pick What You'll Wear in Two Years,"Fashion forecasters are leveraging artificial intelligence to make decisions about the trends and styles you'll be scrambling to wear.

There's a group of people who could have told you that 2023 was going to be the year of Barbie pink before anyone else. And those ""quiet luxury"" fashions everyone was clamoring for with the end of Succession? They saw it coming from a mile away. These are the trend forecasters, people whose job is to distill the public's mood and identify demand before the rest of us even know what we're going to want. They hold their secrets close to the vest and for a hefty fee share insights into the future with their clients. The more accurately retailers and brands call trends, the more money they'll make -- and in the US, retail is already a $540 billion a year industry. It's a tricky endeavor, and technology such as artificial intelligence and social media is changing how forecasting behemoths like NellyRodi and WGSN do their business.

For decades, trend forecasting was in the hands of a few people in the fashion industry. Editors at the likes of Harper's Bazaar and Vogue dictated styles from their pages -- just think back to the ode to Diana Vreeland in Funny Face or the Anna Wintour character in The Devil Wears Prada. Marketing men on Madison Avenue controlled the advertising messages. Then came the smartphone, social media, bloggers, livestreaming and other tech that made fashion more visible -- and calling trends more volatile. Today computers do a lot of the work.","Fashion forecasters are leveraging artificial intelligence to make decisions about trends.

2024-01-31,Why China's Xi is Pushing 'High-Quality Development',"When China's economy was finally unshackled from the world's strictest Covid-19 controls in late 2022, hopes were high that it would roar back to help power global growth. Instead, the country has faced a confluence of problems: a property crisis, flagging exports, sluggish consumer spending and towering local government debt. The risk of a Japan-style deflationary malaise has led to an exodus of foreign capital, but President Xi Jinping has been unwilling to pull out the big stimulus guns. Some of that reluctance stems from a desire to promote the high-tech and green industries of the future, and avoid another bout of unsustainable, debt-fueled growth. A phrase that's cropped up in many of Xi's recent speeches seems to sum up his approach: ""high-quality development.""

The term is considered to underscore the quality of economic growth instead of the absolute pace. When Xi first used the term during a key party congress in 2017, he said China's economy is transitioning away from a ""high-speed growth phase."" He highlighted the importance of lifting productivity and improving the structure of the economy, as he called for more efficient and sustainable development. An analysis of Communist Party publications since then shows that progress in six key areas is often cited as required, including making the economy greener, more innovated and balanced.",President Xi Jinping has been unwilling to pull out the big stimulus guns.

Like an increasing number of economic observers, Taleb says the cause of this calamity-in-plain-sight is the federal budget deficit. He says it's swelling by such an extent that it would take a miracle to duck the damage that's on the way. And he's not alone. Taleb joined former US Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and BlackRock Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand in sounding the alarm over consequences stemming from exploding debt -- let alone default -- and what that could mean for the dollar's global status. ""So long as you have Congress keep extending the debt limit and doing deals because they're afraid of the consequences of doing the right thing...eventually you're going to have a debt spiral,"" Taleb said. ""And a debt spiral is like a death spiral.""

Still, given the scale of the Covid-19 price shocks and the interest-rate hikes that followed, the IMF suggested things could have gone much worse. ""The global economy continues to display remarkable resilience, and we are now in the final descent toward a soft landing with inflation declining steadily and growth holding up,"" IMF Chief Economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said.

2024-02-01,Opinion: Why I'm going to keep teaching the truth about racism in America | CNN,"""As an academic institution, (Harvard) should be leading the resistance to assaults on higher education, not bowing to them,"" writes Khalil Gibran Muhammad.

Editor's Note: Khalil Gibran Muhammad is the Ford Foundation Professor of History, Race and Public Policy at Harvard University, an organizer of the Freedom to Learn movement and co-host of the Some of My Best Friends Are podcast. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.

CNN --

Black History Month, which gets underway this week, is a chance to give Americans the timely reminder that you can't teach our history honestly without understanding Black struggle and triumph.

Khalil Gibran Muhammad Institutional Antiracism and Accountability Project at Harvard Kennedy School

Take race and racism out of the American story and very little about the country is comprehensible. The way we elect our presidents. The civil rights enshrined in the 14th Amendment that gives birthright citizenship to formerly excluded Asian immigrants and grants marriage equality to same-sex couples. The nation's intergenerational wealth accumulated during 350 years of slavery and segregation. And the outsize cultural visibility of African American creative talent on the world stage.

Because Black patriots have carried the flame of American democracy for everyone, and for centuries, Black people continue to be overrepresented in pro-democracy movements in the United States -- the very movements that some people, particularly some top Republicans and leading figures on the right -- seek so desperately to destroy in their zeal to pass voter suppression laws and their efforts to diminish freedom of speech and assembly rights.

Nowhere are these attacks more evident right now than on college campuses. Many academics who teach about the history of race and racism in America, as I do, are being unjustifiably blamed for the rise in antisemitism on campus and falsely accused of creating racial divisions in the country. This has had the undesirable effect of putting us in the crosshairs of some of the most powerful people in the country, including Republican politicians, conservative activists and billionaire donors.

Last week, at my alma mater the University of Pennsylvania, about 100 faculty rallied against what they decried as ""anti-democratic"" attacks on diversity, academic freedom and free speech. Faculty and staff at private universities across the country now face a similar plight, as do many teachers, librarians and academics at public colleges and universities who have been censored, harassed, physically threatened and fired for doing their jobs over the past year.

As these dangerous assaults move to private universities, many academics are preparing for the worst. I count myself among them. Last year, for the first time in my 25-year career as an academic historian, my teaching was singled out by a powerful politician for causing hate.

When GOP Rep. Virginia Foxx opened the December 5 congressional hearing about antisemitism on campus, she targeted a class taught by me as a ""prime example"" of a ""race-based ideology"" that has caused Harvard University to be ""ground zero for antisemitism following October 7."" Foxx also cited two additional campus examples of ""institutional antisemitism and hate"" -- a Global Health seminar on ""Scientific Racism and Anti-Racism"" and an initiative at the Harvard Divinity School on ""Social and Racial Justice.""

Then, on January 2, just hours after Claudine Gay announced her resignation under pressure Foxx promised to keep her congressional investigation into Harvard going because ""postsecondary education,"" the lawmaker wrote in a statement, has been hijacked by ""political activists, woke faculty and partisan administrators.""

If by ""woke"" Foxx means teaching the truth about American history, then I'm guilty as charged. There are few aspects of America's past that haven't been impacted by conscientious Black people and their resistance to systemic racism and illiberal democracy.

The charge against me of promulgating a ""race-based ideology"" that fosters antisemitic views is especially preposterous since the coursework I teach on the history of anti-Jewish hatred and discrimination shows how Blacks and Jews have common enemies in neo-Nazis, replacement theorists and white domestic terrorists in the US. Members of these same groups frequently voice support for the current leader of the Republican Party, former President Donald Trump, who has employed language that resembles the rhetoric of Adolph Hitler.

Right-wing office holders targeting academics is the latest battlefront in a three-year-old political war on education that started with Trump's ban on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) training in federal agencies, and then metastasized to numerous states criminalizing books and curricula on racism, gender discrimination and sexuality in public primary and secondary schools. Florida recently banned sociology from the core curriculum of the nation's largest public university system, which serves 430,000 students, because ""it has been hijacked by left-wing activists,"" according to the state commissioner of education.

Foxx and her political ilk want people to believe that what happens in my classroom and the classrooms of many other academics across the country is a part of a woke conspiracy meant to indoctrinate White Americans to hate themselves and their country. They want the public to believe that those of us who teach the truth about the history of race and racism are the real racists and antisemites in America, as these or the enemies of racial progress and democracy attempt to stand reality on its head.

The situation at Harvard has been made more dire by the university's failure to push back sufficiently against broader political attacks. In his first university statement as interim president, Alan Garber issued a broad affirmation of the university's commitment to ""free inquiry and expression, in a climate of inclusion and mutual respect."" But as the new semester got underway in January, there was no written statement by senior university officials assuring faculty who teach about racism or staff who hold various functions in the area of DEI that we are safe to do our jobs.

Boilerplate assurances of academic freedom were commonplace before Gay became president and certainly were issued frequently before October 7, when antisemitism became weaponized against anyone teaching about racism or colonialism or who dared to speak about the history of Israel's occupation of Gaza. And to be clear, I mean anyone -- not just Black faculty. Just last week, on the first day of the spring semester, President Garber came under fire for appointing Derek J. Penslar, a prolific and well-respected scholar of Jewish history, to be the co-chair of Harvard's reconstituted presidential task force combating antisemitism.

Penslar is accused of being soft on antisemitism by Bill Ackman, the billionaire donor who says DEI is the ""root cause"" of Harvard's alleged antisemitism and is a prominent supporter of Foxx's congressional investigation. Another vocal critic of Penslar is the former Harvard president Lawrence Summers, who was also an outspoken opponent of Gay's. He wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter) that Penslar's views are disqualifying because he has invoked ""the concept of settler colonialism in analyzing Israel"" and has labeled it ""an apartheid state.""

The tragedy is that the academics most committed to learning from the past -- who have dedicated their entire careers to staring into the abyss of oppression, in an effort to teach the concept of ""Never Again"" and how it applies to all people -- are the ones least protected in this moment. Black faculty and staff feel especially vulnerable. As my friend who is a Black staffer at a Florida community college told me recently: ""I am on the opposite end of the educational spectrum than Harvard, but our realities are the same in many respects.""

Some Black colleagues on my campus have told me they are concerned about the risk to the careers and reputation of ""teaching while Black"" in this climate. Even some Black alumni are weighing whether it is safe to speak up about Gay's swift demise as Harvard's first Black woman president, especially in light of what was believed by many of us to be a political hit job for her commitment to DEI. ""People are afraid,"" one alum told me. ""If it can happen to her, it can happen to any of us.""

If the oldest, richest and most powerful American university won't defend its own people and resist political efforts to interfere with unvarnished truth-telling and academic freedom, then shame on Harvard. As an academic institution, we should be leading the resistance to these assaults on higher education, not bowing to them.

Silence is a failure of leadership in times like these. Harvard, with its motto ""Veritas"" -- truth -- owes it to all of us on the frontlines of these false attacks to defend us for teaching and practicing the very values it claims to uphold.

And for those of us who believe that a rigorous, equitable, inclusive and above all else honest education is the only kind worth having in a multi-racial democracy, we must be courageous, stand together and continue teaching the truth.","Khalil Gibran Muhammad is Ford Foundation Professor of History, Race and Public Policy.

2024-02-01,Liverpool striker Darwin Núñez continues to split opinion after setting unwanted Premier League record in Reds' 4-1 win | CNN,"Darwin Núñez has proved to be a polarizing figure since joining Liverpool in 2022.

CNN --

Since joining Liverpool in 2022, Darwin Núñez has continued to be an entertaining, yet polarizing presence in the English Premier League.

On one hand, the 24-year-old has all the physical attributes to be a world-class striker. He's fast, strong and has shown signs he can score from almost anywhere when in the mood.

But the Uruguayan is also raw and many question whether he has the technical ability to be a consistent threat at the very top of the sport.

This juxtaposition was on full display in Livepool's league win against Chelsea on Wednesday, where Núñez missed a penalty, made a wonderful assist and then set an unwanted record.

While the Reds won 4-1, the scoreline could have been even more emphatic had Núñez not hit the woodwork on four occasions - a Premier League record for a single game.

Two of those missed chances were brilliant efforts from the striker, but the other two were opportunities he really should have converted.

The first was a missed penalty just before half-time which, despite hitting well, he directed against the post. The second was a stooping header in the second half which really should have been a goal.

Despite the missed chances, Núñez did pop up with a brilliant assist for Luis Díaz who made it 4-1 to the six-time European champions.

When asked about his striker's performance after the game, Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp tried to put a positive spin on it.

""Think you are in his boots, how that feels. Missing a penalty, you could see it at half-time, he was really upset with himself. Then missing the header from close range, but then setting up a goal. He stays in the game,"" Klopp told reporters.

""It is just crazy that he creates that many [chances]. Imagine for a second he would take them all, the numbers would be absolutely insane to the extent where you wouldn't understand it anymore.""

According to the Premier League, Núñez now leads the way in big chances missed this season (20), three more than Manchester City's Erling Haaland, who sits in second.

The Liverpool forward also taken the most shots, been caught offside the most times and hit the woodwork more than any other player in the league this season.

Agent of chaos

Despite his lack of cutting edge in front of goal, Liverpool fans have seemingly taken to the striker, serenading him with chants throughout the game against Chelsea.

""I thought he did everything but score a goal. He will be a nightmare for [defenders] to play against, whether he scores or not,"" pundit and former Manchester United star Rio Ferdinand told TNT Sports after the match.

""He runs you into bad places, he's aggressive, he ricochets everything [...] he's a handful who will end up getting goals at this club.""

With seven league goals to his name so far this season, Núñez has undoubtedly been a pivotal part of his team's rise to the top of the Premier League - it now sits five places ahead of Manchester City in second, having played one game more.

If Liverpool is going to see off the title challenge from the reigning league champion, it will need to rely on the likes of Núñez to keep finding the back of the net.

Whether he can do that is yet to be seen, but Liverpool fans will certainly enjoy their agent of chaos either way.","Darwin Nez has continued to be an entertaining, yet polarizing presence in the English Premier League.

2024-02-01,"Rosenwald Schools educated generations of Black Americans. Now, graduates are fighting to preserve the classrooms and their legacy. | CNN","A classroom in the old Mount Sinai Junior High School, a ""Rosenwald School,"" that was built for rural Black Americans during the Jim Crow era near Prattville, Alabama.

CNN --

Maudy Adkinson Johnson remembers walking across cow fields and busy roads as a child to get to her one-room schoolhouse in Spring Hill, Tennessee.

It was the 1950s, and Johnson said the Lee-Buckner School was teaching her how to read, write and do math problems. She was also making friends with other Black children.

Never once did she question why there were no White students at her school - instead, she said students were more focused on their education and building a sense of community.

""We never even talked about it being a difference in the races,"" Johnson said. ""We didn't understand it.""

But whether the students knew it or not, Lee-Buckner was part of the Rosenwald Schools project -- a broad effort to educate Black children in the rural South at a time when segregation prohibited them from attending White schools.

Julius Rosenwald, a philanthropist and president of Sears, Roebuck and Company, launched the project in partnership with Black American orator and president of the Tuskegee Institute, Booker T. Washington.

Rosenwald, his nonprofit, The Rosenwald Fund, and members of the Black community raised funding for the construction of more than 5,000 schools, teacher homes and shops between 1912 and 1932, according to the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

But following the Supreme Court's 1954 ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, which desegregated schools across the United States, there was less of a need for Rosenwald schools, said Rachael Finch, a historian and preservation consultant for the Heritage Foundation of Williamson County in Tennessee.

Many of the schools became vacant and faced demolition over the years, Finch said, adding roughly 10% of the schools are still standing today.

Among them is Lee-Buckner, which is scheduled to be moved by a tractor-trailer this week from Spring Hill to the Franklin Grove Estate & Gardens -- a landmark historic site in downtown Franklin, Tennessee.

The Heritage Foundation of Williamson County is developing the site with a $35 million capital campaign, said Bari Beasley, president and CEO of the foundation. The site will open in 2025 for tourists, school field trips and local resident memberships, she said.

Beasley said the organization plans to restore and transform Lee-Buckner into a historic monument.

Former Lee-Buckner students also helped the Heritage Foundation draw renderings of where desks and other furniture were placed when they attended the school, so the room can be recreated, Beasley said.

Beasley said Lee-Buckner remains a critical piece of Black history that needs to be preserved and taught, especially amid ongoing efforts by some conservative lawmakers to limit or change Black history lessons in schools.

""I don't think you can truly be authentic without telling the whole story,"" Beasley said. ""And to be able to talk about it and have difficult conversations helps us all understand the world around us and how to make the world a better place.""

Finch said the Lee-Bucker school is a national treasure because it symbolizes the resilience of Black Americans. After the Civil War and during the Jim Crow era, Finch said there was a movement of newly-freed Black slaves working to build churches, cemeteries and schools for their communities.

If their community didn't have a schoolhouse, many Black children would study and learn in their living rooms, front yards, fields and church pews, according to the National Park Service.

Rosenwald Schools, Finch said, played a major role in expanding educational access for Black youth.

""These schools became beacons of hope,"" Finch said. ""One thing that African Americans craved and sought after the Civil War was access to education because access to education meant knowledge and power ... to be able to propel oneself into place of prominence through owning a business, having a home, owning land.""

The Rosenwald Schools have notably educated prominent civil rights activists including the late Congressman John Lewis, poet Maya Angelou and Medgar Evers, a civil rights activist who was assassinated in Jackson, Mississippi, in 1963.

But after schools across the US were ordered to desegregate, many of the Rosenwald schools became vacant and faced demolition.

""They became shadows and shells of the past,"" Finch said. ""But that doesn't mean the community forgot.""

Roy Brown, who attended Lee-Buckner from around 1954 to 1963, said the school was a staple in his close-knit community growing up.

Brown, 74, said he studied math, English, history and social studies at Lee-Bucker. He also recalled going outside to collect wood for fire to heat the school during the winter months.

""We had an opportunity through the founders of Rosenwald schools to learn what we would have never been taught at home,"" Brown said.

Now a retired Franklin police officer, Brown said he is thankful that Lee-Buckner is being preserved by the Heritage Foundation of Williamson County.

""It shouldn't be neglected,"" he said, adding that the history and significance of schools like Lee-Buckner should be taught. ""Whether you're White or Black, you should learn about this history.""

Johnson, who is now a local pastor, said she keeps in touch with many of her classmates from Lee-Buckner. She said she is excited the Heritage Foundation of Williamson County is saving Lee-Buckner and not allowing it to be demolished.

Johnson said she takes pride in this part of Black history.

""Not just because we had our own school,"" she said. ""But it gave us a chance (to learn) ... a chance that we would not have had any other way.""",Lee-Buckner School was built for rural Black Americans during the Jim Crow era.

2024-02-01,'Argylle' delivers a mix of action and laughs that's fit for a Kingsman | CNN,"CNN --

After a trio of ""Kingsman"" movies, director Matthew Vaughn essentially hits the reset button with ""Argylle,"" another fun, highly stylized and less violent spy movie. Cast to the hilt, the film proves inventively twisty if a little convoluted, with the modest disclaimer that it's not as good as the trailer makes it look.

Without getting into the details so as to avoid spoilers, suffice it to say that ""Argylle"" turns out to be less derivative of ""Romancing the Stone"" than the initial concept might suggest. Granted, both that 1984 movie and this one feature a successful but perhaps mousy author being confronted with the exotic (and dangerous) adventures about which she's written, but the similarities pretty much end there.

Said author, Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), is introduced at an event for the fourth book in her ""Argylle"" series, which features a namesake spy (Henry Cavill) dealing with fabulous, globetrotting, James Bond-style threats, facing off against an evil foe (Dua Lipa, making the most of limited screen time) and flanked by a hulking sidekick (John Cena).

Despite her action-filled books, Elly prefers to stay home with her cat (who, if billed fairly, would be the movie's third lead), even bringing him along in a backpack when she boards a train to visit her mom (Catherine O'Hara). Before getting there, though, she's intercepted by a less-brawny version of her literary hero named Aidan (Sam Rockwell), who gives her the equivalent of the ""Come with me if you want to live"" line and whisks her off into a world that mirrors the one in her books.

Why is Elly being targeted? Thanks to the screenplay by Jason Fuchs (""Pan""), that comes out gradually, with a whole lot of action in between, and a lineup of costars that includes Bryan Cranston, Ariana DeBose, Sofia Boutella and Samuel L. Jackson (a ""Kingsman"" alum).

As Elly's guide on this overwhelming journey, Rockwell steals the show, presenting a more human-scale spy who still does amazing things with smart-alecky wit and bravado. Cavill, meanwhile, serves as a shrewd addition in a supporting role given his association with the genre (see ""Mission: Impossible"" and ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E."") when not wearing a cape.

Produced for Apple TV+, which has invested heavily in prestige movies like ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" and ""Napoleon,"" ""Argylle"" is receiving a robust theatrical release seemingly designed, smartly, to capitalize on the cast and trailer during playoff football.

As noted, Vaughn's work stands out for its energetic and playful approach to action, which is very much in evidence here. That said, this represents a bit of a rebound after his defining run with ""Kick-Ass,"" ""X-Men: First Class"" - one of the best entries in that series - and ""Kingsman"" gave way to that last film's less worthy sequel and prequel.

Consumed on its unassuming terms, ""Argylle"" is undeniably fun. Because while you might not be able to judge one of Elly's books by its cover, as far as what the movie aims to deliver, you pretty much can.

2024-02-01,"First on CNN: To 'meet people where they are,' HHS to allow opioid disorder treatment via telemedicine, at home | CNN","HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra, left, hosts a discussion with youth leaders from the drug abuse prevention group CADCA on Wednesday.

CNN --

Some people being treated for opioid use disorders can soon take home doses of their methadone medications or schedule telehealth appointments in ways they haven't always been able to do before.

For the first time in more than two decades, the US Department of Health and Human Services is making significant updates to regulations governing Opioid Treatment Programs or OTP, certified and accredited programs that provide medications such as methadone or buprenorphine for people diagnosed with an opioid use disorder. These are the only certified programs through which people can access methadone treatment, a medication approved to treat opioid use disorder by reducing cravings and withdrawal and blunting or blocking the effects of opioids.

A final rule, scheduled to publish Friday, will update the OTP regulations. The updates include expanding eligibility for patients to take home doses of their methadone treatment, allowing them to start treatment via telehealth and allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to order medications.

These updates are intended to ""meet people where they are,"" HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said, and to make treatments more accessible.

""If you are trying to take care of your family, get a new job, maybe go back to school and stay in recovery, being able to access treatment via telemedicine, that's just a basic thing that makes a difference in somebody's life to help them stay well,"" said Rachel Pryor, counselor to the secretary.

""Being able to take home doses of methadone so that you don't have to go back and forth to a methadone clinic every single day, that helps you keep your job and get your life back,"" she said. ""We're just trying to help people keep their lives together.""

Becerra has heard firsthand how quickly a life can spin out of control. On Wednesday, he met with four young people, through the drug abuse prevention organization CADCA, who have been affected by the nation's ongoing substance use crisis.

LaDarrick Smith, a student at Morehouse College in Atlanta, told Becerra about a friend who started vaping at a young age and then started using drugs and is now in prison. They still stay in touch, Smith said, and his friend never intended for his life to spiral that way.

""We have to do more to catch folks before they get out of control, and out of control could be, in this case, prison for his friend, or it could be overdose and maybe dying,"" Becerra said. ""To do that, we have to know how to better reach people.""

'A historic modernization'

During the Covid-19 pandemic, regulations were relaxed around using telemedicine for the treatment of opioid use disorders, Pryor said, and the latest updates to the OTP regulations make these telemedicine options permanent.

""This final rule represents a historic modernization of OTP regulations to help connect more Americans with effective treatment for opioid use disorders,"" said Dr. Miriam Delphin-Rittmon, HHS assistant secretary for mental health and substance use and leader of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration or SAMHSA, in a written statement.

""While this rule change will help anyone needing treatment, it will be particularly impactful for those in rural areas or with low income for whom reliable transportation can be a challenge, if not impossible,"" she said. ""In short, this update will help those most in need.""

Access to medications for opioid use disorder has been an ongoing issue for people in the United States, said Dr. Noa Krawczyk, an assistant professor in the Department of Population Health at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine and a member of the Center for Opioid Epidemiology and Policy, who is not involved with HHS.

The latest efforts by officials to expand access to treatment are ""great,"" Krawczyk said, but there is still more work to be done to ensure that both harm reduction tools and medications are accessible for those who need them the most. For instance, not all US counties have an Opioid Treatment Program, she said, and these geographic disparities affect access.

""Historically, how medications for opioid use disorder have been regulated has made them very difficult to proliferate. For example, methadone, which is the most evidence-based treatment that we've had since the '70s, is very restricted. In the US, you can only get it through an Opioid Treatment Program right now, a special clinic that has very distinct licensing and which is not available in most counties,"" Krawczyk said.

""There's a lot of stigma against these medications,"" she said. ""People have a negative notion around methadone. They think that if you're on one of these medications, you're replacing one drug for another, which is a very big myth, since they're extremely effective and help people achieve a lot of different goals, including staying alive.""

More testing for 'very scary' drug

The final rule that updates the OTP regulations is the latest in a string of actions that the Biden-Harris administration has taken recently to battle the nation's ongoing overdose epidemic.

HHS also announced Thursday that certain federal grant funds now can be used to purchase test strips for xylazine, an animal sedative commonly known as tranq. This means grant recipients -- such as local health departments, first responders or health systems -- can use the funding to purchase xylazine test strips as tools to help prevent overdose and other drug-related harms.

""We want communities to be able to have resources to purchase these test strips so that individuals will know what's going on in their drug supply,"" said Capt. Christopher Jones, director of the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention at SAMHSA.

Test strips to detect whether fentanyl is present within recreational drugs are commonly used, and xylazine test strips are becoming more widely available. Fentanyl is a powerful synthetic opioid that is about 100 times more potent than morphine and 50 times more potent than heroin. Xylazine is not an opioid but rather a sedative that's commonly used in veterinary medicine.

""In 2021, we made it clear that fentanyl test strips were an allowable use for these grantees. What we are making public is that xylazine test strips are also an allowable use for these grantees,"" Pryor said. ""Xylazine is a very scary thing that is out there today on the streets with fentanyl.""

When xylazine is added to fentanyl products or other drugs, it can increase the risk of an overdose.

""Xylazine, because it adds a sedative effect, it adds to what the opioids already do in terms of slowing down breathing and having a risk for an overdose. It can lengthen or strengthen that effect, so it is more dangerous,"" Krawczyk said. ""This is definitely an emerging issue that we need to learn and do much more about in terms of trying to get test strips out and educate people about how to address xylazine in the drug supply and medically.""

The White House has declared fentanyl laced with xylazine to be an emerging threat facing the United States. A report published last year by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that, among 21 jurisdictions, the monthly share of fentanyl overdose deaths where xylazine was detected climbed from about 3% of deaths in January 2019 to nearly 11% in June 2022 - representing almost a four-fold increase.

Overall, the number of overdose deaths associated with any drug continues to increase each month in the United States, though the pace appears to be slowing. Deaths reached a record high in May and have changed little in the following months, through August.

According to provisional data from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, more than 112,000 people died from a drug overdose in the 12-month period ending in August.

""Drug overdoses reach every corner of our society, taking lives and causing immeasurable pain to families and communities. That's exactly why President Biden made it a key priority of his Unity Agenda. We have made important progress, but there is still a lot of work to do,"" Becerra said in a written statement.

""But we have the tools, evidence-based strategies, and shared commitment across our nation to take on the overdose epidemic,"" he said. ""HHS is focused on the full range of solutions needed to address substance use. We will continue to use every lever available to tackle this and save lives. That includes a focus on prevention, as well as expanding treatment and engagement with those struggling with substance use disorder.""

Earlier this week, HHS -- through SAMHSA -- released an updated toolkit on how to prevent and respond to overdoses. The latest version of the Overdose Prevention and Response Toolkit has appendices for specific audiences, including people who use drugs, people who take prescription opioids, first responders and health care practitioners.

The hope is for these latest HHS actions, including the final rule for Opioid Treatment Programs, to drive down overdose death rates, Jones said.

""When we're looking at over 110,000 overdose deaths, we have to pull all the levers that we have to drive down overdoses, and medication treatment for opioid use disorder is one of the strongest evidence-based practices we have,"" he said. ""We know it can reduce risk for dying by 50%. And so this rule is modernizing how we provide medication treatment in Opioid Treatment Programs so that more people can get access.""","HHS is making significant updates to regulations governing Opioid Treatment Programs.

2024-02-01,"Dry January is over, but are 'sober drinks' a healthy way to keep it going? | CNN","Choosing a sober beverage over an alcoholic drink has its advantages, experts say.

CNN --

A year ago, Corrina Montejano decided to take part in Dry January and completely remove alcohol from her life for a month. She had attempted the challenge in the past but would typically throw in the towel after about a week.

But in 2023, Montejano became aware of the firm grasp alcohol had on her life.

Montejano, 30, a fitness coach and content creator living in San Francisco, says she was having two or three drinks a night when she decided to quit. Heavy drinking for a woman is defined as having eight or more alcoholic beverages per week, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For men, the threshold is 15 or more drinks per week.

""I was on the verge of being truly addicted to alcohol,"" she said. Dry January ""was the perfect eye-opener.""

Now sober, Montejano has adopted several tactics to keep herself on track: talking to a therapist, journaling and drinking nonalcoholic beverages like mocktails.

""The nonalcoholic spirits, wines and beers were probably the biggest factor in helping me maintain sobriety,"" she said.

Choosing a ""sober beverage"" over an alcoholic drink has its advantages, according to Ginger Hultin, a registered dietitian and nutritionist based in Seattle.

""The benefit is, it just doesn't have the alcohol,"" she said. ""So it doesn't have any of the intoxicating effects or depressant effects.""

Still, nonalcoholic drinks might not be right for everyone, and experts say there are several things to consider before diving into the world of sober beverages.

How nonalcoholic beverages differ

Several brands have recently entered the beverage market with alcohol alternatives such as craft mocktails, dealcoholized wines and nonalcoholic spirits and beers.

Hilary Sheinbaum, a trend journalist and author of ""The Dry Challenge: How to Lose the Booze for Dry January, Sober October, and Any Other Alcohol-Free Month,"" says there were very few nonalcoholic options available to her when she participated in her first Dry January in 2017.

""It wasn't readily available at the bar or even at my local grocery store,"" she said. ""There wasn't this conversation that there is now.""

In recent years, major alcohol companies including Heineken and Molson Coors have joined the sober trend with nonalcoholic options.

In the US, a beverage is labeled nonalcoholic if it contains between 0.0% and 0.5% alcohol by volume or ABV, according to regulations enforced by the US Department of the Treasury's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.

By comparison, a 12-ounce glass of beer contains about 5% alcohol, according to the CDC. Meanwhile, 1.5-ounces of 80-proof distilled spirits or liquor -- gin, rum, vodka or whiskey -- contains 40% alcohol.

Sober wines can also be labeled as nonalcoholic or alcohol-free, the Tax and Trade Bureau says. Many are often labeled as dealcoholized or alcohol-removed because of how they are made.

""They are first made as a wine, and then the alcohol is extracted from it,"" Sheinbaum said, adding that most ""alcohol-removed"" beverages are made with the same ingredients as their alcoholic counterparts and taste like them.

Craft mocktails contain zero alcohol and are made from ingredients such as carbonated water and fruit concentrate and are packaged to look and taste like alcoholic cocktails.

Regardless of the alcohol content on the label, Hultin says, all nonalcoholic beverages come with a nutrition label that should be read carefully before consumption.

""You get to see what's in there and what the ingredients are,"" she said. ""And then you can make more informed decisions.""

Sober drinks can limit health risks

Nonalcoholic beverages can help people limit alcohol consumption and its associated health risks, according to Dr. Lara Ray, a clinical psychologist who also runs the UCLA Addictions Lab, which studies the clinical neuroscience of drug and alcohol addiction.

""Someone might think, 'Oh, I'm just a regular drinker. I'm not a problem drinker,' but one may still be elevating their risk and the specific mechanism by which alcohol elevates cancer risk,"" she said.

In January 2023, the World Health Organization said in a statement that ""no level of alcohol consumption is safe"" because it increases a person's risk of several types of cancer, including bowel and breast cancer.

Alcohol ""causes cancer through biological mechanisms as the compound breaks down in the body, which means that any beverage containing alcohol, regardless of its price and quality, poses a risk of developing cancer,"" WHO said.

High blood pressure, heart disease, stroke and liver disease are also associated with excessive alcohol consumption, according to the CDC, as well as cognitive issues such as dementia and mental health problems like depression and anxiety.

Many mocktail products are designed to relieve anxiety and stress, Montejano says, with some brands offering ""calming relaxation spirits"" that help consumers unwind. Other products have ""energizing"" and ""euphoric"" effects, she says, ideal for a night out.

Some mocktails include immune-active botanical extracts such as echinacea and adaptogens, herbs and roots that may help the body manage stress.

Although these ingredients can offer some health benefits, the amount is probably not enough to make a positive impact on the body, says Dr. Dana Ellis Hunnes, senior clinical dietitian at UCLA Medical Center.

""That doesn't mean it's not healthy or anti-inflammatory, but you're always better off getting health or anti-inflammation from whole foods, not just isolated ingredients,"" she said.

When it comes to mocktail brands, Hunnes says, you want to look for ingredients that are real foods, such as turmeric or ginger.

Botanical extracts and adaptogens are typically not regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, she added, so you should speak with your doctor or pharmacist before consuming them.

""There are plants and plant extracts that can negatively or positively interact with medications,"" she said. ""It's important to inform your health care provider if you're taking supplements or foods with higher levels of plant extracts.""

Placebos aren't for everyone

Nonalcoholic beverages may not be the ""healthier"" option for people with alcohol use disorder, according to Ray, because they often look and taste the same as alcoholic drinks.

""The nonalcoholic beverages have a lot of the cues that are associated with real alcoholic beverages,"" she said. ""For some people, all of those cues together become really powerful, and they're like, 'I want the real thing.'""

Some beverages with as little as 0.5% ABV can still be harmful to people with cirrhosis of the liver, a condition in which the organ is scarred and permanently damaged, research shows.

Additionally, some mocktails sold at bars and restaurants can contain a lot of refined sugar because they're made with sodas and fruit juices, Hultin adds, which may not align with a specific person's health goals.

Replacing alcohol with a glass of water would be ideal, Ray says, but it's important for people to have options if they want to cut back on overall alcohol consumption.

""Some people say, 'I am more comfortable just sticking to one drink, and I don't feel like I need to pay for mocktails. I'm fine with the iced tea,'"" She said. ""Other people feel like, 'No, it really helps me to have what looks like a drink.'""

Staying sober successfully

Although removing alcohol can lead to a healthier lifestyle, Hultin says, it's important to understand that doing so can be incredibly difficult due to its addictive qualities and its involvement in daily life.

""Alcohol has been consumed in human cultures around the world since the dawn of time,"" she adds. ""We can't just negate that.""

In order to be successful, Ray says, everyone needs to evaluate their own goals before beginning a sober journey.

""Are you reaching those goals with nonalcoholic beverages?"" she said. ""What are the pluses and minuses for you?""

Montejano recommends starting off slowly, abstaining from alcohol for a short time before moving forward.

""I committed to 30 days last year,"" she said. ""I did work with a therapist who helped me build a roadmap on tackling my first Dry January, and that helped me stay sober for that month and then prolong it.""

Montejano says her health changed for the better, and she was able to build a fitness company online while getting certified to teach yoga.

""I focused so much on 'what am I doing to fill up my time' and learning and growing as a person, versus 'how am I going to get through this next week without drinking?'"" she said.

Getting past the daily cravings is the biggest challenge, she admits.

""If you just look at it as 'I've got to win that 30-minute-a-day fight,'"" she said. ""You've won, and you're in control.""

During this period, Montejano recommends going for a walk, listening to a podcast or calling a friend. Journaling about your journey can also be a useful tool.

Ultimately, going sober can have social ramifications, so it's important to surround yourself with people who can support you.

""It's a challenging time, removing alcohol, because you might lose out on friendships, and dynamics definitely change,"" Montejano said.

2024-02-01,This is the world's rarest passport | CNN,"St John's Co-Cathedral -- This Roman Catholic cathedral in Valletta was built by the Order between 1573 and 1578.

CNN --

The Sovereign Military Order of Malta - also known as the Knights of Malta - isn't just a religious Catholic order with nearly 1,000 years of history. Nor is it just a multi-million-dollar-budget humanitarian aid organization, with operations including refugee camps and disaster relief programs in some 120 countries around the world.

It's also a sovereign nation, with United Nations observer status and its own constitution, but, unusually, without any land. It issues car license plates - without having any roads to drive them on - and its own stamps, currency and passports.

The Knights originated as a chivalric order in Jerusalem around 1099 and were gifted the Maltese archipelago in 1530 by the King of Spain. Napoleon Bonaparte forced the Knights out of Malta in the French invasion of 1798, and these days the Order is headquartered in Rome. Daniel de Petri Testaferrata, the Malta-based President of the Order, tells CNN that only about 100 of the 13,500 knights, dames and chaplains now dispersed around the globe live in the Maltese archipelago.

The first passports were issued by the Order of Malta in the 1300s when its diplomats traveled to other states with documents attesting to their role as ambassadors. After World War II, the use of the diplomatic passport took on characteristics of passports used in other countries. Today, there are only around 500 of the diplomatic passports in circulation - making it the rarest passport in the world.

A very exclusive document

The Order's crimson passport (perhaps a nod to the blood of Christ) is reserved for members of the Sovereign Council and leaders of diplomatic missions and their families. It's adorned with gold lettering stating the organization's name in French, ""Ordre Souverain Militaire de Malte,"" and a crest.

""The Order grants passports to members of their government for the duration of their mandate,"" de Petri Testaferrata says. Grand Masters' passports are valid for the longest period as they're elected for 10 years, can serve two terms, and must retire by 85. Other passports are valid for four years and are only used for diplomatic missions. The passports have 44 pages watermarked with the Maltese cross without much other fanfare - no images or quotes.

Marianna Balfour, the Order's diplomatic public affairs and press officer, says that it can be funny to see the reaction of customs officers when they see the passport.

""They've likely never seen one before. Once when I arrived at the Bangkok airport, a crowd of operators at passport control wanted to see my rare passport and take a selfie with it,"" Balfour tells CNN.

According to De Petri Testaferrata, two-thirds of Schengen members recognize the diplomatic passport and the Order works closely with many countries with no formal diplomatic relations such as France, the United Kingdom and the United States.

""We provide rapid medical and humanitarian supplies to victims of conflict or natural disasters. We run hospitals, ambulance corps, medical centers, homes for the elderly and the disabled, soup kitchens and first aid posts,"" de Petri Testaferrata explains.

On the trail of Knights in Malta

While you're unlikely to run into any Knights on a visit to Malta, there are many places across the Maltese Islands to learn about the fight and fate of the storied Order.

One of the first things you'll notice as you arrive on the main island is the massive honey-hued Fort St. Angelo jutting out of the azure waters of the Grand Harbor. The imposing medieval bastion was once the Order's Headquarters and is the only remaining structure on the island that still partly belongs to the Knights.

De Petri Testaferrata tells CNN the chapel dedicated to St. Anne in the upper part of the Fort is still cared for by the Order. You can tour this part of the fort to see where the Grand Master de Valette prayed daily for deliverance from the Ottoman invaders during the Great Siege of 1565.

Inside the ancient bastion walls of Mdina, Malta's medieval capital and a UNESCO World Heritage site, you can learn more about the Order at ""The Knights of Malta"" 3D audiovisual show. It's located in the Casa Magazzini where the Knights once stored ammunition and tells the Knights' history in Malta, including when they were gifted the archipelago in 1530 by the King of Spain.

In the capital city of Valletta, you can continue your Knight trail at the National Library of Malta where the Pie Postulatio Voluntatis, the parchment Pope Paschal II used in 1113 to grant the Order sovereignty, is housed.

""The library's collection consists of original documents and manuscripts of the Order,"" Dane Munro, a tour guide and historian specializing in the history of the Order, says.

After the library, you can head across the street to the Grand Master's Palace which once hosted the Knights. The Throne Room was used by the Knights as the Hall of the Supreme Council and remains adorned with ancient frescoes depicting the Great Siege. Don't miss the portraits of Grand Masters in the Hall of Ambassadors.

Caravaggio's time as a Knight

Like all good chivalrous gentlemen, the Knights loved fine art, leading to a controversy. Renowned Italian painter Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio arrived in Malta in 1607 after killing a man in a duel and fleeing Rome. The Order made him a Knight and he became the court painter. Shortly after Caravaggio showcased he was more of a brawler than a gentleman and the Knights expelled him from the Order.

While visiting St John's Co-Cathedral, just a few blocks from the Grand Master's Palace, keep an eye out for ""The Beheading of St John"" which is Caravaggio's largest and only known signed work.

A few blocks away is the Casa Rocca Piccola of the de Piro family who were closely involved with the Order, according to Munro. You can take a tour of the grand home where Marquis Nicholas de Piro, the Chancellor of the Maltese Association of the Order, lives. His home is a time capsule of 16th-century Baroque elegance.

You can also stay in a palazzo that belonged to the Knights. Rosselli AX Privilege is a boutique hotel housed in the 17th-century home of Knight of Malta Don Pietro Rosselli and is centrally located in Valletta, making it the perfect home base as you tour around Malta to learn about the Knights.

If you get lucky and spot one of the few Knights on the archipelago, you might be able to identify them from their traditional robes, which are only worn during religious ceremonies. The black tunic with white cuffs features the eight-pointed Maltese cross. An additional decoration around the neck depicts the Knight's rank in the Order of Malta.","The Sovereign Military Order of Malta is also known as the Knights of Malta.

2024-02-01,Iowa superstar Caitlin Clark tallies 35 points to move up to second all-time on NCAA scoring leaderboard | CNN,"CNN --

College basketball superstar Caitlin Clark continues to make history with each passing game.

The reigning consensus National Player of the Year moved up to second place on the all-time NCAA Division I women's basketball scoring leaderboard on Wednesday night, as her Iowa Hawkeyes eased past the Northwestern Wildcats, 110-74.

Clark entered the game in fourth place on the scoring list, having passed WNBA legend Brittney Griner in January and sitting four points behind Missouri State's Jackie Stiles in third and 13 behind second-placed former Ohio State star Kelsey Mitchell, per ESPN.

In yet another dominant performance, Clark racked up 35 points to bring her career total to 3,424, only 103 short of the all-time record held by Kelsey Plum.

The Iowa native also became the Big Ten Conference's all-time leading scorer in the process.

""These coaches, they put me in positions to be successful, and you know, I've had a lot of really good teammates in my time here - and I can't do it without all of them,"" Clark said on-court after the game. ""I can't do it without Coach [Lisa] Bluder letting me have the keys to the offense.

""It's cool to be in the same vicinity as some of those names - a lot of people I grew up idolizing and looking up to - so definitely special for me.""

Clark also dished out 10 assists, giving her a 54th career double-double, and grabbed six rebounds, per the Hawkeyes. It was also her 50th career game with at least 30 points, the most in men's or women's college basketball over the last 25 seasons.

The 22-year-old is projected to be selected first overall by the Indiana Fever if she enters the 2024 WNBA draft, though she has the option to remain at the college level for an additional year due to the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on prior NCAA seasons.

Sophomore forward Hannah Stuelke added 17 points and nine rebounds for Iowa, while guard Kate Martin had 16. Melannie Daley led the way for Northwestern with 19 points off the bench.

The Hawkeyes took the lead just over three minutes into the game and did not relinquish their advantage from there.

""We came in here and got better. I love 28 assists on five turnovers, four people in double figures,"" said Iowa head Coach Lisa Bluder after the game. ""Caitlin becomes the all-time leading Big Ten scorer with this many games to go. I am always really proud of her.""

The Hawkeyes improve to 20-2 after Wednesday's road victory as they seek a second straight national championship appearance. Bluder's side will be looking to improve on last year's result, having fallen at the final hurdle against the LSU Tigers in 2023.","Caitlin Clark moves up to second place on all-time NCAA Division I women's basketball scoring list.

2024-02-01,Protesting farmers hurl eggs and clog streets with tractors as EU summit begins | CNN,"Protesters clash with police officers in Brussels on Thursday.

CNN --

Protesting farmers descended on the heart of the European Union on Thursday as leaders across the bloc held a crucial meeting at which they agreed new funding for Ukraine.

Demonstrators rolled into Brussels in their tractors in the early morning hours before gathering outside the European Parliament where the summit was being held, blaring horns, hurling eggs and sparking fires.

A handful of tractors had been parked near the EU Parliament all week before convoys from across the country converged on Thursday morning.

Some of the protesters set objects on fire in front of the parliament building, while others held signs with slogans including: ""No farmers, no food.""

Police said on Thursday that around 1,000 tractors were expected in the Belgian capital for the planned demonstration, warning about ""traffic problems"" in the area.

Although EU farming issues are not part of the summit's agenda, the demonstrators are aiming to put pressure on the bloc for their grievances to be heard.

Farmers have called for a loosening of the rules that govern the bloc's shared agricultural policy, saying they are not paid enough, are being choked by taxes and environmental restrictions and face unfair competition from abroad - including cheap agricultural imports from Ukraine.

The EU has waived quotas and duties on Ukrainian imports in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo called their concerns ""perfectly legitimate.""

""As you have seen, there is a major farmers protest in Brussels. We need to be able to discuss in the Council on this topic because the concerns that they have are perfectly legitimate.

""The climate transition is a key priority for our societies. We need to make sure that our farmers can be a partner in this,"" De Croo said on arrival at the summit.

Protests have also taken place over the past days in Italy, Spain, Romania, Poland, Germany, Portugal and the Netherlands.

In Greece, tractors are marching towards the second biggest city of Thessaloniki Thursday, hoping to block key routes inside the city.

In France, protesting farmers continue their roadblocks outside of Paris and near the cities of Lyon and Toulouse.

According to CNN affiliate BFMTV, 91 people were detained on Wednesday for obstructing traffic and causing damage near the Rungis market south of Paris, a key distribution food hub. According to the French government, more announcements are expected ""in the coming days.""

In an effort to address some of the farming industry's concerns, the European Commission proposed a ""temporary"" exemption for farmers to an EU rule that would oblige them to keep 4% of their arable land fallow or unproductive for biodiversity purposes.

It also proposed to ""renew the suspension of import duties and quotas on Ukrainian exports to the EU for another year, while reinforcing protection for sensitive EU agricultural products.""",Protesters descended on Brussels as leaders agreed new funding for Ukraine.

2024-02-01,Kamila Valieva's coach still has 'concerns' after four-year doping ban ruling | CNN,"Eteri Tutberidze (left) speaks with Kamila Valieva during the 2022 Winter Olympics.

CNN --

The coach of Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva has said that ""there are still many questions"" after the teenager was handed a four-year ban for an anti-doping violation.

In an Instagram post on Wednesday, Eteri Tutberidze said that, for two years, ""undeserved and endless hate and accusations"" have been thrown her way and that she too wanted to know ""what happened with Kamila and how this substance got into her body"" as all her ""athletes have been and remain clean.""

Tutberidze added: ""After two years, nothing has become clear, the origin of this drug has not been investigated, and there are still many questions. Only accusations from various sides continue to be directed towards us.""

Valieva tested positive for trimetazidine, a heart medication which can boost endurance, prior to the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.

The positive test only came to light after the then-15-year-old had guided the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) to gold in the figure skating team competition in Beijing, but this week's ban means that Valieva has been disqualified from the event.

That resulted in a change in the medal standings, with US awarded the gold medal, Japan the silver and the ROC relegated to bronze.

The doping case has placed increased scrutiny on Tutberidze, who is frequently referred to as the most powerful woman in figure skating. She is the driving force behind Russia's dominance in the sport, and her studio in Moscow attracts the best female figure skaters from across the country.

However, following the controversy at the Winter Olympics, many were left wondering how a 15-year-old was able to test positive for a banned substance.

Global Athlete, an athlete-led group working for change across the sporting world, called Valieva's positive drug test ""evidence of abuse of a minor"" and pointed to a ""power imbalance that sport leaders, administrators, and coaches have over athletes.""

However, Tutberidze has pledged her support to Valieva this week, saying, ""I have no questions for Kamila; she is a child, and from my side, I will continue to support her in every possible way.

""Not to offend all my previous athletes - Kamila is the most gifted athlete. She has faced a trial that is difficult to describe in words,"" the 49-year-old added.

Tutberidze also questioned if Valieva has been adequately represented during the hearing.

""Regarding the verdict, I have one main question - did anyone defend Kamila at the hearings? Because the verdict couldn't have been worse. Kamila's story is our pain,"" she said.

CNN's George Ramsay, Sandi Sidhu, Teele Rebane and Helen Regan contributed to reporting.","Eteri Tutberidze says ""there are still many questions"" after Kamila Valieva ban.

2024-02-01,Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake's 'Nipplegate' happened 20 years ago. People are still mad | CNN,"CNN --

Decades before football fans were discussing how much Taylor Swift is too much, there was another singing superstar some viewers saw more of than they wanted.

On February 1, 2004, the now-infamous ""Nipplegate"" incident occurred at the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show as Janet Jackson performed with Justin Timberlake, crescendoing to a costume malfunction/reveal that begot the aforementioned name.

Since then, Timberlake has bore the brunt of anger from many who blame him for not supporting Jackson in the aftermath, which included her reportedly being cut from the Grammys that year along with other professional opportunities.

Writer and culture critic Gerrick Kennedy understands the anger, but believes it's time to move on.

""I think the outrage towards Justin, at this point, not only is it unfair, but I actually believe that it continues to revictimize Janet,"" he told CNN. ""I think it really does this other piece that really bothers me the most, where it strips two adults from autonomy over a mistake.""

Here's a refresher as to what happened: The pair were performing Timberlake's hit ""Rock Your Body,"" and at the lyric ""Bet I'll have you naked by the end of this song,"" he was to rip Jackson's top to reveal a red bustier beneath.

Instead, the estimated 100 million+ viewers tuned in along with the Super Bowl attendees saw a flash of Jackson's bare breast with what appeared to be a nipple piercing. She quickly moved to cover herself, but the damage was already done.

The fallout was instant, and stunning.

Hundreds of thousands of complaints flooded into the Federal Communications Commission, CBS (which aired the Super Bowl) was fined and Jackson's career suffered.

The pair of pop stars were accused of staging the whole thing for publicity - something both Jackson and Timberlake have denied - and Jackson was initially mocked by everyone from comedians to some fans.

While both artists apologized for the incident, Timberlake was viewed as having abandoned Jackson after the mishap, after building his career largely by appropriating Black culture when it suited him with his R&B sound.

For years #JanetJacksonAppreciationDay trended every Super Bowl Sunday, driven by her supporters who were seeking ""Justice for Janet.""

When Timberlake was announced in 2017 as the halftime show headliner for Super Bowl LII, the move reignited calls for Timberlake to make it right.

Journalist Jason Lipshutz tweeted in 2017, ""Justin Timberlake officially doing Super Bowl halftime. Dream setlist - ""Lovestoned"" - 9-minute Janet Jackson apology - ""Gone"" (w/ *NSYNC)""

Now, two decades after it all happened, both Timberlake and Jackson still enjoy robust fan bases, yet Timberlake is still being held to account given that recent documentaries included reexaminations of his treatment in the early aughts of both Jackson as well as his ex-girlfriend, Britney Spears.

And as with every Super Bowl, the anniversary of ""Nipplegate"" has not been forgotten.

One person posted on X (formerly Twitter) Wednesday, ""20 years ago, justin timberlake exposed janet jackson's breast at the 2004 superbowl halftime show. jackson was punished by viacom by blacklisting her for nearly the rest of the decade while timberlake was left unpunished.""

For their part, both Spears and Jackson appear to be on good terms with Timberlake.

Despite her fans trolling his new song ""Selfish"" by returning Spears' 2011 song ""Selfish"" to the streaming charts, Spears recently posted her admiration of his tune on her verified Instagram account.

As for Jackson, in her 2022 Lifetime documentary, the ""If"" singer said she tried to advise Timberlake after the controversy.

""We talked once, and he said, 'I don't know if I should come out and make a statement,'"" she said. ""I said, 'Listen, I don't want any drama for you. They're aiming all of this at me.' So I just said if I were you, I wouldn't say anything.""

The incident ""was blown way out of proportion,"" she said.

""Of course, it was an accident. That should not have happened, but everyone is looking for someone to blame, and that's got to stop,"" Jackson said in the doc. ""Justin and I are very good friends, and we will always be very good friends. We spoke just a few days ago, and he and I have moved on, and it's time for everyone else to do the same.""

Hasan Ay, who is a superfan of Jackson's, agrees with her.

""It's not healthy to keep that much hate for so long,"" said Ay who last year appeared on an episode of ""The Janet Jackson Podcast."" ""Justin was in his early 20s when it happened, what he did was stupid but we've all been there. His was just in public. She's moved (on) and so should we.""

Kennedy said he believes the continued animosity is in part some people ""trying to overcompensate for the fact that many of us decided to treat [Jackson] differently after that moment.""

""I think that so much of our revisionist history is us making ourselves feel better about how we were then,"" he said. ""We do it with R. Kelly, we did it with Britney Spears, obviously we're doing it with Janet Jackson.""

""I think so much of what people are doing is they're trying to make themselves feel better for their jokes, for their shame, for clowning Janet,"" Kennedy added. ""All those things that people did culturally for a very long time.""

2024-02-01,Biden battles Trump for union workers as he heads to Michigan for UAW meeting | CNN Politics,"President Joe Biden speaks to United Auto Workers members at the UAW's Community Action Program legislative conference in Washington, DC, on January 24.

Washington CNN --

President Joe Biden on Thursday is looking to capitalize on last week's high-profile endorsement from the United Auto Workers, heading to Michigan to meet with members of the union as he battles Donald Trump for their votes.

Biden narrowly won Michigan in 2020, and the state - along with other union-heavy Midwestern states - is expected to be critical for his reelection bid. Trump, his likely 2024 opponent, is also trying to court union voters and met with Teamsters union leaders and workers in Washington on Wednesday as he tries to make inroads with what Democrats view as a vital voting bloc. The Teamsters previously endorsed candidates other than Trump in 2016 and 2020.

Story highlights

Biden goes to Michigan to meet with UAW members a week after receiving the union's endorsement

Trump and Biden are battling for the votes of union members. While Biden has endorsements from the nation's largest unions, Trump has support among the rank and file.

Trump met with members of the Teamsters in Washington on Wednesday.

Biden has touted himself as the most pro-union president in history and last week's endorsement appeared to give him a boost. While in Michigan on Thursday, the president will be meeting with UAW members, a Biden campaign official told CNN. The event, at a union hall near Detroit, will feature an ""informal"" conversation with union members, according to the campaign.

Union leadership is firmly behind the president. In a fiery speech while delivering the group's endorsement, UAW President Shawn Fain said Biden was the clear choice in a matchup with Trump. Biden last year became the first sitting president to join an active picket line.

""Joe Biden bet on the American worker while Donald Trump blamed the American workers,"" Fain said. ""We need to know who's going to sit in the most powerful seat in the world and help us win as a united working class. So if our endorsement must be earned, Joe Biden has earned it.""

Biden said he ""kept my commitment to be the most pro-union president ever.""

""I'm proud you have my back. Let me just say I'm honored to have your back, and you have mine,"" the president said after receiving the UAW's endorsement last week.

The backing from union leadership may not convince all of the rank-and-file to vote for the president in November. Biden won the endorsement of the UAW in the 2020 campaign, even though many rank-and-file members supported Trump. Trump has made appealing to union voters a key part of his political strategy, in no small part by targeting disaffected voters in parts of the Midwest who believe the Democratic Party has left them behind.

Since the group publicly backed Biden, Trump has hit back, slamming Fain as a ""dope"" and vowing that he could revive the automobile industry in the United States.

The union vote is no longer reliably Democratic - and Trump's efforts to court the union vote seem to have been working, especially among non-college-educated union workers.

Still, the UAW's endorsement last week could be important for Biden's chances in the union-heavy state.

The president's visit to Michigan will also serve as a reminder of a growing political concern: erosion of support for the president among Arab-Americans. The Israel-Hamas war has led to thousands of civilian deaths and a widespread humanitarian crisis in Gaza, angering Arab-Americans and prompting many to call on Biden to support a ceasefire in Gaza.

Biden's likelihood to repeat his 2020 victory in Michigan has been thrown into doubt because of his continued support for Israel's campaign. Some Michigan lawmakers who backed Biden's 2020 bid have been less enthusiastic as he gears up for the 2024 race.

Biden's campaign has been struggling to find Arab American leaders who are even willing to meet with campaign officials. Multiple local leaders in Michigan declined invitations to meet with Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez, with Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud telling CNN that he declined the meeting because ""this is not a time for electoral politics"" and that a conversation about change would be ""with policymakers. Not campaign staff.""

Chavez Rodriguez attended two meetings with local Arab and Palestinian-American leaders Friday morning, as well as other meetings with Hispanic and Black local elected officials and leaders in the afternoon.

Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who has been an outspoken critic of Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war, met with Chavez Rodriguez in Michigan on Friday, two sources familiar with the meeting said.

Michigan is both home to one of the largest concentrations of Arab-Americans in the country and a critical electoral battleground. More than 310,000 people of Middle Eastern or North African descent live in Michigan, according to the 2020 census, the state ranking behind only California in the number of MENA residents.

Biden's struggles with key sections of his coalition due to his support for Israel have become obvious in recent weeks, as several of his public events have been interrupted by people calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, including Biden's remarks last week after receiving the UAW endorsement. The UAW has called for a ceasefire.

As of Wednesday afternoon, campaign officials said there were no plans for the president to meet separately with members of the Arab-American community while he was in the Detroit area. But it appeared possible that the president might speak with Arab and Muslim leaders in a low-key and private setting - when he attended the UAW conference in Washington last week, he spoke backstage with a group of pro-ceasefire advocates during a photo line.

While the campaign did not publicize exactly where in the Detroit area Biden would go, it also appeared certain that local pro-ceasefire protests would likely pop up. Disruptions at Biden events have become common as Israel has continued its attacks in Gaza - at a recent campaign rally in northern Virginia, Biden's speech was interrupted more than a dozen times.

The White House itself declined to provide information about the president's visit to Michigan, saying the trip was political in nature and therefore outside the purview of government officials.

""The president has had meetings with Muslim and Arab leaders. Obviously, we don't read out every meeting. White House officials here have been in regular contact with Muslim and Arab leaders, folks in those community,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said ahead of the president's trip.

""We get this is a very difficult time for people. We get that. We get that it's a very difficult time for folks,"" she said. ""And we always believe it's important, the President believes it's important for Americans to feel like their voices can be heard and to do that in a peaceful way.""","President Joe Biden will meet with members of the United Auto Workers in Michigan.

2024-02-01,A fake recording of a candidate saying he'd rigged the election went viral. Experts say it's only the beginning | CNN Politics,"Michal Šimečka, a progressive politician in Slovakia, was targeted by a deepfake before a parliamentary election last year that he and his party ended up losing.

CNN --

Days before a pivotal election in Slovakia to determine who would lead the country, a damning audio recording spread online in which one of the top candidates seemingly boasted about how he'd rigged the election.

And if that wasn't bad enough, his voice could be heard on another recording talking about raising the cost of beer.

The recordings immediately went viral on social media, and the candidate, who is pro-NATO and aligned with Western interests, was defeated in September by an opponent who supported closer ties to Moscow and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

While the number of votes swayed by the leaked audio remains uncertain, two things are now abundantly clear: The recordings were fake, created using artificial intelligence; and US officials see the episode in Europe as a frightening harbinger of the sort of interference the United States will likely experience during the 2024 presidential election.

""As a nation, we are woefully underprepared,"" said V.S. Subrahmanian, a Northwestern University professor who focuses on the intersection of AI and security.

Senior national security officials in the US have been gearing up for ""deepfakes"" to inject confusion among voters in a way not previously seen, a senior US official familiar with the issue told CNN. That preparation has involved contingency planning for a foreign government potentially using AI to interfere in the election.

State and federal authorities are also grappling with increased urgency to pass legislation and train election workers to respond to deepfakes, but limited resources within elections offices and inconsistent policies have led some experts to argue that the US is not equipped for the magnitude of the challenge, a CNN review found.

Already, the US has seen AI-generated disinformation in action.

In New Hampshire, a fake version of President Joe Biden's voice was featured in robocalls that sought to discourage Democrats from participating in the primary. AI images that falsely depicted former President Donald Trump sitting with teenage girls on Jeffrey Epstein's plane circulated on social media last month. A deepfake posted on Twitter last February portrayed a leading Democratic candidate for mayor of Chicago as indifferent toward police shootings.

Various forms of disinformation can shape public opinion, as evidenced by the widely held false belief that Trump won the 2020 election. But generative AI amplifies that threat by enabling anyone to cheaply create realistic-looking content that can rapidly spread online.

Political operatives and pranksters can pull off attacks just easily as Russia, China or other nation state actors. Researchers in Slovakia have speculated that the vote-rigging deepfake their country faced was the work of the Russian government.

""I can imagine scenarios where nation state adversaries record deepfake audios that are disseminated using both social media as well as messaging services to drum up support for candidates they like and spread malicious rumors about candidates they don't like,"" said Subrahmanian, the Northwestern professor.

The FBI or Department of Homeland Security can move more swiftly to speak out publicly against a threat if they know that a foreign actor is behind a deepfake, said a senior US official familiar with the issue. But if an American citizen could be behind a deepfake, US national security officials would be more reluctant to counter it publicly out of fear of giving the impression that they are influencing the election or restricting speech, the official said.

And once a deepfake appears on social media, it can be nearly impossible to stop its spread.

""The concern is that there's going to be a deepfake of a secretary of state who says something about the results, who says something about the polling, and you can't tell the difference,"" said the official, who was not authorized to speak to the press.

States try to prepare

Efforts to regulate deepfakes and guard against their effects vary greatly among US states.

Some states including California, Michigan, Minnesota, Texas and Washington have passed laws that regulate deepfakes in elections. Minnesota's law, for example, makes it a crime for someone to knowingly disseminate a deepfake intended to harm a candidate within 90 days of an election. Michigan's laws require campaigns to disclose AI-manipulated media, among other mandates. More than two dozen other states have such legislation pending, according to a review by Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group.

CNN asked election officials in all 50 states about efforts to counter deepfakes. Out of 33 that responded, most described existing programs in their states to respond to general misinformation or cyber threats. Less than half of those states, however, referenced specific trainings, policies or programs crafted to respond to election-related deepfakes.

""Yes, this is something that keeps us all up at night,"" said Alex Curtas, a spokesperson for New Mexico's secretary of state, when asked about the issue. Curtas said New Mexico has plans for tabletop-exercises with local officials that will include discussion of deepfakes, but he said the state is still looking for tools to share with the public to help determine whether content has been generated with artificial intelligence.

Jared DeMarinis, Maryland's administrator of elections, told CNN his state issued a rule that requires political ads that involve AI-generated content to include disclaimers, but he said he hopes the state legislature will pass a law that gives the state more authority on the issue.

""I don't believe you can completely outlaw the activity but there is a substantial governmental interest in making sure the electorate knows what they are seeing, because the old saying 'seeing is believing' is no longer the case,"" DeMarinis said.

Other states acknowledged limited efforts. ""The Idaho Secretary of State's Office has not taken any specific actions surrounding deepfakes,"" spokesperson Chelsea Carattini said in an email, though she added Idaho plans to launch a new website for voters to find reliable information.

Some efforts to combat disinformation have triggered more distrust. Last year, Washington's secretary of state's office signed a contract with a tech company to track election-related falsehoods on social media, which would include deepfakes, a spokesperson told CNN. But in November, the state's Republican Party submitted an ethics complaint related to that contract, alleging the secretary was using public funds to pay a company to ""surveil voters ... suppressing opposition views."" The state ethics board declined to move forward on the complaint, which elicited more protest from the party.

Multiple pieces of federal legislation on election-related deepfakes have been proposed. US law currently prohibits campaigns from ""fraudulently misrepresenting"" other candidates, but whether that includes deepfakes is an open question. The Federal Election Commission has been considering the idea but has not reached a decision on the matter.

Ilana Beller of Public Citizen, the consumer advocacy group, expressed cautious optimism over the rate that both red- and blue-leaning states have been proposing and passing legislation on deepfakes, but she said more must be done.

""We would like to see more from the federal government, from the FEC and from many states that haven't taken the step to regulate on this issue,"" Beller said.

Lessons from Chicago

Some US candidates have been forced to personally figure out how to respond to deepfakes.

Paul Vallas, for example, ran for mayor of Chicago as a moderate Democrat last year and was targeted by an audio clip posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, by a mysterious account called ""Chicago Lakefront News.""

""These days people will accuse a cop of being bad if they kill one person that was running away. Back in my day, cops would kill, say, 17 or 18 civilians in their career and nobody would bat an eye,"" said the voice in the post that sounded nearly identical to Vallas. ""We need to stop defunding the police and start refunding them.""

Vallas' campaign responded by issuing a statement that denounced the video as fake and deceptive. But by then, it had been viewed thousands of times before being deleted. While Vallas won the first round of voting, he ultimately lost the election in a runoff to a progressive candidate, Brandon Johnson.

Asked if he thinks the deepfake cost him the race, Vallas said, ""No, you know, I think it was a factor in a close election.""

""We'll never know who actually created the video, but clearly there was a campaign on multiple fronts to try to misrepresent my record and to try to characterize my candidacy as something that it was not,"" he added. ""There's some damage that's not repairable, so in a close race something like that can be a factor.""

A warning from Slovakia

Michal Šimečka, the leader of the Progressive Slovakia party, understands why some people could have been fooled by the deepfake that falsely purported to capture him discussing with a journalist a plan to manipulate votes at polling stations.

""It does sound like me,"" Šimečka told CNN, referring to the audio, which he said played into conspiracy theories that a segment of the population already believed.

The fake audio emerged on the barely regulated messaging app Telegram two days before Slovakia's parliamentary elections and quickly jumped to TikTok, YouTube and Facebook.

Šimečka said his team and others complained to social media platforms and law enforcement. Despite some platforms removing or slapping factcheck warnings on some posts containing the audio, it continued to spread.

Šimečka said there's no way to know whether the deepfake altered the outcome of the election, which his party lost to a more Russia-friendly party, but said, ""It probably had some effect.""

Daniel Milo, who until December ran a center within Slovakia's Ministry of Interior setup to counter disinformation, said the debacle showed the way in which some major social media platforms lack processes to effectively respond to deepfakes.

TikTok and YouTube outright deleted copies of the deepfake, he said, while Facebook deleted some, marked others as false but did not touch others. He estimates hundreds of thousands of people saw posts containing the audio.

He said social media platforms need to ""put measures in place"" to prevent attempts to meddle with an election.

A spokesperson for Meta, Facebook's parent company, said in a statement, ""Our independent fact-checking network reviews and rates misinformation -- including content that's AI-generated -- and we label it and down-rank it in feed so fewer people see it."" While the statement said content that violates company policies is removed, it did not address why some posts containing the Slovak deepfake were not marked as false.

While the original source of the vote-rigging deepfake has not been confirmed, Milo said that some of the earliest posts containing the audio came from pro-Russian politicians in Slovakia. He believes it's not a coincidence that Russia's government publicly pushed a similar conspiracy theory on the same day the deepfake emerged.

""In my professional capacity, I do believe that this deepfake was part of a wider influence campaign by Russia to interfere in the Slovak elections,"" Milo said.

Janis Sarts, director of the NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence, a NATO-accredited research organization based in Latvia, said in a statement that there's no known evidence showing the deepfake originated in Russia, though he also noted that just over an hour before the deepfake surfaced, Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) released a press statement accusing the US of trying to influence Slovakia's election in favor of Slovakia's progressive party. The Russian statement specifically named Šimečka.

""The claims made in the Russian Intelligence Service's statement and the content of the deepfake that went viral simultaneously correspond to each other. They both target Progressive Slovakia and promote the same false narrative,"" Sarts said. He added that one of the politicians in Slovakia who first posted the deepfake appeared on the news of a Russian channel within a day and made similar claims.

Russia's SVR did not respond to a request for comment.

Regardless of the source, Milo said the US and other nations with elections this year should get ready.

""My warning is brace yourself for upcoming barrage of deepfakes, of audio and video content that will be targeting presidential candidates that will try to polarize and disrupt the social cohesion in the US,"" Milo said.

It was a sentiment echoed by Šimečka.

""I think this might be the year when we see a deepfake boom in election campaigns all across the world,"" he said. ""It's effective. It's fairly easy to produce. There isn't regulation to combat it effectively.""","US officials gearing up for ""deepfakes"" to inject confusion among voters in a way not previously seen.

2024-02-01,"Exclusive: Embattled Georgia prosecutor will not recuse amid affair allegations in Trump election case, sources say | CNN Politics","Story highlights

Willis not planning to step down from Trump election interference case in Georgia

Feb. 2 deadline to respond to allegations of improper romantic relationship with prosecutor

Wade's contentious divorce dispute temporarily settled

CNN --

Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has no plans to step down from the Georgia election subversion case over allegations she's having an affair with her lead prosecutor, a decision driven in part over concern that her departure would effectively end the case against Donald Trump and his multiple defendants, sources familiar with the thinking inside the DA's office told CNN.

The sprawling racketeering case still has no trial date, and Willis and her team are keenly aware that the window to go to trial before the 2024 election is rapidly shrinking. Any change in the team handling the prosecution would likely delay the proceedings, and it's unclear if another prosecutor in Georgia would even be inclined to take up the case, given its political and legal challenges.

Willis has faced immense public scrutiny since allegations first surfaced that she has benefitted financially from a romantic relationship with lead prosecutor Nathan Wade. Despite calls by some legal experts to recuse herself from the case to protect its integrity, she is not expected to do so, the sources told CNN.

Instead, Willis is preparing to counter arguments from Trump and other co-defendants, not by necessarily disputing claims about the relationship but by arguing that defense attorneys seeking to remove her are wrong on the law, sources said.

Despite her relative public silence since the allegations surfaced, Willis has been personally involved in crafting her office's formal response, according to a source familiar with her role.

Crucial few weeks

Willis has until Friday to provide written responses to the allegations lodged by Mike Roman, a former Trump campaign operative from 2020 who is a co-defendant in the case, setting up a crucial few weeks.

Judge Scott McAfee has scheduled a February 15 hearing for both sides to present evidence related to the allegations. CNN previously reported that defense attorneys issued nearly a dozen subpoenas for potential witnesses to testify publicly in that hearing, including to Willis, Wade and others.

While some inside the DA's office believe the odds are low Willis will ultimately have to take the stand during the February 15 evidentiary hearing, sources acknowledge it is not out of the question.

Willis was also subpoenaed in Wade's contentious divorce dispute in neighboring Cobb County, but the judge has paused any decision on whether she will ultimately have to testify. Wade was scheduled to testify on Wednesday over allegations he hid income from his estranged wife but on Tuesday afternoon, the dispute was temporarily settled, much to the relief of some in the DA's office, a source told CNN.

Despite her intention to focus on the legal merits of the case, the allegations have provided cover for some political allies of Trump to resume attacking Willis and the case itself. Still, a source familiar with the thinking inside the DA's office told CNN they would be ""mystified"" if it succeeds in removing her.

Norm Eisen, who served as White House Ethics czar during the Obama administration and is a CNN legal analyst, has called for Wade -- but not Willis -- to voluntarily step aside from the case despite arguing that neither are disqualified under Georgia law.

""I think it is the wise thing to do, but it is not legally required for him to step aside,"" Eisen told reporters last month, referring to Wade. Eisen said the allegations do not concern him about Willis' ability to try the case.

Wade's immediate future remains unclear. Sources said there are no immediate plans for Wade to step down but if he did, Willis could replace him with another lead prosecutor or lean on her experienced staff without causing a delay in the proceedings.

Willis 'not been a good crisis communicator'

Credit card charges that surfaced in Wade's divorce case show he paid for two plane tickets for Willis to Miami and San Francisco, but beyond that, there has been no other evidence provided to suggest anything improper or illegal happened. Trump and two co-defendants allege the relationship and vacations they say were paid for by Wade amount to a disqualifying conflict of interest. Wade has earned more than $650,000 for his work on the case since 2021.

Former DeKalb County District Attorney Robert James told CNN he is a friend of Willis and that he is not convinced she broke any laws for allegedly having an improper relationship with her top deputy.

""I think a lot of what I've read is more of a distraction and not legally substantive,"" James told CNN in a sit-down interview.

""Having an alleged affair with a subordinate, I don't really know how that has anything to do with the case or the facts, or the evidence, or whether Donald J. Trump or any of these other individuals have done what's in the indictment,"" James said.

James did acknowledge that the political impact of the allegations could come into play during jury selection.

""These allegations of affairs can be distracting and can lead jurors to say, 'You know what, I don't like that prosecutor. I don't like that prosecutor's office. I don't like this case. Doesn't matter what the evidence says, I'm not going to convict,'"" James said. ""That's the real danger here.""

Georgia State University assistant law professor Anthony Michael Kreis told CNN he believes that Willis has ""not been a good crisis communicator,"" but for Kreis, another issue at hand is the political threats Willis faces from partisan politicians in the GOP-controlled state legislature.

Moves by Georgia Republicans

Last week, Georgia lawmakers voted to form a special committee to investigate Willis, the latest and potentially most significant in a series of moves by the Republican-held state legislature regarding the case, including a resolution by one lawmaker to have Willis impeached - a move not supported by Georgia's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp.

The committee will have subpoena power, giving it teeth, but it cannot disqualify Willis or bring an end to the case and can only write a report.

""A special committee in the Georgia legislature with subpoena power is an exceedingly rare thing. It's not something that we have in Georgia quite often,"" Kreis told CNN. ""It's certainly could be damaging, and I think if nothing else it will create a huge headache for the DA's office.""

Kreis told CNN while he does not believe any of the efforts in the Georgia legislature will derail the case in a significant way, he does believe they are ""politically symbolic,"" and worth watching.

""I think what we really have here at the worst-case scenario is an ethical problem. There will certainly be questions about whether this was the wisest use of public taxpayer money. That's a big political problem. It's an optics problem. It's a reelection problem. I think it's very unlikely that we'll see any criminal action come out of that,"" Kreis told CNN.

While Willis and select prosecutors on her team have been working on their written response to the allegations, others in the DA's office are working to address other outstanding motions to dismiss the case. If Willis ultimately survives the current push to disqualify her, the case would effectively be back on track, sources told CNN.

McAfee has signaled he wants to rule on the remaining motions by the end of February and if they are denied, the case would move into the trial preparation phase.

And if the federal election case overseen by Jack Smith is delayed by several months, the Fulton County DA's office would be willing to ask the judge to set a trial date that's earlier than their initial August request, the sources said.","Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has no plans to step down from the Trump election interference case.

2024-02-01,EU agrees a deal on €50bn funding for Ukraine | CNN,"Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky walks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to a joint press conference in Kyiv on Tuesday.

2024-02-01,China executes couple for murder of toddlers that shocked the nation | CNN,"Hong Kong CNN --

China has executed a couple for throwing two toddlers out of a high-rise apartment window, in a case that provoked nationwide outrage.

The man and his girlfriend were found guilty of killing the children from his first marriage by staging an accidental fall from a residential tower in the southwestern metropolis of Chongqing, so that they could start a new family.

The father, Zhang Bo, began an affair with Ye Chengchen and initially hid the fact that he was married with children, but Ye found out and Zhang divorced his wife, according to China's supreme court.

Ye saw Zhang's two children as an ""obstacle"" to them getting married and a ""burden on their future life together,"" the court heard. She repeatedly urged Zhang to kill the toddlers and threatened to break up with him if he didn't.

After conspiring with Ye, in November 2020, Zhang threw his two-year-old daughter and one-year-old son from his 15th floor apartment when they were playing next to the bedroom window, killing them both, according to the court.

Zhang and Ye were sentenced to death in December 2021.

The Supreme People's Court said the couple's crime ""seriously challenged the legal and moral bottom line,"" calling their criminal motive ""extremely despicable"" and means ""particularly cruel,"" state news agency Xinhua reported.

News of their execution drew hundreds of millions of views on Chinese social media site Weibo, where it became a top trending topic.

""They deserved the punishment,"" said a top comment with 27,000 likes.

""How very satisfying!"" said another with 31,000 likes.

A study published in 2020 shows 68% of Chinese citizens are in favor of death penalty.

But John Zhuang Liu, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong who authored the paper, told CNN Thursday that online views might not accurately reflect China's public opinion.

His study shows that Chinese people who express political views online tend to show greater support for the death penalty.

""We do not have a clear understanding of the general public's views on the death penalty in China, and we lack a rigorous data collection channel,"" he said.

The 2020 paper was based on the last available nationwide data collected in 2013.

""We don't know whether public views have shifted since then,"" he said.

China does not provide transparent information on the total number of executions, but the country is believed to be ""the world's top executioner"" with thousands of people executed and sentenced to death each year, according to human rights group Amnesty International.

Wednesday's execution also brought into focus the main method used in China to carry out the death penalty: lethal injection.

""It's basically euthanasia. They had it easy,"" said a comment on Weibo with 20,000 likes.

Some drew attention to the recent execution of Alabama inmate Kenneth Smith by nitrogen gas, a new method that experts have said could lead to excessive pain or even torture.

The execution was hailed by some Chinese social media users as a punishment that fits more serious crimes.

""Why do I think the 22-minute execution is very suitable for those who maliciously kill their wives, parents, children and the serial murderers?"" a top comment said.","China executes a couple for throwing two toddlers out of a high-rise apartment window.

2024-02-01,"Paper napkin 'contract' to seal Lionel Messi move to FC Barcelona heads to auction with a $380,000 starting bid | CNN","CNN --

The paper napkin containing the agreement which saw Lionel Messi join FC Barcelona will go to auction with a starting price of $380,000 (£300,000).

The napkin, which was signed to acquire the talents of then 13-year-old Messi in 2000, will be sold by auction house Bonhams in March.

The commitment to a contract was written in blue ballpoint pen by Carles Rexach, the then sporting director of Barça, on the 6.5 x 6.5 inch napkin.

""In Barcelona, on December 14, 2000, in the presence of Mssrs. Minguella and Horacio, Carles Rexach, technical secretary of FC Barcelona, hereby agrees under his responsibility and against some dissenting opinions to sign the player Lionel Messi, provided that we keep to the amounts agreed,"" Rexach wrote.

The napkin is also signed by Horacio Gaggioli, the Argentine agent who first brought Messi to the attention of Barcelona, and Josep Minguella, the transfer advisor to the club at the time.

Together with Rexach, Minguella helped organize Messi's initial audition with the Blaugrana in September 2000.

On December 14, Rexach, Minguella and Gaggioli met for lunch at the Pompeia tennis club to sign the napkin. Later that night, Joan Gaspart - Barcelona's president at the time - confirmed and sealed the agreement, changing the history of football to come.

After developing in the famed La Masia - Barça's academy - Messi would go onto become one of the greatest players in the history of the game, having made his debut for the senior team in 2004 aged 16, becoming the youngest player to represent the club in an official match at the time.

It was the beginning of a legendary career for Messi, during which time he made 778 appearances for Barcelona, going on to break the club's goalscoring record and win 35 trophies during his time at the Camp Nou - including 10 La Liga titles and four Champions Leagues.

""This is one of the most thrilling items I have ever handled,"" Ian Ehling, head of fine books and manuscripts at Bonhams New York, said in a statement.

""Yes, it's a paper napkin, but it's the famous napkin that was at the inception of Lionel Messi's career.

2024-02-01,Elon Musk says Tesla shareholders will vote 'immediately' on quitting Delaware for Texas | CNN Business,"CNN --

Stung by a Delaware court ruling earlier this week that struck down his record Tesla pay package, Elon Musk says he is seeking shareholder approval to incorporate the company in Texas.

Soon after Tuesday's ruling about his 2018 salary package -- worth about $51 billion at current stock prices -- Musk put up a poll on X asking if Tesla (TSLA) should move its registration from Delaware to Texas, where it is already headquartered.

Hours later, the Tesla CEO wrote that the ""public vote is unequivocally in favor of Texas."" The poll results showed Texas had won the backing of more than 87% of about 1.1 million votes.

Musk added he will now ""immediately"" seek shareholder approval to incorporate the electric carmaker in the southern state.

Delaware is famously one of the world's most welcoming places for companies of all kinds and sizes to incorporate for legal and tax purposes. Nearly 70% of Fortune 500 companies are incorporated there.

It is seen as a desirable place to seek approval for mergers and litigate disputes, and doesn't levy sales tax or tax on profits from intellectual property.

While Musk has not commented directly on the judgment on his pay package, he tweeted Tuesday: ""Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.""

""I recommend incorporating in Nevada or Texas if you prefer shareholders to decide matters,"" he said in another tweet.

Attorneys for the Tesla shareholders who brought the suit had argued that the package of stock options was excessive and that the company's directors were too close to Musk to protect their interests.

The 303 million split-adjusted stock options that Musk had received as part of the package are worth $51 billion today, when calculated using Tuesday's closing price, less the modest exercise price of $23.34 a share.

Delaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, who oversaw the bench trial that concluded in November 2022, ruled Tuesday that Musk and the Tesla board ""bore the burden of proving that the compensation plan was fair, and they failed to meet their burden.""","Elon Musk says he will ""immediately"" seek shareholder approval to incorporate Tesla in Texas.

2024-02-01,Why Yemen's Houthi rebels welcome conflict with the US | CNN,"Editor's Note: A version of this story appears in CNN's Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region's biggest stories. Sign up here.

CNN --

A giant poster featuring Yemeni rebel leader Abdel Malek al-Houthi was hung on the ancient Walls of Constantinople in Istanbul last week, just days after his organization was designated a terror group by the United States.

""We are all Yemenis,"" read the text in Turkish.

Once seen in the Middle East as a menacing Iranian proxy that wreaked havoc in the Arab world's poorest country by overthrowing the internationally recognized government and prompting a brutal Saudi-led military intervention, the Houthi group's fortunes have changed since Israel launched its devastating war on Gaza.

Israel's war came after Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an October 7 attack on the Jewish state, killing 1,200 people and kidnapping more than 250 others, according to Israeli authorities. The war in Gaza has so far killed almost 27,000 people in the enclave, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in the territory.

The Shiite-Muslim Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah, are now seen in parts of the largely-Sunni Muslim world and beyond as champions of the Palestinian cause, defending the people of Gaza against Israel and even taking on the Jewish state's superpower ally in the fight.

Since mid-November the rebels have been attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea and the Strait of Bab al-Mandab. The Red Sea is a vital waterway that connects to the Suez Canal, through which 10% to 15% of world trade passes. The group's activities have effectively closed the trade route to most container ships as vessels steer clear of the waterway amid the attacks.

US officials have told CNN they believe the Iranian leadership is nervous about some of the actions of its proxy groups in the Middle East as fears of a direct confrontation with the United States escalate. US intelligence suggests that Iran is concerned that Houthi attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea could upset the economic interests of both China and India, key allies of Tehran.

There were signs this week that Iran is trying to rein in its proxies as Kataib Hezbollah, a militia in Iraq, said it was suspending operations against US targets following a strike that killed three American military personnel in Jordan. But Iran appears to have less control over the Houthis, as the Yemeni rebel group continued to target ships.

On Tuesday night, a cruise missile launched by the Houthis into the Red Sea came within a mile of a US destroyer before it was shot down, the closest a Houthi attack has come to a US warship. The episode underscored the threat the rebels continue to pose to US naval assets and commercial shipping despite multiple US and British strikes on Houthi infrastructure inside Yemen. Early on Thursday, the US carried out its latest round of airstrikes in Yemen, against a Houthi drone ground control station in Yemen and 10 Houthi drones.

Projecting power

The attacks in the Red Sea, Houthis say, are intended to pressure Israel and its allies to stop the war in Gaza. The group has repeatedly said that its operations in the Red Sea will cease once Israel stops the war and lifts its siege on the territory.

But experts say that while the Palestinian cause has always been central to Houthi ideology, their actions in the Red Sea come with other benefits.

In its fight, the Houthi group has distracted from Yemen's humanitarian crisis, shored up domestic and international support, and made its name known among those who knew little to nothing about the movement, they say.

""Solidarity with Gaza is only one of the drivers behind Houthi strikes in the Red Sea,"" said Thomas Juneau, an assistant professor at the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Ottawa and former analyst with Canada's Department of National Defense.

While anti-Israel and anti-American positions are at the heart of the group's ideology, ""the Gaza war should be seen more as a pretext for the Houthis,"" Juneau said, as it ""allows them to mobilize strong pro-Palestinian feelings"" and ""project their power outside of the country.""

The Houthis, having taken control of most of northern Yemen - including the capital Sanaa - present themselves as the legitimate rulers of the country. The rebel group has framed its operations in the Red Sea as being conducted by the ""Yemeni Armed Forces"". That narrative has taken hold among those who oppose the Gaza war the world over. The internationally recognized government meanwhile sits some 230 miles away in the southern city of Aden and is seen as weak.

'A way out'

Their attacks have been condemned by the US, the European Union, NATO and 44 other allied countries, who in a joint statement called the Houthi-led seizure of one cargo ship on November 19 ""appalling."" A month later, the US formed a multinational coalition meant to safeguard commerce in the Red Sea. The US and United Kingdom have since been conducting airstrikes on the Houthis.

The Yemeni group has shown no signs of backing down, which experts say is helping them secure reputational victories abroad as well as outside their traditional support base at home.

""Locally, their popularity has increased in some areas,"" said Ahmed Nagi, a senior Yemen analyst at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, adding that resentment remains with what is perceived as the sidelining of Yemen's domestic issues. For some Yemenis, the Houthis' attacks have also rekindled memories of the group's own violence at home amid the near decade-long civil war, he said.

Yemen's civil war began in 2014, when Houthi forces stormed the capital Sanaa and toppled the internationally recognized, Saudi-backed government. The conflict spiraled into a wider war in 2015 when a Saudi-led coalition intervened in an attempt to expel the Houthis. That attempt failed, leaving the country in ruins. Iran increased its support for the Houthis during that war as its proxy conflict with Saudi Arabia escalated.

After nearly eight years of war, a ceasefire between the Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition was signed in April 2022. While it lapsed just six months later, warring parties have not returned to full-scale conflict and the pause in fighting has largely held.

Juneau said there is no military or political rival that can challenge the Houthis domestically, but their rule in Yemen has been repressive and economically inefficient.

""Mobilizing strong pro-Palestinian feelings is therefore a very useful tactic to distract form their own domestic challenges,"" he said.

Today, more than 24 million people in Yemen - over 80% of the population - are in need of humanitarian aid and protection, according to the UN. The conflict has also left the country's infrastructure in tatters, exacerbated economic collapse and led to widespread displacement.

Asked in an interview with BBC Arabic why the rebel group is reacting to a foreign conflict amid Yemen's own domestic troubles, a top Houthi official countered that Western countries are doing the same by supporting Israel.

""Is Biden a neighbor to Netanyahu? Do they live in one apartment? Does the French president also live on the same floor, with the British prime minister living in the same building?"" Mohamed Ali al-Houthi, member of the Supreme Political Council, told BBC Arabic last month, boasting about drawing the US into the conflict.

During Yemen's civil war, the Houthis would blame the country's problems on the conflict, Nagi said.

""The war has calmed down, so there (is) pressure on the Houthis to fulfil their promises,"" Nagi told CNN, adding that amid grassroots demands for change, the escalation in the Red Sea and the events in Gaza were ""to some degree, a way out.""

Mohammed Ali Al-Houthi has denied that his group is seeking popularity with the Red Sea strikes, telling BBC Arabic the campaign comes from ""a standpoint of (duty to) faith and Islam.""

Houthis want to send a message

Along with opposition to the US and Israel, the Palestinian cause has always been central to the group's ideology. When Houthis rose to power, their slogan was: ""God Is Great, Death to America, Death to Israel, Curse on the Jews, Victory to Islam.""

""Houthis wanted to send a message: We are the group that is most committed to Gaza, not just in words but in action,"" Nagi said.

Nadwa Al-Dawsari, a non-resident fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington, DC, said that it is possible that the rebels want to draw the US into a direct war.

""The Houthis are banking on US conflict aversion,"" she said, adding that after their eight-year war with the US-backed Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, they ""emerged more confident"" and ""forced the Saudis to come to them desperate for an exit.""

While a war with the US is unlikely to unite Yemenis behind the Houthis, as a conflict of that scale would be devastating to an already suffering population, ""sustained US airstrikes could provide the Houthis with a pretext to compel (more Yemeni) people to join or contribute to their self-proclaimed 'war effort',"" Dawsari said.

Despite the potential repercussions on Yemenis at home, the Houthis have welcomed conflict with the US and its allies.

""The US and the UK must understand that we are in a time of retaliation, and that our people do not know surrender,"" Mohamed Ali al-Houthi posted last week on X. ""If you carry weapons, then the Yemeni people carry weapons as well, and if you have strength, then we are stronger with God.""

The official also brushed off the risk of Israeli retaliation, saying the Jewish state has created a false image of being ""a monster with a big army.""

""The Houthis are feeling hubristic, having not only survived years of bombing by Saudi Arabia, but emerged much stronger,"" Juneau said. ""They therefore likely believe that they can also survive US strikes, and use them to benefit politically.""","a giant poster featuring Yemeni rebel leader Abdel Malek al-Houthi was hung on the Walls of Constantinople last week.

2024-02-01,Pakistan election candidate shot dead as violence escalates ahead of nationwide vote | CNN,"Islamabad, Pakistan CNN --

A Pakistan election candidate was shot dead while campaigning on Wednesday, as violence escalates a week before polls open.

Rehan Zeb Khan, an independent candidate affiliated with former Prime Minister Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, was shot in a ""targeted killing"" when gunmen opened fire on his car in a market in Bajaur, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, according to district police. Three other people were injured.

The Islamic State Khorasan, or ISIS-K, later claimed responsibility for the attack.

It's the second killing of a candidate in recent weeks after Malik Kaleem Ullah, an independent candidate for the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Assembly, was shot dead on January 10 while going door to door, according to Reuters.

Wednesday's shooting is the latest in a string of attacks across the South Asian nation targeted at political candidates and parties ahead of the general election on February 8.

Also on Wednesday, the residences and offices of several candidates from Pakistan's People's Party and the election office of the Pakistan Muslim League were attacked in Balochistan province, injuring at least 15 people, according to caretaker Minister for Home and Tribal Affairs Balochistan Zubair Jamali.

At least one of the attacks was claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army, a militant separatist group.

Just a day earlier, four people were killed and five injured in a blast during PTI campaign rally in the city of Sibi in Balochistan, according to the PTI. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack.

In response to the violence, Pakistan's Election Commission (ECP) summoned an emergency meeting of security officials on Thursday to discuss the ""deteriorating"" law and order situation in the two provinces, according to a statement from the commission.

On Wednesday, Pakistan's military also met for an annual conference where they discussed the possible deployment of the country's army to assist the election commission during the general election next week, according to a government statement.

""No one would be allowed to indulge in violence in the name of political activity and sabotage the quintessential democratic exercise of conduct of free and fair elections,"" the statement said.

The election commission has declared February 8, the day of the election, a public holiday for the country's 240 million people.

Thursday's killing follows a turbulent week in Pakistani politics in which former Prime Minister Khan was sentenced to 14 years in prison for corruption, his second conviction in as many days.

Khan and members of the PTI party have been subjected to a widespread crackdown following his ouster from office in a no-confidence vote in April 2022, with some saying they were intimidated into silence, and others arrested on various charges or banned from leaving the country.","Rehan Zeb Khan was shot dead while campaigning in a market in Bajaur, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

2024-02-01,Medicare drug price negotiations begin after Biden administration makes initial offers | CNN Politics,"Drugmakers are receiving initial price offers from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

CNN --

Let the negotiating begin!

The Biden administration is sending its initial offers to the drugmakers participating in the historic first round of Medicare drug price negotiations on Thursday.

The move kicks off six months of discussions between the manufacturers and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. It comes as President Joe Biden is seeking to tout his efforts to lower drug prices ahead of the November presidential election and as the pharmaceutical companies attempt to halt the negotiation process in court.

""For the first time in history, Medicare is making offers on the fair price for 10 of the most widely used and expensive drugs,"" Biden said in a statement. ""Medicare is no longer taking whatever prices for these drugs that the pharmaceutical companies demand.""

Negotiations will take place between now and August 1. The agreed-upon maximum fair prices will be made public by September 1 and take effect in 2026.

The first 10 drugs are Eliquis, Jardiance, Xarelto, Januvia, Farxiga, Entresto, Enbrel, Imbruvica and Stelara, as well as Fiasp and certain other insulins made by Novo Nordisk, including NovoLog. The medications, which treat heart disease, certain cancers, diabetes and autoimmune diseases, among other conditions, cost Medicare $46.5 billion and enrollees $3.4 billion in out-of-pocket costs in 2022.

The drugmakers - which include Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck, Johnson & Johnson's Janssen division, Novo Nordisk and AstraZeneca, among others - and industry groups have filed multiple lawsuits in federal courts across the US in hopes of stopping the effort. They each contend that the program is unconstitutional in various ways.

Several have said they were essentially forced to participate or otherwise face steep penalties or withdrawal from the Medicare and Medicaid markets.

A senior administration official declined to discuss the tone of the dealings with the manufacturers, but Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told reporters that the two parties will ""have a chance to go back and forth until we agree on new pricing.""

""These are good faith, upfront negotiations, not price setting, and it will take both sides to reach a fair price,"" he said.

CMS considered multiple factors when developing its initial offer, including the drugs' clinical benefits and the price of alternatives, among others. The agency also held listening sessions so patients and others could provide input on the selected drugs. The discounts will range from at least 25% to 60% off the nonfederal average manufacturer price, depending on when the drugs were approved.

The effort was authorized by the Inflation Reduction Act that Democrats pushed through Congress in 2022. After this initial round, the Health and Human Services secretary can negotiate another 15 drugs for 2027 and again for 2028. The number rises to 20 drugs a year for 2029 and beyond.

In the first two years of negotiations, CMS will select only Part D drugs that are purchased at pharmacies. It will add Part B drugs, which are administered by doctors, to the mix for 2028.

The program is expected to save Medicare nearly $100 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. It's unclear how much enrollees will save.",Biden administration sends initial offers to drugmakers participating in historic first round of Medicare drug price negotiations.

Story highlights

Oral arguments are next week in the blockbuster case that will determine whether Trump can run again for president

Trump's critics hang their argument on a caveat

An interpretation of Scalia has drawn fierce pushback from other conservatives

CNN --

Liberal groups hoping to keep former President Donald Trump off the ballot for his role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol are turning to a surprising source as they make their case to the Supreme Court: the late Justice Antonin Scalia and several of the court's current conservatives.

The forces opposing Trump are citing a 2014 concurring opinion from Scalia, a hero of the conservative legal movement who died in 2016, as evidence that the 14th Amendment's ""insurrectionist ban"" applies to former presidents - not just rank-and-file federal officials.

The blockbuster case will determine whether Trump can run for president again. Oral arguments are scheduled for next Thursday.

On a court where conservatives hold a 6-3 supermajority, including three Trump nominees, citing Scalia is no coincidence. The advocates are hoping to convince the justices that they can write off Trump's arguments in a way that still squares with conservative legal principles.

""Invoking Scalia is kind of an attempt to cite some moral authority for one of the court's great originalists,"" said Notre Dame Law School Professor Derek Muller, an expert on the case. ""They're not just citing anyone.""

Trump claims presidents are not ""officers"" of the United States - a term used in the post-Civil War 14th Amendment - and so the ban does not apply to him. Instead, he argues, the term ""officers"" is meant to capture officials who are appointed by the president, take an oath to uphold the Constitution and then engage in insurrection.

His opponents, including both liberal groups and a number of former Republican officials, balk at that reading in a series of ""friend of the court"" briefs filed Wednesday.

The ""plain text demands"" that the amendment applies to former presidents, the Constitutional Accountability Center, a progressive legal advocacy organization, told the justices in a brief that cited Scalia. Historically, the group wrote, ""officials in every branch of government referred to the president as an officer of the United States.""

Former conservative appellate judge J. Michael Luttig, who has become an outspoken Trump critic, also cited Scalia in a brief to the court this week.

The Scalia concurrence, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and two other conservatives, involved a dispute between the teamsters and a soda distributor. The late justice wrote that all ""officers"" of the United States must be appointed by the president ""except where"" the Constitution ""provides otherwise.""

It is on that caveat that Trump's critics hang their argument.

The interpretation of Scalia has drawn fierce pushback from other conservatives, notably Joshua Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law Houston, who hopes to take part in arguments next week - in part to explain his read on the Scalia opinion and a short letter the late justice wrote weeks later.

Blackman believes it would be a mistake to view Scalia's terse language in the concurrence and the letter as a definitive statement of what his position was.

""Part of the problem with this case is people are litigating this issue in blogs and law review articles that are unreviewed,"" Blackman said. ""Some of these arguments have substantial problems.""

The Scalia concurrence is one instance in which anti-Trump advocates are highlighting past statements from the court's conservatives to counter the former president's arguments.

Others have called attention to an opinion Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in 2012 when he was a judge on the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals. Gorsuch wrote states were permitted to exclude candidates from the ballot if they were constitutionally ineligible from serving in the office they sought.

Though not mentioned in recent briefs, a case last month indirectly hit on one of the more technical questions in the Colorado ballot dispute: Whether certain constitutional provisions can be enforced on their own (known as ""self-executing"") or whether they first require Congress to pass a law. The Colorado Republican Party argues the anti-insurrection clause in the Colorado case requires Congress to step in first.

During the January 16 arguments in a case dealing with whether states may be sued directly when the government takes private property, Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative, posed difficult questions to both sides but at one point appeared to question the notion of a constitutional right requiring a law from Congress.

""That sounds like a very weak right if ... it's subject to limitation in that way,"" Alito said.

Whether references to such past statements have an influence on the court is an open question.

""Many times, members of the court greatly respect each other but will disagree with what they've had to say,"" Muller said. ""But for public consumption, it certainly can be persuasive.""","The forces opposing Trump are citing a 2014 concurring opinion from Scalia.

2024-02-01,"With about 5,000 adverse events related to cosmetics reported to the FDA each year, the agency is updating its oversight | CNN","The implementation of a new law is changing FDA regulations around the safety of cosmetic products.

CNN --

The US Food and Drug Administration receives about 5,000 reports each year about health problems related to the use of cosmetic products, and under a new law, the agency has issued updated instructions for reporting these types of serious adverse events.

The FDA's authority to regulate cosmetics has expanded under the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act or MoCRA, which went into effect December 29. The agency now requires manufacturers and distributors to submit reports of serious adverse events related to cosmetic products directly to the FDA - and to do so within 15 business days.

Reports of these events, ""until MoCRA, were only voluntary. So even if a serious adverse event was found, it was submitted to the agency on a voluntary basis,"" Dr. Linda Katz, director of the FDA's Office of Cosmetics and Colors, said Tuesday.

""If you look at, in general, the amount of adverse events that we get for cosmetics, they range,"" she said. ""They're about a little over 5,000 total per year. Not all of those are serious. In fact, it used to be that, when we'd look at them, about 25% would meet a definition previously of 'serious.'""

Under the new act, such an event can be considered ""serious"" if it results in death, a life-threatening experience, hospitalization, a persistent disability, medical or surgical interventions, a birth defect, infection or significant disfigurement, including second- or third-degree burns or significant hair loss.

""The serious adverse event reporting is really a key provision because it allows us to just understand a lot more about what's out there and what people are experiencing,"" Dr. Namandjé Bumpus, the FDA's chief scientist and soon-to-be principal deputy commissioner, said Tuesday. ""So these data will be beneficial to us and really help us advance public health as far as our regulation of cosmetics.""

The updated instructions require a manufacturer, packer or distributor whose name appears on the label of the cosmetic product to report serious adverse events within 15 business days.

That report must include a copy of the label that was on or within the retail packaging, and any new information about the adverse event that emerges within a year of the initial report must also be submitted to the FDA within 15 business days.

""Over the course of the next several months, we will have an electronic way that industry can submit these reports to us directly rather than having to use the paper forms,"" Katz said. ""In addition, we expect that consumers will also be able to file online.""

Currently, the FDA has a website instructing consumers and health care professionals on how to report a cosmetic-related complaint via phone, online or in the mail.

FDA looks at 'forever chemicals' in cosmetics

With the implementation of MoCRA, the FDA is also assessing the use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, in cosmetic products and the potential risks from PFAS exposure. The act requires the FDA to publish a report summarizing its safety assessment on PFAS in cosmetics before December 29, 2025.

PFAS, commonly called ""forever chemicals,"" are a group of widely used and long-lasting synthetic chemicals that linger in the environment and the human body because they break down very slowly over time. In July, a study from the US Geological Survey found that nearly half of the tap water in the United States is contaminated with these chemicals.

PFAS exposure has been linked to health effects including an increased risk of some cancers, obesity, high cholesterol, decreased fertility and developmental effects in children.

""PFAS, when it's present in a cosmetic product, may appear in two ways. It may be intentionally added to go ahead and make a product appear glossier or shinier than it would be without it. That's one of its uses. But it may also be a byproduct of the manufacturing of the cosmetic,"" Katz said Tuesday.

Both Katz and Bumpus added that there is not much data or published research available on PFAS in cosmetics.

""We'll be looking at the sum of the data that are there in the literature, but one of the great things about FDA being a scientific agency is that we can actually, very strategically, try to fill certain scientific gaps through our own research,"" Bumpus said.

""As a scientific agency, we also can generate data as needed through doing our own experimentation and we have really exceptional scientists who can do that,"" she said. ""So that will be part of what we leverage as we are trying to understand the potential impacts or science of PFAS for this report.""","FDA's authority to regulate cosmetics has expanded under the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act.

2024-02-01,Biogen discontinues Alzheimer's medication Aduhelm | CNN,"Biogen said it will discontinue commercialization of its Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm.

CNN --

The Alzheimer's medication Aduhelm is being discontinued by drugmaker Biogen as it shifts resources to its other Alzheimer's medication, Leqembi, and developing other treatments, the company said in a statement Wednesday.

""As a pioneer in Alzheimer's disease, Biogen is reprioritizing resources to build a leading franchise to address the multiple pathologies of the disease and patient needs. We plan to further advance the launch of Leqembi, together with Eisai, and continue to bolster innovation with the development of the other assets in our pipeline,"" Biogen CEO and President Christopher Viehbacher said in a statement.

The company said it will end the study that would've been needed for full approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. The decision to end development of the drug, which received accelerated approval in 2021, was ""not related to any safety or efficacy concerns,"" it said.

The drug has had a complicated regulatory history. The company had almost abandoned its clinical trials in March 2019 after an independent committee found that the drug probably would not slow the cognitive and functional impairment -- the decline in memory, language and judgment -- that comes with Alzheimer's. Another trial showed some benefit.

But the FDA and Biogen started a ""working group"" in June that year to see whether the effort to get the drug to market could be saved. The FDA ultimately gave it a green light through the accelerated approval process, which allowed the agency to approve a drug on a single study and additional evidence when there is an unmet need.

For Aduhelm, FDA made the decision without going back to its advisory committee, and it approved the drug for all patients, even though the company's studies were only in those early in their disease.

In 2022, the US House Committee on Oversight and Reform and the Committee on Energy and Commerce investigation said in a highly critical report that the effort between Biogen and the FDA to get the high-priced drug approved was ""rife with irregularities"" and ""exceeded the norm in some respects.""

The report concluded that Biogen set an ""unjustifiably high price"" for the drug to ""make history"" for the company, which saw the drug as an ""unprecedented financial opportunity."" The company had priced the drug at $56,000 per year, even though its actual impact on the broad patient population was unknown.

Medicare went on to restrict coverage of Aduhelm to those enrolled in qualifying clinical trials, saying at the time that the ""significant of serious unknown factors could result in harm.""

In a statement Wednesday, the Alzheimer's Association recognized the impact Aduhelm had on the Alzheimer's landscape, saying its accelerated approval kicked off ""a new era"" of treatments for the disease and ""provided hope for the millions of people living with early Alzheimer's, and their families.""

Dr. Allan Levey, director of the Goizueta Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Emory University, said he didn't think the announcement would affect too many patients. Most doctors prescribe Leqembi, which is covered by Medicare, unlike Aduhelm, he said.

""People are getting that, and it works in a similar way, but unlike with Aduhelm, there has been far less controversy,"" Levey said.

Dr. Heather M. Snyder, the Alzheimer's Association vice president of medical and scientific relations, said some people have been taking Aduhelm, and some have been enrolled in trials.

""For anybody that is receiving this news today as participants in the trials, as well as individuals that are taking this medication or just finding out about this announcement today, the Alzheimer's Association recommends that those individuals reach out, whether it be to the clinical trial study contact or to their personal health care provider, to talk through how this announcement changes their treatment and their care plan going forward,"" Snyder said.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, which is a general term for the loss of memory and intellectual abilities. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 6 million people are living with the disease, and unless there is a significant medical breakthrough, that number is expected to grow to 13.8 million by 2060, according to the Alzheimer's Association. Alzheimer's disease is fatal, and there is no cure. It is a slow-moving disease that starts with memory loss and ends with severe brain damage.

CNN --

A viral post by Elmo from ""Sesame Street"" was a pleasant throwback this week to the once-common, feel-good stories about social media as a force for good bringing people together. The puppet posted on X, simply asking how everyone was doing.

Viewed by more than 180 million people, a massive collective therapy session ensued. It seemed cathartic for those who took part, but it was clear not everyone is doing OK.

Today's social media atmosphere is also not OK. The darker stories are taking over and the wrong people have a platform, as in the horrible news that a man posted video to YouTube of himself claiming to hold his father's dismembered head and promoting conspiracy theories that flourish online.

It took longer than you'd expect for YouTube to remove the video, which means thousands of people saw it.

Or there is the horrible story of South Carolina state house Rep. Brandon Guffey, whose son died by suicide after being targeted in a sextortion scheme on Instagram. Guffey was taunted by people demanding money to hide nude pictures of his son. He's suing Instagram's parent company, Meta, for wrongful death and other claims and has spearheaded a state law in South Carolina to make such sextortion - a growing nationwide problem, according to the FBI - an aggravated felony in South Carolina.

Through the lens of the evil extremes of social media, that Elmo post could also be viewed as a man pretending to be a puppet and disarming social media users so they provide personal information to the world.

Everyone but Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg seems to acknowledge that, yes, Americans' addiction to social media - an addiction turbocharged in children - is a problem.

Zuckerberg and other social media company CEOs withered under a bipartisan explosion of pent-up anger and accusations Wednesday on Capitol Hill.

""It appears that you're trying to be the premier sex trafficking site in this country,"" said Sen. Marsha Blackburn, the Tennessee Republican, to Zuckerberg, pointing to failures at Instagram to take down content related to sex trade. It was one of the few claims that seemed to fluster the Meta CEO. He called Blackburn's claim ""ridiculous,"" but he also admitted there are things that his content moderators miss in the millions upon millions of posts on Instagram.

Read full coverage of the hearing from CNN Business or check out the takeaways from CNN's Brian Fung and Clare Duffy.

""As a collective, your platforms really suck at policing themselves,"" said Sheldon Whitehouse, the Rhode Island Democrat, noting lawmakers get complaints about the trafficking of fentanyl, bullying, child pornography, sexploitation and blackmail.

Phones are ""portals to predators, to viscousness, to bullying, to self-harm,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican.

Sorry?

""Your product is killing people,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley, the Missouri Republican and master of outrage, booming down at Zuckerberg and demanding that the tech billionaire consider compensating audience members in the hearing room whose children had committed suicide or suffered, they say, as a result of their children taking part in social media.

Zuckerberg, unable to get many words in to interrupt Hawley's barrage, did take the unusual opportunity to stand up, turn around and apologize to people for harm they experienced. Later, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel apologized to families of people who died after buying drugs on Snapchat.

All of this bipartisan bluster generated plenty of engaging, made-for-TV moments - particularly since Zuckerberg can often appear to have the empathy of a cyborg when he refuses to agree with the premise that social media can be harmful to children or when he refuses to simply say that his business model includes getting more people, including children, to engage with social media.

Obviously, it does. And anyone who has seen a teenager and parent both hunched over their phones can tell you the model works.

""Children are not your priority. Children are your product,"" Blackburn said.

The bipartisan bluster also only goes so far

If this is all feeling a bit familiar - the frustration of lawmakers and the dissembling of tech CEOs - that's because it's happened before.

Remember the Facebook whistleblower? Frances Haugen told lawmakers back in 2021 that Facebook was hiding internal research about the toxic effect of its apps on girls. Last May, the US surgeon general issued an advisory warning about the effects of social media on mental health, particularly children and adolescents.

While lawmakers promised Wednesday that they are working hard on new legislation to police social media, they've been saying that for years as the evidence of the harm on young people has only grown. It's a shortcoming they acknowledged. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, became visibly frustrated at the lack of congressional action over decades as the social media environment has evolved.

What might lawmakers actually do now?

There are any number of bills. Hawley has a proposal to ban social media accounts for users under the age of 16, something that seems unlikely to pass.

More lawmakers are behind the Protecting Kids on Social Media Act, which could set a national minimum age of 13 for social media accounts. Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat already ask users to verify they are over 13 for new accounts. On Instagram, accounts for older teens are initially set to private - but it is no problem for teens to find ways around age restrictions. TikTok asks parents to restrict their children from downloading the app.

Another proposal, the Kids Online Safety Act, sponsored by Blackburn and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat, has multiple sponsors and would require social media companies to do more to take ""reasonable measures"" to prevent harm.

There is also growing bipartisan agreement that the portion of US law known as Section 230, by which social media companies are immune from federal liability for content hosted on their sites, needs to be revisited. But lawmakers have also been talking about that step for years.

Zuckerberg did tell Sen. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican, that Guffey should be able to sue Meta.

There is no current path forward for any specific bill, even though the rhetoric on social media approaches apocalyptic.

""Your platform has become a killing field for the truth, hasn't it?"" Sen. John Kennedy, the Louisiana Republican, said to Zuckerberg, adding the platforms are ""cesspools of snark, where nobody learns anything.""

""I wonder if our technology is greater than our humanity,"" Kennedy later mused.

Sen. Laphonza Butler, the California Democrat, pointed to filters on social media platforms that allow users to envision their faces after plastic surgery and wondered how anyone could believe tech companies are going to do more to protect young women from harmful content when ""you give them the tools to affirm the self-hate that is spewed across your platforms.""

A focus on China

Sen. Tom Cotton, the Arkansas Republican, condensed the many concerns of Republican lawmakers about TikTok. Lawmakers do not believe the platform has done enough to shield Americans' data from the Chinese government, or as Cotton consistently calls it, ""the Chinese Communist Party.""

Cotton also asked TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, who is from Singapore and is married to an American, about his passport and his nationality. Over in the House, Republicans have empaneled a special committee to specifically concentrate on China. The witness at that committee's Wednesday hearing, while not focused on social media, was FBI Director Christopher Wray, who said Chinese hackers are preparing to ""wreak havoc"" on critical US infrastructure.

Wray's testimony came the day after CNN reported that the Chinese leader Xi Jinping promised President Joe Biden at their meeting outside San Francisco last November that China would not attempt to interfere in the coming US election.

Foreign election interference, by the way, as every American should know by now, is commonly attempted on social media with the spread of misinformation.","Social media is a force for good bringing people together.

2024-02-01,Nevada's dueling GOP primary contests create confusion despite Trump's assured delegate victory | CNN Politics,"CNN --

Donald Trump is certain to win Nevada's Republican presidential delegates -- but some voters who want to back the former president are confused about why they can't find him on their ballots.

It's the result of a dueling 2024 system in which the Silver State will hold two GOP contests within three days: the state government-run primary on February 6, where Trump isn't on the ballot and no delegates are at stake, and the Nevada Republican Party-run caucuses on February 8, where the former president faces no serious opposition to win the state's 26 delegates.

What's confounding some voters who are casting early primary ballots is that the choices in the two elections are entirely different.

Trump is only participating in the caucuses and thus isn't on primary ballots. Meanwhile, his lone remaining major 2024 GOP rival, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, is on the primary ballot and isn't participating in the caucuses.

""In your state, you have both a primary and you have a caucus. Don't worry about the primary, just do the caucus thing,"" Trump told attendees at a Las Vegas rally last weekend.

However, some Trump supporters who weren't aware of the distinction said they were baffled.

""I was like, why is the guy that I want to vote for not on this thing?"" said Leslie Miller, one of many waiting in line for his recent rally there.

""It's gonna be very confusing for people. It was for me,"" said Angela Barsekian, a grandmother of two who said she backed Trump in the previous two presidential elections.

Outside an early voting location in Henderson, Joseph Martin complained that he hadn't been able to find Trump on the ballot -- so he voted ""none of the above"" and plans to go to the caucus, too.

""The person I wanted to vote for wasn't on this ballot. I didn't know he wasn't going to be on this thing here,"" he said.

""I don't understand why we're doing it that way,"" said Bill Laine, another registered Republican who voted in the primary. Laine said he voted for Trump in 2020 but now supports Haley in the Nevada primary.

The parallel contests are the result of a 2021 Nevada state law that requires a primary -- a shift from the state's previous use of a presidential caucus system. Democrats in the state adopted the primary system -- President Joe Biden and author Marianne Williamson will both be on the February 6 Democratic primary ballot -- but Republicans rejected it, with the state GOP, led by Trump loyalists, opting instead to hold its own caucuses.

The Nevada GOP warned presidential candidates last year that they would not receive any delegates if they filed to run in the state's primary. But some, including Haley, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and former Vice President Mike Pence chose to do so anyway. All but Haley have dropped out of the race.

Meanwhile, Trump, as well as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and Texas pastor Ryan Binkley filed to run in the caucuses.

The departure of those candidates (aside from the little-known Binkley, who is still in the race) effectively cemented Trump's victory in the caucuses before either of the dueling contests were held.

""We will deliver you 100% of delegates of the state of Nevada to Donald J. Trump,"" Nevada Republican Party Chairman Michael McDonald said at Trump's Las Vegas rally.

The state GOP's decision has faced critics who say it was an effort to help Trump fend off a competitive race.

""I believe that they set up the caucus because they wanted to assure that Donald Trump was not embarrassed in Nevada and secured Nevada's vote,"" said former Clark County Republican Party Chairman Chuck Muth.

He added: ""This definitely smells of rigging the caucus on behalf of Donald Trump.""

Adding to the criticism of Nevada's parallel contests is the indictments of state Republican Party leaders, including McDonald and Clark County chairman Jesse Law, for attempting to falsely certify that Trump won Nevada in 2020 -- when he lost the state to Biden. McDonald and Law are among the six so-called ""fake electors,"" who have pleaded not guilty to felony charges brought against them by Nevada's attorney general in December.

""How do you trust it? To me, it comes across as complete pro Trump scam. That's it plain and simple,"" said Amy Tarkanian, a former state GOP chairwoman.

Tarkanian, who broke from the Trump wing of the GOP, called the caucuses another sign of Trump's hold of the party.

""It's sad and it's disappointing. I think really they've disenfranchised the Republican voter,"" she said.","Trump isn't on the ballot in Nevada's 2024 primary, so he's not participating in the caucuses.

2024-02-01,Democrats lean in on border security as Republicans scuttle deal | CNN Politics,"President Joe Biden speaks at South Carolina's First in the Nation dinner at the South Carolina State Fairgrounds in Columbia, South Carolina, on Saturday.

Story highlights

President Joe Biden has vowed to shut down the border if given the authority by Congress

One Democratic strategist said, ""Democrats have an opportunity to go on the offensive here.""

Republicans argue that Democrats don't have credibility on the issue with the electorate

Biden's remarks from over the weekend didn't sit well with everyone in his own party.

Democrats are doing what three months ago might have seemed unthinkable for the party in an election year: preparing to go on offense on border security.

After months of migrant surges at the US southern border and a barrage of GOP attacks against the president and his administration for the handling of the crisis, Democrats see a window of opportunity to seize on House Republicans' threats to tank a border compromise at the behest of former President Donald Trump who wants to campaign on the issue.

And they say they aren't going to waste it.

""It's the closest we've come in decades and they're rejecting it so they can't blame us,"" Rep. Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat said.

President Joe Biden on Tuesday also lay the blame squarely on Republicans, after embracing a tougher posture on border security over the weekend: ""Give me the power, I asked them the very day I got into office. Give me the Border Patrol, give me the people, give me the judges, give me the people who can stop this and make it work.""

The strategy is already playing out on the campaign trail.

Last week, Democratic candidate Tom Suozzi, who is running in a special election to replace former Rep. George Santos of New York, essentially crashed a news conference his opponent held on immigration. When they were done, Suozzi held his own gaggle with reporters and offered a rebuttal and an outline of bipartisan solutions to fix the border, something he was heavily involved in when he served in Congress back in 2019.

""It is a better issue to run on now than it was 10 days ago because of the fact that the deal is so close,"" Suozzi told CNN in an interview Tuesday.

The emerging border deal that's been the subject of weekslong talks among Senate negotiators would overhaul asylum and give the president new emergency authority to shut down the border, marking a departure from decadeslong protocol.

And Democrats are largely embracing the opportunity to talk about it, even as some argue it could hurt the party with their base and includes provisions that are far more conservative than what they would have embraced even a year ago. There is also the not so small issue of the fact that the text of the bill hasn't been released yet.

Still, Speaker Mike Johnson has signaled publicly and privately the bill isn't going anywhere in the House. House Republicans, meanwhile, are pressing forward with the impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas who played a role in the border negotiations.

That confluence of factors, Democratic lawmakers and strategists say, is giving Democrats an opportunity.

""It's clear that when it comes to border security, Democrats are for the fix, and Republicans are for the fiction,"" Rep. Eric Swalwell, a Democrat from California, told CNN.

It's that simple, boiled down messaging, one Democratic strategist explained, that is finally giving Democrats a bit of an upper hand.

""Democrats have an opportunity to go on the offensive here. To clearly point out how unserious Republicans are on border security."" the Democratic strategist said.

""We had a tough deal. And they chickened out,"" they added, referring to Republicans.

Biden leans in on border security

In a fiery speech to South Carolina Democrats on Saturday, Biden touted the emerging border deal and vowed to shut down the border if given the authority by Congress.

""It would also give me as president the emergency authority to shut down the border until it could get back under control. If that bill were the law today, I'd shut down the border right now and fix it quickly,"" he said, calling on Congress to ""get it done"" amid deep division on the issue.

It was first time in a campaign setting in this cycle that Biden has actively taken that stance on the border, though his campaign has been drawing sharp contrasts between his immigration policies and those of Trump.

""We are going to keep focusing on the offense on Trump and his failure and his extreme rhetoric on immigration,"" a campaign official told CNN, citing public polling showing that the majority of voters want to see a border solution, like an increase in border agents, that Biden has proposed.

The Biden campaign has slammed Trump for his record on immigration, his anti-immigrant rhetoric and what he's pledged to do if he wins a second term.

But Biden's willingness to publicly back a deal that would clamp down on border crossings didn't go unnoticed by Democratic strategists and allies.

""The toughness of it is what's different. But the overwhelming messaging and frame isn't different from before: We've tried to make progress on this issue and Republicans every step of the way have tried to stop it,"" another Democratic strategist said.

""The difference this time around is the administration is willing to go an extra step in terms of enforcement in a way that advocates, and the left, aren't happy about and still Republicans refused to make that happen,"" they added.

But Republicans argue that Democrats don't have credibility on the issue with the electorate.

""Let's have this battle right now. We know what the border was previous to this administration,"" said Rep. John Duarte, a Republican from California. ""We know very, very clearly what Joe Biden's failures and the Democrats' failures at the border have been.""

""If that is what they want to talk about, that's great because it's what we want to talk about,"" he added.

Progressives express concern over Biden's border sentiment

Biden's remarks from over the weekend, an extension of a statement released by the White House a day prior, didn't sit well with everyone in his own party.

Democratic Rep. Nanette Barragán of California told CNN she was disappointed with the president's statement.

""I disagree with the president's statement that the policies that are proposed in the Senate deal are fair. And that they've negotiated what I think would setback real comprehensive immigration reform, you know, 10 to 15 years,"" Barragán, said, cautioning that she hasn't seen the text of the border compromise.

Rep. Delia Ramirez, a Democrat from Illinois, called the president's willingness to give so much on the border issue ""dangerous.""

""I think it's dangerous for our president to be campaigning on this, and it also creates dangerous precedent. And think about that, if we're willing to put this kind of policy, this draconian policy into supplemental piece of legislation, what's next? Healthcare? Affirmative action? The list goes on,"" Ramirez said.

Notably, the deal isn't expected to include a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who arrived to the United States as children -- a population that's typically garnered bipartisan support and been included in previous reform packages.

The deal also does nothing to deal with millions more who are living in the US illegally and had been granted a path to citizenship in the 2013 immigration package.

The exclusion of the groups underscores a shift in the Democratic Party bruised by years of migrant surges at the US-Mexico border.

But Beatriz Lopez, deputy director of Immigration Hub, told CNN Americans support a balanced approach on immigration.

""Moving forward, it's important that he strike that balance,"" Lopez said, referring to Biden. ""It is about rebuilding his coalition, which includes moderates, but it also includes the base.""

Barragan echoed that approach, saying that Latino voters want to see border security and a path forward for immigrant communities.

""They want to hear that Democrats are fighting for them and we're fighting to make sure that we address the southern border, but also finding pathways to lift up our immigrant communities and acknowledging the economic contributions of immigrants,"" Barragán told CNN.

On Tuesday, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which Barragán chairs, released a set of principles to guide immigration reform. Top of the list was protecting Dreamers.

Despite pushback from progressives over the border compromise, Lopez said it's too early to know whether the messaging will divide the coalition heading into November.

""We're stuck in this moment right now in these negotiations, but looking forward, as we get closer to November, they have to appeal to not just swing voters, they have to be able to appeal to their base,"" Lopez said.

""Here's the bottom line: You can't out Trump,"" Lopez added. ""You have to be the contrast in order to win.""

Sen. Dick Durbin, the Democratic whip and a longtime advocate for comprehensive immigration reform, disagreed that Democrats would suppress the vote with the border compromise.

""No, I'm not worried about it,"" Durbin said. ""Because the people I represent understand that what's going on now in unacceptable and has to change.""","Democratic strategist: ""Democracy has an opportunity to go on the offensive here"" Republicans argue that Democrats don't have credibility on the issue with the electorate.

2024-02-01,Haley shows off foreign policy chops - and her contrast with Trump - as she details how she would respond to drone attack | CNN Politics,"Nikki Haley speaks at a rally on January 28, in Conway, South Carolina.

CNN --

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley has gone on a media blitz in recent days, detailing how she would respond to the deadly weekend drone attack in Jordan if she were commander-in-chief - an approach that holds up her foreign policy experience in stark contrast to former President Donald Trump.

In the wake of the attack that killed three American troops, the former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador has, over the course of six media interviews, called for going after Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps leadership, targeting the resources of Iran-backed militias throughout the region, and cutting off financial support to Iran with new sanctions.

Showcasing her foreign policy fluency, Haley has said that she would advocate for ""smartly hitting"" Iran to prevent the death of American soldiers - instead of ""randomly hitting"" Iran, which could lead to dramatic escalation.

""Find one or two of them that are making the decisions. It will chill all of them when you do that,"" Haley said on Fox News Monday, arguing such strikes would make Iran ""flat-footed.""

She then bolstered her threats on Tuesday, saying she would target IRGC leadership inside or outside Iran, a move that many fear would draw the US into the Middle East conflict even more directly.

""If they are in their country, or you do like Soleimani when they left the country,"" Haley said in another Fox interview, when asked if she would target IRGC leadership inside Iran. Haley was referencing the US drone strike that killed Qasem Soleimani, an Iranian commander, in Baghdad in 2020.

Unlike Haley, Trump has offered no specifics as to how he would respond to the drone strike, which also left at least at least 30 US service members injured.

In a Sunday night statement, Trump said the attack would never have happened if he were in office. Trump cited his administration's maximum pressure campaign on Iran. The former president then put out a statement Tuesday night blaming Biden for the death of the three service members.

""Three brave American Army Reservists are gone today -- leaving behind their grieving families -- because Crooked Joe enriched, emboldened, and empowered America's enemies to unleash chaos and terror onto the base in Jordan where these Patriots were so savagely murdered,"" Trump wrote, claiming that Biden's leadership is bringing the country ""straight into World War 3.""

Trump has not delved into how he would handle the escalating conflicts in the Middle East.

The differing approaches come after less than 15% of voters in the GOP primary in Iowa and New Hampshire listed foreign policy as the most important issue to them, according to CNN entrance and exit polls. Foreign policy fell behind the top two issues: the economy and immigration.

Haley has sought to showcase her foeign policy expertise throughout her campaign. And she is now seizing a moment to detail the plan of action that she would pursue, which she is also using to draw a contrast with President Joe Biden as well.

""My husband's serving overseas. Military families want to know their loved ones are protected. Biden didn't protect them, and there have been 160 strikes. There shouldn't have been one,"" Haley said on Monday. ""We lost three heroes because Biden was scared of his own shadow. That's the truth.""

Biden said on Tuesday that he has decided how the US would respond to the drone attack, but so far, he has not revealed what actions will be taken.

Whether or not Haley's response would be drastically different from Biden's remains to be seen. Biden and his team believe the military action must be forceful beyond what the US has done after previous, non-fatal attacks.

Haley - viewed as a more typical GOP hawk even as the party undergoes a foreign policy identity crisis - has claimed that her response to the deadly drone attack would prevent wars.

""The goal is always to prevent war,"" she has repeatedly said in recent days.

When challenged on the concept of hitting IRGC leadership while simultaneously seeking to prevent further war, Haley made the case that both were possible.

""You're going after their capabilities to hurt you further. Iran knows that they can't defeat America. They know that they don't want to take that on. The problem is they smell blood in the water. They smelled weakness from Biden since Afghanistan to Ukraine and everything in between,"" Haley said. ""So they are doing what they can because they can.""

Haley also explained that she believes that Americans don't have an appetite for broader conflict because no one has clearly articulated where and why American action overseas is needed. It is a case she has also made as it relates to US support for Ukraine throughout the course of her campaign.

""You know why they don't have the appetite? No one has told them why they should care. Biden hasn't said it; Congress hasn't said it. You have to overcommunicate with the American people. This is not about starting war; this is about preventing war,"" Haley said on CBS on Tuesday.

2024-02-01,Top Biden super PAC set to make $250 million investment in fall ad campaign | CNN Politics,"CNN --

The preeminent super PAC helping to reinforce President Joe Biden's reelection bid has reserved $250 million in television and digital advertising in top battleground states in hopes of carrying the message from the Democratic convention in August through Election Day.

The super PAC, Future Forward, is working with the blessing of the White House. Aides to the group said the investment marks the largest single purchase of political advertising by an outside group in campaign history.

""The stakes of this election could not be higher, and by Election Day, every battleground voter will know it,"" said Chauncey McLean, a longtime Democratic operative and president of Future Forward. ""We'll run a cost effective and data-driven program of unprecedented scale to reelect Joe Biden.""

The advertising campaign, which was first reported by The New York Times, is set to cover 10 weeks from the Democratic convention in Chicago through the election. The ads are expected to target ""lower information, less-partisan voters,"" according to a memo obtained by CNN, in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Four years ago, Biden carried all of those states, except North Carolina. But his campaign has its eye on the Tar Heel State - as an insurance policy of sorts - as it prepares for the prospect of a rematch with Donald Trump.

The memo, which lays out the group's plans for the fall campaign, said its efforts will be concentrated on trying to reach lower-information younger audiences, Spanish language media in key markets and media that over-index with African American voters.

2024-02-01,"Africa Cup of Nations: After making disastrous start, host Ivory Coast is on a roll under interim coach and win over Senegal | CNN","CNN --

If you're the defending champion heading into the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), the chances are you know that recent history isn't going to be on your side.

On Monday, current title holder Senegal was eliminated on penalties in the round of 16 by host nation Ivory Coast after 120 minutes of nail-biting action at a deafening Charles Konan Banny de Yamoussoukro Stadium.

Senegal's elimination means no defending champion has made it past the first knockout round of an AFCON since Egypt won its third straight title in 2010.

""We had a difficult start, conceding an early goal, but I told the players at half-time to keep playing the same way, not get confused,"" Ivory Coast interim coach Emerse Fae told reporters after the match.

Of all the stress, trials and tribulations that come with being thrust into the head coach position mid-tournament, Fae said his habit of taking a nap had been interrupted given his new responsibilities.

""There was a lot of pressure before the match, and match day was too long for me,"" he said. ""I couldn't nap as usual, thinking about all scenarios. If I said there was no pressure, I would be lying,""

However, for more than 80 minutes it looked as though Senegal was going to rip up the record books after Habib Diallo turned home Sadio Mané's cross after just four minutes.

Ivory Coast only squeaked through to the knockout stages as one of the best third-place teams after a dismal group stage performance, the nadir coming in a 4-0 hammering at the hands of Equatorial Guinea as the Elephants suffered their biggest ever defeat on home soil.

But the team certainly improved as Monday's match progressed and was fulling deserving of its equalizer just four minutes before full-time, even if it needed a VAR intervention.

Ivorian players and fans were incensed that referee Pierre Atcho failed to award a penalty after Senegal goalkeeper Edouard Mendy brought down former Arsenal winger Pepe in the box.

But after being sent to the pitch-side monitor to review the incident, Atcho reversed his decision and awarded the penalty, which Franck Kessié buried with confidence.

The stadium was now at fever pitch as the 20,000 fans inside the stadium began to believe.

There was nothing to separate the two teams during a nerve-shredding 30 minutes of extra-time, so the tie was to be settled via a penalty shootout.

Senegal's Moussa Niakhaté was the only player to miss during the shootout, allowing Kessié to make himself the hero for a second time as he dispatched the winning spot-kick to send his team into the quarterfinals.

It is certainly rather surprising that this team in turmoil has now made it this far in the competition.

Former Ivory Coast coach Jean-Louis Gasset was remarkably sacked during the tournament after that 4-0 defeat to Equatorial Guinea, as the team stood on the brink of an early elimination on home soil. Only Morocco's 1-0 victory over Zambia spared the team a premature exit.

However, Fae has now masterminded an unlikely win over the reigning champion and a team that cruised through the group stages with three wins from three.

""Qualifying after Morocco's win gave us confidence. We beat Senegal and eliminated them; morale is good,"" said Fae.

""We must not stop here; we must continue working, maintain this morale, and keep playing match by match,"" the coach asserted.

Ivory Coast will now play either Mali or Burkina Faso in the quarterfinals.","Senegal eliminated on penalties by host nation Ivory Coast in the round of 16.

2024-02-01,Nikola Jokić posts a triple double to lead the Denver Nuggets over the Milwaukee Bucks in Doc Rivers' debut | CNN,"CNN --

Doc Rivers took to the sideline for the first time as head coach of the Milwaukee Bucks on Monday, but his debut was spoiled by the Denver Nuggets, as Milwaukee fell to 113-107 defeat against the defending champion.

As first reported by CNN Sport, Rivers agreed to a deal with the Bucks last week, leaving his role as an analyst at ESPN to replace Adrian Griffin as head coach.

In the first game of his 25th season on the NBA sidelines, Rivers' squad was unable to contain the dominant play of two-time MVP Nikola Jokić.

The 28-year-old Serbian posted 25 points, 16 rebounds and 12 assists to lead the Nuggets with his league-high 14th triple-double of the season.

The game was tight throughout, featuring 12 ties and nine lead changes, though Denver was able to pull away in the clutch - defined by the NBA as the final five minutes of a game separated by five points or fewer - outscoring the Bucks 15-10 to win a thriller.

""To be honest, that's why we play,"" Jokić said after the game. ""I mean, that's why I play. To play this kind of game. To play under the pressure. To play tight games. I think that's what every player's dream is. I love to play under those circumstances.""

Though Jokić was the Nuggets' offensive hub as usual, it was his Denver co-star Jamal Murray that led the team in scoring, racking up 35 points on 13-of-22 shooting to go along with five assists.

Two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo led the way for Milwaukee, scoring 29 points and grabbing 12 rebounds. Brook Lopez and Damian Lillard had 19 and 18 points respectively as the Bucks fell just short.

""I thought tonight was an offensive loss,"" said Rivers. ""I didn't think we were crisp offensively. We had stretches where the ball was humming and hopping, and then we had stretches where it didn't. Those stretches we have to clean up.""

The decision to dismiss Griffin and bring in Rivers was somewhat surprising, given that the Bucks had second-best record in the league at 30-13 at the time of Griffin's firing, though there had been some on-court struggles, particularly on the defensive end.

Though Milwaukee could not get over the line against Denver, Rivers was pleased with his squad's effort and described his team as ""very coachable.""

""The fight is there. That is something really encouraging moving forward,"" said the 62-year-old.

The Bucks' record now stands at 32-15 after Monday's loss, with the 2021 champions occupying the second seed in the Eastern Conference. Their next matchup is a big one, as Lillard returns to Portland to take on the Trail Blazers, the franchise that drafted him and where he spent 11 seasons of his career.

2024-02-01,US figure skater Nathan Chen welcomes 'a win for clean sport' as Kamila Valieva's ban hands him an Olympic gold medal | CNN,"CNN --

After enduring a near-two-year wait, figure skating star Nathan Chen will finally receive a gold medal as a member of the US team at the Beijing Olympics.

The US team's upgraded position on the podium comes after Kamila Valieva's four-year ban for a positive drug test prior to the 2022 Winter Games, though Chen says that any joy is tempered by the reasons behind the delay.

""This decision is certainly a win for clean sport,"" Chen, a three-time world champion who also won gold in the men's singles event in Beijing, told CNN This Morning on Tuesday. ""However, the fact that this happened at all is a win for no one.""

The Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) had initially finished first in the team event in Beijing, but the 17-year-old Valieva's ban, linked to a positive sample recorded before the Games, means that her results from the team event have been disqualified.

""We competed clean for the entirety of our careers,"" added Chen. ""Every substance that we put in our bodies is cleared before we even consider actually taking them. Without clean sport, the integrity of the sport is diminished.""

Valieva was only 15 when she tested positive for trimetazidine, a heart medication which can boost endurance. Her doping ban is backdated to December 25, 2021, when the positive sample was collected.

Following her disqualification from the team event in Beijing, the International Skating Union (ISU) moved the ROC down to the bronze medal position and kept Canada in fourth place, one point behind the ROC.

In a statement on Tuesday, Skate Canada said it ""strongly disagrees"" with the ISU's decision to leave its team in fourth place and said it ""will consider all options to appeal this decision.""

Japan moved up to silver behind Team USA, which included Chen, Vincent Zhou, Karen Chen, Alexa Knierim, Brandon Frazier, Madison Chock, Evan Bates, Madison Hubbell, and Zachary Donohue.

""I'm just so excited for this team,"" Chen said. ""This team has shown so much dedication throughout their entire career and I don't know any group of people that deserves this more.

""They've all held themselves incredibly well through this time of indecision and represented themselves and the US well.""

The 24-year-old Chen hasn't competed since the 2022 Winter Olympics, though he hasn't ruled out a return to the ice at some point.

""I still find myself at the rink and it's always a good time to find myself back out there,"" he said. ""We'll see what happens, but right now I'm very excited to see where the sport is going.""

Also on Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Valieva remains an Olympic champion to Russia.

""We do not agree with these decisions - neither with the decision of the court, nor with the decision of the [skating] federation. We do not accept them,"" Peskov told reporters on a conference call.

""Upon returning from China - from the Olympics - we honored these athletes as Olympic champions,"" he added. ""We are convinced that for us, they will always remain Olympic champions. No matter what decisions are made in this regard, even unfair ones.""

2024-02-01,Trimetazidine: What is the competition-banned drug that Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva tested positive for? | CNN,"Kamila Valieva was banned for four years for testing positive for trimetazidine - but what exactly is the drug and what does it do?

CNN --

A doping saga that has rumbled on since the 2022 Winter Olympic Games finally reached a conclusion on Monday.

Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva received a four-year ban from competition and saw her results since Christmas Day 2021 disqualified after Switzerland's Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said that the 17-year-old had been found guilty of an anti-doping violation after testing positive for the illegal drug trimetazidine in 2021.

The ban is backdated to December 25, 2021, which is when the sample was collected. Valieva was only 15 years old at the time.

The results of the test only came to light during the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing, where Valieva had helped lead the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) - the neutral banner that Russian athletes were required to compete under after wider allegations of doping - to first place.

The ROC's position has since been recalculated and ranked as third with the United States and Japan now being awarded the gold and silver medals.

But what exactly is the drug that triggered a high-profile doping scandal and eventually led to Valieva's ban and disqualification?

What is trimetazidine and what is it used for?

According to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), trimetazidine ""is a medicine used to prevent angina attacks, which are sudden pains to the chest, jaw and back brought on by physical effort, due to reduced blood flow to the heart.""

It has an effect on metabolism - where the body breaks down substances in order to convert them into energy. It increases the rate at which glucose is broken down, allowing it to be used to protect against myocardial ischaemia - reduced blood supply to the heart muscle - according to the EMA.

The EMA also states that it has been used to treat vertigo, tinnitus and reduced vision due to problems affecting the blood vessels.

It has been readily available in medicines in Europe since the 1970s and is marketed under the brand name Vastarel. Trimetazidine is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for clinical use in the United States.

What are the effects on sports performance and why is it banned?

Trimetazidine is not well known as a doping drug in the US, but it is included on the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) 2024 list of prohibited substances and has been since the 2014 edition of the document.

It is listed as a ""metabolic modulator"" and its use by athletes is banned, both in and out of competition.

Though it would not increase heart rate, unlike other performance-enhancing drugs that are classed as stimulants, it is believed that trimetazidine can help with endurance in physical activity.

""What this drug does is actually make your heart work more efficiently,"" Dr. Elizabeth Murray, pediatric emergency medicine physician at the University of Rochester Medical Center, told CNN's Early Start program in 2022. ""It doesn't change your blood pressure very much or change your heart rate.

""An athlete wouldn't get jittery or necessarily feel all that different, but they would theoretically be able to perform at a higher level for longer. It would increase their endurance, potentially.""

Previously, the best-known case involving the drug was when Chinese swimmer Sun Yang was handed a three-month suspension in 2014 after testing positive for trimetazidine.

Illegal metabolic modulators have been used by athletes in a variety of sports, including cycling, boxing and weightlifting and from dozens of countries including Russia, Poland, Colombia, Belgium and Germany. Former tennis world No. 1 Maria Sharapova was notably suspended in 2016 after testing positive for meldonium.

According to Murray, trimetazidine would not normally be given to children like Valieva ""unless there's a very good reason.""

What are the potential side effects?

The common side effects of trimetazidine, which can affect up to 1 in 10 people, are non-dangerous and include ""gastrointestinal distress, tremors and weakness,"" according to the National Capital Poison Center.

Serious side effects could include ""Parkinsonian symptoms, involuntary muscle movements, and difficulty walking,"" according to the poison center.

In 2012, the EMA completed a review into the safety and effectiveness of trimetazidine, after the French medicines regulatory agency reported that patients who had taken the drug experienced symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as tremor (shaking), muscle rigidity and walking disorders and restless legs syndrome.

""These symptoms were seen in some patients with no previous history of Parkinson syndrome, and in many cases their symptoms resolved when they stopped taking trimetazidine,"" according to the the EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use.

The EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use eventually concluded that ""benefits continue to outweigh the risks"" in patients with issues relating to angina.

However, for use in treating tinnitus, vertigo and vision problems, ""the benefits no longer outweigh the risks and the CHMP recommended that these uses should no longer be authorized.""","Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva was banned for four years for testing positive for trimetazidine.

Kansas City Chiefs star defender Charles Omenihu looks set to miss this year's Super Bowl after sustaining an injury in Sunday's AFC Championship Game against the Baltimore Ravens.

Amid reports the defensive end had torn his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), the Chiefs star posted a number of times on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Monday which appeared to confirm the injury.

He first posted an emoji of a broken heart, before reacting with a heart emoji in response to NFL Network's Brian Baldinger reporting the news about his ACL injury.

In a separate post on X, Omenihu wrote a message to his fans.

""Thank you all for the support. God makes no mistakes. We were all a witness to my adversity earlier this year, and I came back better than ever,"" he said, likely referring to a suspension he served earlier this season.

""I promise it will be no different this time. Football, 90 [Omenihu's jersey number] will see you again till then much love to everyone and God bless.""

On Monday, NFL Network and Bleacher Report reported Omenihu had suffered the ACL tear and would miss the big game. Both credited an unnamed source.

CNN has reached out to the Kansas City Chiefs for comment.

Omenihu joined the Chiefs as a free agent this season after spells at both the Houston Texans and the San Francisco 49ers.

The 26-year-old has played a pivotal role with seven sacks in 11 regular season games.

He had a strip sack of Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson on Sunday before leaving the field through injury.

Omenihu's teammate Chris Jones posted a message on X in response to the news.

""Praying for my brotha Charles,"" he wrote, alongside a broken-heart emoji.

2024-02-01,Opinion: Why Megyn Kelly's fake feminism is so chilling | CNN,"Editor's Note: Holly Thomas is a writer and editor based in London. She is morning editor at Katie Couric Media. She tweets @HolstaT. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion on CNN.

CNN --

In June 2021, as America reeled in the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection, commentator Jonathan Rauch described former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon's media strategy thus:

""This is not about persuasion; This is about disorientation.""

Holly Thomas Holly Thomas

In a sentence, Rauch encapsulated an approach that's become increasingly popular among much of the right. Rather than follow a clear line of reasoning, zigzag back and forth between arguments. Rather than offer one explanation for any given event, offer several. And perhaps most effectively of all, co-opt the ideas and language of the left to cut through to an ever larger, ever more confused audience. It's not about persuasion, it's about disorientation.

We've seen examples of this across many of the most debated news stories and political debates of the past few years. The hypocrisy of billionaire and former President Donald Trump raging against the elites, the crass inhumanity of anti-maskers invoking George Floyd's final words during their protests and the weird, inside-out logic of purported feminists arguing against women's reproductive rights, to name a few.

This week, a new example came into view. The unsubstantiated, misleading misogyny of former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's tirade about the harm plastic surgery does to women.

It went like this. Toward the end of a recent episode of ""The Megyn Kelly Show,"" a SiriusXM program that also streams on YouTube, Kelly pulled up what she said was a ""relatively recent"" photo of ""The Boys"" actress Erin Moriarty. She cooed over how ""beautiful"" Moriarty was -- ""so beautiful that she was becoming a very famous Hollywood actress.""

Kelly then pulled up a second image of Moriarty, this time wearing very different makeup. She declared that the actress had ""completely changed her face."" Kelly lamented what she described as Moriarty's new ""Kim Kardashian lips,"" a nose ""so skinny it looks like a pencil now"" and ""what appear to me to be cheek implants."" ""I'm starting -- not to pick on this Moriarty gal,"" she said. But ""more and more young women are doing this.... It's not about an objection to plastic surgery. It's about an obsession with turning yourself into this fake version of yourself.""

The next several minutes were spent conferring with her guest, the conservative political commentator Michael Knowles, about the second photograph and its apparent implications. Kelly suggested that Moriarty's apparent ""obsession"" was a sign of ""mental illness."" Knowles agreed, adding that they denoted a social media-driven ""hyper-reality"" that drove women to alter their appearances until they look ""grotesque.""

The only element of Knowles' analysis that Kelly disagreed with was his view that women almost never look better after plastic surgery. ""I've seen a lot of women benefit from, in particular, nose jobs,"" she mused, before reemphasizing her belief that Moriarty and women like her have a ""mental disorder."" Finally, she confessed to having wondered initially whether the second photo was ""an AI-generated face.""

It was, of course, nonsense. But it was nonsense that caused Moriarty herself very real distress. Over the weekend, Moriarty posted a detailed response to her Instagram page. She said that since Kelly's show had aired, she'd ""BARELY been able to eat and sleep."" She pointed out that the alleged ""before"" photo, which Kelly claimed had been taken about a year ago, was in fact about a decade old. The comments made during the segment, Moriarty stressed, were ""disgustingly false,"" and ""counterproductive to the degree of being ironically misogynistic."" A representative for Kelly did not respond to multiple outlets' requests for comment.

""Ironically misogynistic"" is exactly right. Throughout her segment on Moriarty, Kelly latched onto what might, in other hands, under other circumstances, have been sympathetic and important themes. She flagged mental health, the pressures put on women by social media and the beauty industry and the struggle to remain authentic in an increasingly ""fake,"" AI-dominated world.

In Kelly's hands, however, those ideas were twisted. Mental illness wasn't suggested in terms of sympathy or curiosity, but condemnation. The beauty industry wasn't the target, nor, more importantly, the patriarchal, capitalist systems that fuel it. But the women who fail (in her opinion) to look ""classy"" were. And, as Moriarty pointed out, the entire basis for Kelly's argument -- that she'd drastically altered her appearance in a very short space of time -- was utterly misconstrued.

Unfortunately for Moriarty, the damage is done. Observers posted vicious comments about her appearance. Moriarty said she would be taking ""an extensive if not permanent break"" from social media and in her words, she experienced ""one of the most challenging weeks"" of her life. So much for Kelly's concerns about her mental health.

Moriarty's peace of mind is not the only potential casualty, though. As history has proven, the more such sensitive themes and language are used so disingenuously, the harder it becomes for those who mean well to deploy them sincerely and effectively.

As author and social activist Naomi Klein wrote in her book ""Doppelganger: A Trip into the Mirror World"" when discussing how anti-vaxxers co-opted the phrase ""bodily integrity:"" ""Abusing such terms is dangerous: it drains them of their intended meaning, their legibility, and power."" To apply the principle in this instance: the more people like Megyn Kelly use phrases like ""mental illness"" to underpin their prejudiced, callous thinking, the harder it becomes to have a sensible, empathetic discussion using that same language.

2024-02-01,An atmospheric river is set to drench Southern California Thursday before another sweeps in over the weekend | CNN,"CNN --

The first of two atmospheric rivers expected to lash Southern California will strike the region Thursday, bringing gusty winds and heavy rainfall that could lead to flooding in some areas.

More than 20 million people across California are under flood alerts Thursday into Friday morning as storms threaten flash flooding in cities including San Diego, Sacramento, San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland.

And while there may be a brief respite after Thursday's storm drenches Southern California, another atmospheric river - likely stronger - is poised to move across the region beginning Sunday.

Rainy conditions are expected to continue well into next month as a more typical El Niño pattern kicks into gear.

El Niño - a natural phenomenon in the tropical Pacific that influences weather around the globe - causes changes in the jet stream that can point storms directly at California. Storms can also tap into an extra-potent supply of moisture from the tropics called an atmospheric river.

On Wednesday, the first of two atmospheric river storms slammed into Northern California. As the storm began to shift south, central California saw steady and rain begin Wednesday afternoon, which will continue into Thursday.

Areas north of San Luis Obispo to the California-Oregon state line, which includes the Bay Area, are expected to see the heaviest rainfall through the overnight hours.

By Thursday morning, steady rainfall and periods of stronger winds are expected to begin impacting Southern California. Much cooler air will also begin to overspread the state.

Rainfall of 1 to 4 inches is possible in the southern part of the state, falling at rates that could exceed 1 inch per hour.

A Level 2 out of 4 risk of excessive rainfall is in place Thursday for Southern California as the rain moves south, according to the Weather Prediction Center. Roads and low-lying areas are at the most risk for flooding, and rises on some waterways are also possible.

Flood watches across central California are expected to remain in effect through Thursday evening. Rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are possible, with isolated totals exceeding 4 inches possible.

Meanwhile, the western half of California could see a few thunderstorms that may produce bursts of heavier rain. This would come after a series of torrential thunderstorms wreaked havoc on San Diego last week.

To respond to potential impacts, California officials are readying hundreds of crew members from multiple agencies to respond to potential calls for rescue, according to a Tuesday news release from the governor's office.

""The state is working around the clock with our local partners to deploy life-saving equipment and resources statewide,"" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said.

California's Office of Emergency Services said it has prepared swift water personnel and equipment in 12 counties to respond when needed.

More than 400 personnel have been prepositioned across 16 California counties, according to the state's office of emergency services.

Snow is also a threat

Farther north, officials are also preparing to respond to a bout of wintery weather conditions.

More snow is expected to accumulate at lower elevations across parts of Northern California and the Sierra Nevada on Thursday as cooler temperatures move in. Feet of snow could bury the highest peaks of the Sierras, with at least 6 inches of snow possible for some lower-elevation mountain roadways.

Winter storm warnings remain in effect for the Sierra Nevada, where up to 4 feet of snow are possible in some higher elevations.

The snow is welcomed for California's snowpack, which has been beleaguered by warmth and storms that have brought more rain than snow. This winter's snowpack is just 52% of average for this time of year, according to the latest survey conducted by the state's Department of Water Resources Tuesday. Snowpack is a vital water source, and the survey helps California to forecast how much water will be available for the remainder of the year.

'Largest storm of the season' to begin this weekend

Friday will bring showery weather that's expected to linger over much of California as moisture slowly pushes out and across the Southwest.

Then on Sunday, another more potent atmospheric river-fueled storm is poised to lash Southern California. That could become the ""largest storm of the season,"" the National Weather Service in Los Angeles warned.

""It is very likely that this will be a serious 2 to 3 day storm system,"" meteorologists there said.

While more details on this storm are still coming into focus, forecast models show a more widespread and prolonged flood threat, especially for Southern California. At the very least, another few days of rain and snow are likely across the rest of the state.

The second storm could potentially stall over the region and unload several inches of rain from Sunday to about midweek.

Temperatures are also likely to start out much cooler with this storm than with the first storm, with more snow possible down to mountain pass levels or potentially even lower elevations.

CNN Meteorologist Robert Shackelford and CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","More than 20 million people across California are under flood alerts.

2024-02-01,"Light on weight, heavy on value: Here's why the Adventurist Classic backpack is a hit | CNN Underscored","There's fierce competition for the best travel backpack, and it's clear that the Denver-based Adventurist Backpack Co. means business with its signature bag.

As a weekly air traveler, I'm always on the lookout for a stylish and durable backpack to accompany my carry-on luggage. Specifically, I look for a backpack that can comfortably accommodate my laptop, toiletries, charging cables, reusable water bottle and other travel must-haves.

Most importantly, since schlepping through airports can get tiresome, an ultra-lightweight bag is a must.

The Adventurist Classic ticks all these boxes and comes packed with features, all while Adventurist Backpack Co. provides 25 meals to families in need in the US for each backpack it sells.

Here's a closer look at some of our favorite features of the Adventurist Classic backpack and why you might consider it for your next backpack.

What we liked about it

Kyle Olsen/CNN Underscored

Simplicity on the go

Bags like the viral Coowoz Large Travel backpack (which my colleague loved) offer tons of organizational compartments. This can be helpful if you're trying to get away on a trip with only a backpack, but that's not what the Adventurist Classic is designed for.

Instead, this bag is all about getting the basics right, and that's one of the reasons I love the bag. It has a large zipper storage compartment and two side water bottle pockets. The openness of the storage compartment means I can fit easily everything from books to a tablet in the bag without having to fit things in a specific pocket.

There's also a small front pocket that I used for storing chargers and loose change. While it can accommodate a passport or wallet, I prefer a more secure location for storing these valuables.

The main storage compartment has a 16-liter capacity and a padded sleeve that can fit a 15-inch laptop. In my testing, I found the bag can hold two 15-inch laptops back-to-back, but it's a good idea to put one in a case to avoid scratching.

Super lightweight

Kyle Olsen/CNN Underscored

The Adventurist Classic weighs just 1 pound when empty. This makes the backpack one of the lightest options in its class, something that road warriors and commuters will appreciate during endless trips through airports and train stations.

Easy to open and close

Kyle Olsen/CNN Underscored

The Adventurist Classic has two synthetic leather straps that connect to magnetic snaps. They're stylish and easy to open and close, though the magnetic snaps are just another step when quickly opening or closing the bag on the go.

That said, the bag features premium YKK zippers that secure both the main compartment and smaller front pocket. These move freely and feel sturdy even when the bag is filled to the brim.

Padding and durability

Kyle Olsen/CNN Underscored

The Adventurist Classic is made from a durable and water-resistant 1000D polyester material. There's also padding in the front and back of the bag, which protect its contents, maintains the bag's shape and makes carrying the bag more comfortable.

Three sizes to choose from

Kyle Olsen/CNN Underscored

The Adventurist Classic is the company's signature, medium-sized backpack. But if you're looking for something smaller or larger, the Adventurist has your back with its larger Weekender backpack and smaller Safari backpack, which have similar styles to the Adventurist Classic.

A company on a mission

The company partners with Feeding America to buy excess produce from farmers, combating food waste, supporting local agriculture and feeding families throughout the country. Adventurist Backpack Co. donates 25 meals for each backpack sold.

What we didn't like about it

Limited interior space

To get to just 1 pound, the Adventurist Classic offers 16 liters of storage space. Compared to other travel backpacks in its class, it falls on the smaller side.

Take, for instance, the Away F.A.R Backpack, which has a larger storage capacity of 26 liters and more interior organization. However, the bag is bulkier and more expensive at $130.

In my view, the Adventurist Classic strikes a balance between having acceptable capacity for light travelers and being attractively priced. Nonetheless, travelers who require more space without opting for a larger backpack may want to explore other options.

Won't hold larger water bottles

Kyle Olsen/CNN Underscored

The Adventurist Classic backpack features dual water bottle holders, positioned on either side of the backpack. These pockets are specifically designed to accommodate water bottles with a diameter of less than four inches.

In the provided image, a narrow and tall 20-ounce water bottle, borrowed from a friend, is showcased. While this particular bottle fits snugly, larger water bottles may not fit in the side pockets since the pockets lack elasticity.

2024-02-01,"The US, Russia and China are in a race to dominate new-wave nuclear energy  --  and win global influence | CNN","CNN --

Off the Siberian coast, not far from Alaska, a Russian ship has been docked at port for four years. The Akademik Lomonosov, the world's first floating nuclear power plant, sends energy to around 200,000 people on land using next-wave nuclear technology: small modular reactors.

This technology is also being used below sea level. Dozens of US submarines lurking in the depths of the world's oceans are propelled by SMRs, as the compact reactors are known.

SMRs -- which are smaller and less costly to build than traditional, large-scale reactors -- are fast becoming the next great hope for a nuclear renaissance as the world scrambles to cut fossil fuels. And the US, Russia and China are battling for dominance to build and sell them.

The Biden administration and American companies are plowing billions of dollars into SMRs in a bid for business and global influence. China is leading in nuclear technology and construction, and Russia is making almost all the world's SMR fuel. The US is playing catch-up on both.

There's no mystery behind why the US wants in on the market. It already lost the wind and solar energy race to China, which now provides most of the world's solar panels and wind turbines. The big problem: The US hasn't managed to get an SMR working commercially on land.

SMRs are potentially an enormous global market that could bring money and jobs to the US, which is trying to sell entire fleets of reactors to countries, rather than the bespoke, large-scale power plants that notoriously go over budget and way past deadline.

While SMRs provide less energy -- typically a third of a traditional plant -- they require less space and can be built in more places. They are made up of small parts that can be easily delivered and assembled on site, like a nuclear plant flatpack.

Most countries are trying to rapidly decarbonize their energy systems to address the climate crisis. Wind and solar now provide at least 12% of the world's power, and in some places, like the European Union, they provide more than fossil fuels. But there's an increasing sense of urgency to clean up our energy systems as extreme weather events wreak havoc on the planet and as challenges with renewables remain.

For some experts, nuclear energy -- in all forms, large or small -- has an important role to play in that transition. The International Energy Agency, which outlined what many experts say is the world's most realistic plan to decarbonize, sees a need to more than double nuclear energy by 2050.

""There's definitely a huge race on,"" said Josh Freed, who leads the Climate and Energy Program at the think tank Third Way. ""China and Russia have more agreements to build all sorts of reactors overseas than the US does. That's what the US needs to catch up on.""

A nuclear renaissance

The US is trying to sell SMR technology to countries that have never used nuclear power in their histories. To convince them that SMRs are a good option, they'll need to pitch hard on safety.

Globally, the construction of conventional nuclear power plants dipped following the Chernobyl meltdown in 1986. They fell again after Japan's Fukushima disaster in 2011, mainly buoyed by a slew of new projects in China, data from the World Nuclear Industry Status Report shows.

Most of the world has been cold on nuclear for the past decade or so.

But a nuclear renaissance is coming, the IEA says. The organization predicts nuclear power generation globally will reach an all-time high in 2025. That's because several traditional nuclear plants in Japan that were put on pause after Fukushima will soon be restarted, and new reactors in China, India, South Korea and Europe will start operating.

It seems that decades-old fears over the safety of nuclear are starting to fade, and people -- or their governments at least -- are weighing the benefits against the risks, including the problem of storing radioactive waste, which can remain dangerous for thousands of years. That could create a more hospitable market for countries looking to export SMRs.

If SMRs help boost the popularity of nuclear energy, they could become a powerful way to address climate change. Nuclear power, generally, doesn't emit planet-warming carbon pollution when used and generates more energy per square meter of land use than any fossil fuel or renewable, according to an analysis by Our World in Data.

At the COP28 climate talks in Dubai in December, the US led a pledge to triple the world's nuclear energy capacity, which 25 nations have now signed onto. And the US government has earmarked $72 million to its international SMR program, known as FIRST, to provide countries with a whole suite of tools -- from workshops to engineering and feasibility studies -- to provide them with everything they need to buy an SMR fleet made in America.

But bigger money is coming in the form of loans from state financial institutions, like the US Export-Import Bank and its International Development Finance Corporation, which have offered up $3 billion and $1 billion, respectively. Those have gone to two SMRs in Poland designed by GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, a US-Japanese partnership headquartered in North Carolina.

The US and American companies are also finding success in Southeast Asia -- a region where many countries are seeking to loosen their ties with China -- as well as central and eastern Europe, where some nations that depend on Russian gas are trying to cut their reliance on Vladimir Putin's increasingly hostile nation.

These efforts could threaten Russia's ambitions abroad. Russia has already built or designed nuclear plants -- the traditional type -- for China, India, Bangladesh, Turkey, Slovakia, Egypt and Iran. Russia is also courting countries with the Akademik Lomonosov in Siberia: The CEO of Russia's state-owned nuclear company said last year that dozens of countries had expressed interest in Russian-made floating SMRs.

Russia has another edge: its state nuclear company supplies almost all the world's demand for SMR fuel -- enriched uranium known as HALEU.

But the US and UK, among others, are investing in their own fuel production at home. That's essential -- two SMR demonstration projects, one by X-energy in Washington and another by Bill Gates' TerraPower in Wyoming, were awarded government support to get up and running by 2028. They will need fuel to do so.

China isn't building many nuclear plants abroad but as the only country to have an SMR in operation on land, it's in a good position to win a large share of the market.

It's very difficult for American nuclear energy companies to compete with those from countries like Russia and China, which have state-run utilities that don't have to prove their power is economical.

""Our nuclear vendors are competing against cheap, natural gas in the US,"" said Kirsten Cutler, a Senior Strategist for Nuclear Energy Innovation at the US State Department. ""Abroad, they're competing against authoritarian-backed entities who are throwing in a lot of political pressure and package deals.""

But Cutler points out that nuclear deals create decades-long relationships with other countries that require trust and benefit from stability.

""Who are you going to have that relationship with? Countries recognize the risks of working with authoritarian-backed suppliers and seek partners that will strengthen their independence and their energy security,"" Cutler said. ""These are not trivial decisions. They're really important 50 to 100-year decisions, and they seek the United States.""

Flexing diplomatic muscle

If the US intends to prove it can deliver an SMR, it's not unreasonable to expect the technology to be economically viable -- something the country is struggling to show.

In 2020, Oregon-based NuScale's SMR design was the first in the country to win regulatory approval. But it announced in November 2023 it was pulling the plug on an Idaho-based demonstration project that could have ushered in the next wave of SMRs. Its costs had nearly doubled, which sent its power prices soaring to a point the company wouldn't have been able to sell it.

Much like large-scale nuclear plants, NuScale's primary issue was high costs, as already expensive building supplies converged with tight supply chains, inflation and high interest rates.

It was a major blow to the argument that SMRs would be cheaper and faster to build than traditional reactors.

""It certainly dampens the excitement abroad,"" said John Parsons, a senior lecturer at MIT and a financial economist focused on nuclear energy. ""It makes a big difference in the marketing if the US is out there making it happen. Then people who are interested in nuclear have an easier case in their country.""

NuScale didn't respond to an interview request from CNN. In a November statement, the company expressed confidence it could keep and find other customers for its power domestically and abroad.

The US is trying to flex its muscle in diplomatic circles to win this race, too.

US climate envoy John Kerry was among the most vocal supporters of nuclear energy at the COP28 climate summit. And according to an analysis by climate consultancy InfluenceMap, the US was the only foreign country to lobby the European Union to include nuclear power in its official list of energy sources the bloc considers ""green,"" and therefore eligible for central funding. The State Department said it does not comment on diplomatic activities when asked to confirm its lobbying.

While the US nuclear industry struggles with budgets and timelines, its rigorous approach to projects may have some payoff.

European allies, for example, trust the US' Nuclear Regulatory Commission, particularly on safety standards, the Third Way's Freed said. If an SMR is licensed by the NRC and built in the US, then it ""gets the gold seal"" of approval from other countries, he added.

But if the US wants to really make nuclear energy from SMRs more economically viable, it will have to take a look at its fossil fuel production.

""The target here is to produce electricity cheaper than coal and gas plants,"" Parsons said. These fossil fuel plants are ""terribly simple and cheap to run -- they're just dirty,"" he added.

Even if there can be a dramatic takeoff in the US' SMR industry, it will still take years to scale up. It will probably take until the end of this decade to even glean whether it's viable, said Mohammed Hamdaoui, vice president of renewables and power at research firm Rystad Energy.

And that's a problem -- the scientific consensus is that the world needs to make deep sustained cuts to carbon pollution this decade to ward off catastrophic climate change.

""I don't see it being a big player in the energy mix until the second part of the next decade,"" Hamdaoui said. ""It's going to take time.""","US, Russia and China are battling for dominance to build and sell SMRs.

2024-02-01,Tom Brady speaks about the 'respect' he has for Patrick Mahomes and Brock Purdy ahead of Super Bowl LVIII | CNN,"CNN --

Tom Brady knows a thing or two about winning. Following his retirement from the NFL, Patrick Mahomes appears to be the heir-apparent to that winning pedigree.

The 28-year-old is on the brink of winning his third title after guiding the Kansas City Chiefs to Super Bowl LVIII where they will face the San Francisco 49ers in Las Vegas on February 11.

He's still a way off Brady's seven Super Bowl rings, but for some, the Kansas City QB is a serious rival to Brady's 'Greatest Of All Time' tag.

Although comparisons are being made between the two quarterbacks, Brady said there is space in the NFL discourse for both to shine for their own reasons.

""There's nothing that Patrick can do, in my opinion, that takes away from what I tried to accomplish in my career and there's nothing that I did [that] can take away from what he's trying to accomplish,"" the 46-year-old said on 'The Pat McAfee Show' on Tuesday.

""I feel like I tried to be the best I could be and, even though I had sporting idols, like I said, I could never be Steve Young. I could never be Joe Montana. I could never be Dan Marino or John Elway. Those were my childhood idols and they had incredible careers and they put as much as they could into their career and I really respect that. And I just try to do the same thing.

""And believe me, if anybody can go out there and win seven Super Bowls, I have so much respect for them. I understand how difficult it is. I will congratulate them and I'm going to give whoever it is a big hug.""

Like many of Brady's Super Bowl runs with the New England Patriots and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the 2023 trek for Chiefs has been one of sheer determination.

Kansas City's season has been fraught with offensive issues, yet the team finds itself in its second successive Super Bowl, primarily on the back of Mahomes' brilliance in the postseason.

But Mahomes isn't the only quarterback in the Super Bowl who has impressed.

Niners signal caller Brock Purdy has blossomed into a high-level quarterback in his second year in the league, having been drafted with the final pick of last year's NFL draft.

San Francisco head coach Kyle Shanahan has developed a potent offense around Purdy, and Brady was also keen to praise last season's 'Mr. Irrelevant.'

""Brock's done a great job with the opportunity. You know he got it and he's taken advantage of it,"" he said. ""He was a late round pick. I know he's got a chip on his shoulder and he wants to go out there and prove every day that he's the right fit for that team. It's a great organization they're running. I really respect Kyle (Shanahan), but Brock's done a hell of a job.""

Career change

While the next generation of quarterbacks is preparing for the biggest game of the NFL season, Brady is getting ready for the next stage of his own career.

After 23 years playing the sport at the highest level, Brady is moving upstairs to the commentary booth having agreed to a deal shortly after retiring to join Fox Sports as their lead analyst.

The terms of Brady's deal with Fox Sports were never disclosed, but media reports said he agreed to a 10-year contract worth $375 million.

Speaking on Tuesday, Brady expressed his excitement at getting started next season, particularly as he will have the opportunity to cover the Super Bowl next year - with host broadcaster Fox - in New Orleans, the city he won his first title in 2002.

""I'm gonna go in there with the opportunity to start and learn, and I'm sure by the end of the year, I'll feel more comfortable,"" Brady said.

""So there's some really cool things that as I thought about taking that opportunity is something that I really want to be a great ambassador for the NFL in the game.""","Tom Brady says Patrick Mahomes is a rival to Brady's 'Greatest Of All Time' tag.

2024-02-01,Europe is braced for a showdown on money on Ukraine | CNN,"Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban pictured in Brussels, Belgium in December 2023.

CNN --

Leaders of the 27 member states of the European Union will meet in Brussels on Thursday and try to unlock €50 billion of funding for Ukraine that was blocked by Hungary in December, in a crucial summit at a pivotal moment in the war.

Failure to reach an agreement would mark a major blow to Ukraine, at a time when outmanned and outgunned Ukrainian forces are struggling on the battlefield in the face of a renewed Russian assault, and military aid from the United States has dried up amid an ongoing battle in Washington over future funding for Kyiv.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban says he doesn't oppose European funding for Ukraine, but is insisting that the money should not come out of the EU's budget. On Tuesday, Orban said he also thought the figure of €50 billion was too high, and repeated his demand that any deal for funding be reviewed every year. The 26 other EU leaders are opposed to those demands.

Critics of Orban have noted that the EU is currently withholding money from Hungary for breaching the bloc's rule of law requirements - fundamental values enshrined in EU treaties. It is widely suspected that Orban is using his veto on the funds for Ukraine to force Brussels into unlocking the money for Hungary. Orban and members of his government have repeatedly denied that there is any connection between the two, or that they have breached EU rules.

If Orban continues to block the €50bn, it is possible that the other 26 member states will seek an alternative arrangement outside of the EU's structures.

Brussels sources told CNN this will most likely mean individual governments sending money directly to Ukraine, rather than through the EU. They say that this is less desirable as it will be more expensive and make it harder to coordinate how the money is spent with existing EU programs in Ukraine.

There are other suggestions that the EU could generate revenue for Ukraine from frozen Russian assets within the block.

Ahead of the summit, Hungary accused Brussels of blackmail after a report in the Financial Times said that EU officials were drawing up proposals on how to hit the Hungarian economy as punishment for blocking the funding plans. Hungarian officials also say that they have sent proposals to Brussels regarding money for Ukraine.

""Brussels is using blackmail against Hungary like there's no tomorrow, despite the fact that we have proposed a compromise,"" Balázs Orbán, political director to the Hungarian prime minister wrote on X Monday, along with a picture of the FT story.

He had specifically highlighted a passage of the article that said: ""Brussels has outlined a strategy to explicitly target Hungary's economic weaknesses, imperil its currency and drive a collapse in investor confidence in a bid to hurt 'jobs and growth' if Budapest refuses to lift its veto against the aid to Kyiv.""

The FT report claimed that a document it has seen described how failure to reach an agreement on the package for Ukraine would likely lead to EU funds being withheld from Hungary, which ""could quickly trigger a further increase of the cost of funding of the public deficit and a drop in the currency"".

A senior EU official told CNN that the document cited in the FT article ""does not outline any specific plan relating to the MFF (EU budget) and Ukraine Facility, nor does it outline any plan relating to Hungary.""

Most diplomats are optimistic that some kind of deal will be done over the two-day summit, whether Hungary agrees or not. Several diplomats have told CNN that they think Hungary will ultimately be persuaded, based on the fact that until this point it has gone along with most EU and NATO initiatives for Ukraine.

It has done so despite a well-known closeness between the Hungarian PM and Russian President Vladimir Putin, even if Orban has made unhelpful, pro-Russia noises in public over the past two years.

The summit and decision on funds comes at an extremely important time in the war effort for Ukraine. There are frequent reports that the war is reaching a stalemate and that Ukraine's soldiers and leaders are exhausted. European security officials say that Ukraine is on the whole outperforming Russia on the battlefield, but that victory will require support from Western allies until the end.

There are also fears that Ukraine is slipping down the agenda of the West. This has been a concern ever since the Hamas attack on Israel last year and has been exacerbated by the widening conflict in the Middle East.

Aside from the tangible distractions, Kyiv and its allies are also acutely aware of the political changes that could happen over the next year.

European elections in June are predicted to welcome the largest-ever cohort of far-right parliamentarians to the legislative branch of the EU.

Opinion across the European right is not uniform, of course, but there are a large number of politicians on the right who are against funding Ukraine and in some cases are very pro-Russia. Current polls predict that the right will have the numbers to act as a block in the Parliament, which could make passing legislation very difficult.

Ukraine is also falling down the list of things that European citizens care about. At the start of the war, European opinion was relatively solid in its support of Ukraine and remained so for a long time. However,the conflict has now slipped in the minds of some behind issues such as economics, climate change and immigration, according to research by the European Council on Foreign Affairs published this year.

Beyond Europe, there are also major concerns about what a second Donald Trump presidency would mean for Ukraine and European security as a whole.

Trump's rhetoric during his first term caused EU and NATO officials to speak more seriously about the need for Europe to become more self-reliant in defense and security. However, Europe has not made that much progress on its long-term defense strategy.

This could make sending money and arms to Ukraine for much longer very difficult for countries who are actively trying to beef up their own forces.

Of course, there are also fears that Trump, who was seen as sympathetic to Putin during his last presidency, will try and broker a negotiation that ultimately costs Ukraine.

As the Ukraine crisis approaches the two-year mark it is becoming increasingly difficult for Europe to manage. On one hand, fatigue is raising questions about the practicality of endless support. On the other, the consequences of Ukraine losing the war could be unconscionable for the rest of Europe.",Leaders of the 27 member states of the European Union will meet in Brussels on Thursday.

2024-02-01,What to know about human brain implants | CNN,"Musk startup implanted a brain chip into a human. Gupta explains how it works

CNN --

Elon Musk's startup Neuralink implanted a computer chip in a person's brain on Sunday, he said in a post on his X platform Monday, although he offered few details. Other companies doing similar work are farther along in the research process - for example, Synchron has been enrolling and implanting people in its trial since 2021 - and consumers won't be able to access the technology any time soon. But if the technology works, it could one day benefit people who are otherwise unable to move or communicate and may have even wider-ranging applications for health. Here's what to know about brain implants.

What is a human brain implant?

Researchers say that a brain-computer interface will allow a person to use their thoughts to control a device like a computer or a phone.

How does it work?

Doctors implant these kinds of devices on the surface of the brain or deep with in it.

Neuralink's equipment is about the size of a coin; Synchron's is a small stent-like device that goes into the blood vessels in the brain. The devices include several electrodes that can't read a person's thoughts, but they essentially observe and interpret signals sent by neurons, nerve cells that use electricity and chemicals to send signals from your brain to the rest of your body to help it move, breathe, talk and eat.

""Using the recent advances in computers that came over the last 30 or 40 years, we've finally had enough processing power to build and train mathematical algorithms to make estimates of what that information might look like, and we finally have the computing power to make those estimates in real time,"" said Dr. Paul Nuyujukian, a professor of bioengineering and neurosurgery who runs the Brain Interfacing Laboratory at Stanford University.

Although the technology is newer, he said, the work builds on basic science on how the brain controls movement that scientists have understood for more than 100 years.

What makes this technology work?

Earlier technology had to be wired to a computer. Neuralinnk's device runs on a battery that can be charged wirelessly and can communicate wirelessly to the Neuralink application, which decodes the data into action and intent, according to the company. Synchron's device is connected to a telemetry unit that is hooked up to a computer.

How will these devices be used?

The initial aim is to help someone who has had a stroke or who has a motor degenerative disease like ALS or other physical problems communicate directly through the implant to an outside device like a phone, tablet or computer.

In 2021, Neuralink demonstrated how this worked with a monkey named Pager, who had two of these wireless devices implanted into its brain. The devices allowed Pager to control a cursor with its thoughts and play a game called ""mind pong.""

When will these devices be available?

""Nothing in this field happens overnight,"" Nuyujukian said. He and other academics have been working on this kind of research for decades, but technical innovation has picked up in the past five to 10 years as more neural engineering companies have gotten into the business.

However, it takes time to get devices like this through the US Food and Drug Administration approval process because ""the risk to individual safety is high,"" he said. Risks can include bleeding or infections. It often can take 10 to 20 years for a device to get approval, particularly one involving such new technology.

Nuyujukian is confident that the technology will help people in the future, though.

""There's no reason that this shouldn't be successful,"" he said. ""The science is there and sound and has been there for decades, and that gives me a lot of assurance.

2024-02-01,Welcome to the 'Death Star': Everything to know about Las Vegas' state-of-the-art Allegiant Stadium hosting Super Bowl LVIII | CNN,"CNN --

After 18 weeks of NFL regular season games and three rounds of grueling playoff action, Super Bowl LVIII is set.

The Kansas City Chiefs will face the San Francisco 49ers on February 11 to crown the 2023 season's champion.

The game will be played in Las Vegas at the Raiders' state-of-the-art Allegiant Stadium, aka the ""Death Star,"" the first time the venue - and Nevada - has hosted the NFL's championship game.

Here's everything you need to know about the host venue for this year's Super Bowl.

A new home

Opened in 2020, Allegiant Stadium was part of a monumental project spearheaded by Raiders owner Mark Davis.

He was the driving force behind the relocation of the Raiders organization - which had been historically located in Oakland, California - to the Silver State; a move which was announced in 2017 to the disgruntlement of many Bay Area-based fans.

The Raiders' new 65,000 capacity stadium was built next to the Las Vegas Strip to accommodate the team; fittingly, it is located on Al Davis Way, a street named after the team's former owner and Mark Davis' father.

The stadium was built with a domed roof and, according to Sports Illustrated, $1.9 billion to construct.

The stadium is said to brings around $620 million annually to the local area, while also creating 6,000 permanent jobs in Southern Nevada.

The turf field can be moved depending on the event being hosted in the stadium. The stadium's official website says it plays host to Raiders games as well as ""world-class entertainment including concerts and special sporting events such as the Pac-12 Championship Game and Las Vegas Bowl.""

The sliding field tray weighs 19 million pounds which is a similar weight to the Eiffel Tower, per the official website, and is moved by 72 individual motors.

Roughly 105,000 cubic yards of concrete - akin to 257 miles of sidewalk from Las Vegas to Los Angeles - were used in construction and 425 trees were planted around the stadium. A total of 28,000 tons of structural steel were used too, which is heavier than the Statue of Liberty.

The stadium includes 75,000 square feet of video boards to keep fans up to date with what's happening on the field, as well as over 2,300 televisions.

The hosting of the Super Bowl is estimated to bring in around $500 million for Las Vegas ""through direct spending, additional tax dollar generation, increased room occupancy and job creation.""

The 'Death Star'

""Welcome to the Death Star, where our opponents' dreams come to die,"" Mark Davis proclaimed ahead of the team's first scrimmage at the stadium back in 2020.

Despite not really looking anything like the doomed Death Star - a giant planet-destroying space station that is twice blown up in the original Star Wars trilogy - the name has stuck.

Others, meanwhile, have noted on social media that the stadium shares a passing resemblance to a giant Roomba vacuum, which is certainly a more accurate description than the Death Star.

Whichever nickname it ends up becoming most known by, the jokes for both write themselves.

However, back in 2020, Davis was confident his Death Star would be more successful than its ill-fated namesake.

""That was THEIR Death Star. Not ours. Ours was built to sustain,"" he told ESPN.

Former Raiders head coach Jon Gruden concurred with Davis, telling the Las Vegas Review-Journal in September 2020: ""I think it's a cool name for our stadium. I don't give a damn about Star Wars. That's what we're calling our stadium and I don't care what anybody else thinks.

""It's a cool stadium, it's a great name and we just have to play good when we're in there.""

Remembering

Similarly to the Oakland Coliseum where the team previously played its games, the Raiders constructed a large torch in Allegiant Stadium in memory of Al Davis following his death in 2011.

The initial idea for the torch was in recognition of Davis' enduring vision that ""the fire that burns brightest in the Raiders' organization is the will to win.""

Prior to each Raiders home game, legends of the organization, celebrities or fans light the torch in memory of the former owner.

The first to light the torch at Oakland Coliseum in 2011 was the organization's long-time head coach John Madden, who was hired by Davis in the 1960s andwon two Super Bowls with the team.

At the Allegiant Stadium, a 92-foot tall torch resides in the venue with Carol Davis - Al Davis' former wife and mother of current owner Mark - being the first person to light it in 2020.

With the Raiders playing home games in 2020 without fans due to the Covid pandemic, various factions of the community were thanked for their service and were given the opportunity to light the torch.

Some of the groups who lit the torch during that season included frontline medical workers, local cancer survivors, Allegiant Stadium construction workers, Southern Nevada law enforcement agencies and food bank volunteers.","The Kansas City Chiefs will face the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII.

2024-02-01,US aircraft carriers lead 'large deck' exercises with Japan east of Taiwan | CNN,"US Navy aircraft fly in formation during an exercise held in the Philippine Sea on January 31.

Seoul, South Korea CNN --

A dozen United States and Japanese warships, including two US aircraft carriers, have been putting on a show of military might this week in the Philippine Sea east of Taiwan.

Analysts say the joint exercises show the US Navy can respond to contingencies across a broad swath of Asian waters where tensions with China remain high - even while facing hostilities in the Middle East.

The US Navy aircraft carriers USS Carl Vinson and USS Theodore Roosevelt were joined by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force helicopter destroyer JS Ise, seven US guided-missile destroyers and two US cruisers for what the Navy calls a Multi-Large Deck Event (MLDE).

""The U.S. and Japan are uniquely capable of rapidly assembling multiple large-deck naval forces in support of mutual security interests in the Indo Pacific,"" Rear Adm. Carlos Sardiello, commander of the Vinson-led Carrier Strike Group 1, said in a statement.

The dozen warships conducted ""defense drills, sea surveillance, cross-deck exercises and tactical maneuvers to advance unique high-end warfighting capability,"" the US Navy statement said.

The exercises began Monday and were scheduled to conclude Thursday, according to a statement from the Japanese military.

Collin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said while exercises occur regularly in the area, the timing of this show of force is important.

""There had been earlier trepidations that the Mideast flareups would draw a US strategic refocus away from the Western Pacific,"" Koh said.

Video Ad Feedback A global ""balance of power is being tested,"" says former US diplomat 03:48 - Source: CNN

""This was seen as a demonstration of US commitment to its strategic focus on the region despite what happens in the Mideast,"" he added, noting that a third US aircraft carrier in Asia-Pacific, the USS Ronald Reagan, is now in Japan.

Meanwhile, according to the USNI Fleet Tracker, only one US carrier - the USS Dwight D Eisenhower - is in the Middle East, where Houthi rebels have sustained a series of attacks on US naval assets and commercial shipping in the Red Sea, despite multiple US and British strikes on the group's infrastructure inside Yemen.

Hawaii-based analyst Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center, said staging the joint exercises in the Philippine Sea shows the US Navy can get forces quickly to areas where China's naval units have been active in recent months.

""As an exercise, it demonstrates the mobility of aircraft carriers. Geopolitically, it also highlights the carrier's ability to support a range of contingencies across a broad area,"" Schuster said.

Potential maritime flashpoints

That broad area reaches as far south as islands and reefs in the South China Sea, where Chinese and Philippine vessels have been in recent confrontations. It also extends west to the democratically ruled island of Taiwan, which is reporting bumps in Chinese naval and air activity in surrounding waters since an election in January.

And it stretches northwest to the East China Sea and the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, called the Diaoyus by China, which Beijing claims as its sovereign territory and where it has put an almost-constant coast guard presence in the past year, according to Japan.

All those areas are potential military flashpoints between China and the US and its allies.

But Taiwan has been the major focus since elections on January 13, in which voters gave the island's ruling Democratic Progressive Party a historic third consecutive presidential victory, shrugging off warnings from China that their reelection would increase the risk of conflict.

Beijing responded soon after the vote by saying, ""Taiwan is part of China.""

Video Ad Feedback Why China's Communist Party is 'so afraid', according to fmr. Clinton official 03:19 - Source: CNN

China's ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it, and Chinese leader Xi Jinping has not ruled out the use of force to bring the island under Beijing's control.

The head of the US Indo-Pacific Command, Adm. John Aquilino, told a conference in Hawaii after the Taiwan election that he expects Beijing to show its displeasure at the result of the vote.

""The coercive pressure campaign against Taiwan continues, and we're watching it in the wake of the elections,"" Aquilino told the Pacific Forum.

""I'm not sure what they're going to do, but I expect some demonstration of force against Taiwan in the near term.""

The US admiral also noted the importance of the exercises like the US-Japan joint maneuvers taking place this week.

""Laying down the ability to be able to move forces forward, to be able to sustain the force, to be able to train and operate with our allies and partners in their home territory provides an asymmetric advantage,"" Aquilino said.","US Navy: 12 warships, including two US aircraft carriers, put on show of military might.

2024-02-01,2 generational greats on the culture of breaking,"Tony ""Mr. Wave"" Wesley and Jeffrey ""Jeffro"" Louis await breaking Olympic debut.

Tony Wesley, a pioneer known in the breakdancing -- or ""breaking"" -- community as ""Mr. Wave,"" never imagined that breaking would make it to the Olympics.

""It was unimaginable that it would go this far,"" Wesley said. ""It helped us clear our minds. It helped us gain positive thoughts and work real hard at something that we weren't used to working hard at And so for it to move all the way until the Olympics, all the way into this platform, to be recognized globally, it is a feat.""

To Wesley, breaking is a sport but it is, first and foremost, an artform.

Wesley got his start as a dancer in the '70's, watching his idol, Michael Jackson, do the robot during a performance of the Jackson 5 hit song ""Dancing Machine."" At the time, breaking was a new style of dance booming in New York City's predominantly Black and Hispanic communities.

Growing up in New York City, Wesley remembers feeling the explosion of breaking culture.

""I was in a halfway house and I saw this kid named Monroe, and he was doing the robot... brought up those old feelings of Michael Jackson,"" he said.

As a pioneer, Wesley didn't have any breaking idols. Soon, however, the sport will appear on the Olympic stage for the first time at the Paris 2024 games. Wesley sees this visibility as a growth tool for the youth, one that wasn't available when he started breaking as a teen.

Back then, Wesley moved out of the group home as a teenager and moved in with his aunt in the Bronx. He remembers feeling the culture grow even more then.

""Webster Projects was a very, very dangerous projects ... but when they played the music and they brought out their speakers, it was just calm. Everybody was drawn to the music,"" he said.

Decades later, Wesley and his crew, the New York City Breakers, have become legendary to the new generation of breakers -- many of whom are looking to snag a spot on Team USA for the upcoming Olympics.

Jeffrey ""Jeffro"" Louis, from Houston, Texas, is one of the hopeful B-boys competing to qualify for one of the spots on Team USA in the 2024 Olympic breaking competition. 16 B-Boys and 16 B-Girls from all over the world will go for the gold at the Games in August. The Olympics breaking competition sold out all sessions in under two hours.

""Olympics was never on my mind when I started breaking. I started breaking just for the love of it and the freedom of movement and just that, that freedom, that freedom to just express yourself through movement and dance and that's what got me in it. And that's what kind of kept me in it too,"" Louis said.

He teaches breaking workshops at detention centers, after school programs and offers free classes at a public park.

""These kids they really attach themselves to and they love it because it's something that you don't have to have money to do. All you need is a floor,"" Louis said.

Louis sees breaking as a sport with a lot of culture involved and believes breakers have a due diligence to understand its history. He says he himself had little knowledge of breaking's history until he was introduced to its rich past by school teachers.

""My heroes are my teachers that taught me breaking, from my middle school teacher to my high school teachers to my crewmates - everybody that I've been around. Those are my heroes,"" says Louis.

Now the 29-year-old aspiring Olympian hopes to pass on his love for the sport to the next generation.

""In breaking, we have a motto that's called each one, teach one,"" says Louis. ""So what was given to me, I'm giving back to others and hopefully they give it back to the next.""","Tony ""Mr. Wave"" Wesley is a pioneer in the breakdancing community.

2024-02-01,"Michael Strahan, athletes discuss mental health in the Black community","Often lost in the bright shine of athletic celebrity stardom are the deep human pains that can weigh on Black athletes in particular.

Only one in three Black Americans with mental health illnesses obtain treatment, according to multiple studies including research from Psychiatric Services published in the National Library of Medicine and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

""Good Morning America"" co-anchor Michael Strahan talked with a group of Black athletes about their experiences and struggles with mental health in the realm of professional competitive sports.

""I'm learning how to live a new life in this new pain-- in this journey of grief that's like a rollercoaster,"" said Jets defensive lineman Solomon Thomas, who said his mental health struggle began after his sister died by suicide in 2018.

Thomas said he grew up with the mentality that he should tough out emotional adversity.

""After my sister died, I had all these emotions and feelings I had never felt before. Like, deep depression, deep guilt,"" said Thomas.

Thomas said it wasn't until San Francisco 49ers General Manager John Lynch offered him resources for mental health that he decided to go to seek therapy.

Olympian track and field athlete Anna Cockrell said she found herself in a less traditional struggle in her third year of college.

""A lot of the typical depression symptoms that you hear about just didn't apply to me,"" said Cockrell. ""I was doing all the things you're supposed to do and still felt terrible.""

Cockrell said it was her college coach, Caryl Smith Gilbert, who recognized something was wrong and facilitated her starting therapy.

Three-time NBA All-Star Timberwolves center Karl-Anthony Towns said his mental health struggles began after his mother among several other family members died from COVID-19.

""In a way, the world was silent,"" said Towns. ""I got to a point where I had to start realizing I was deteriorating.""

Towns said it was a member of his team's medical staff whom he ultimately looked to for help.

""I felt very comfortable in having those tough conversations with someone that was familiar to me,"" said Towns.

Stigma, price of access, and shame can all act as barriers to mental health treatment and access.

Cockrell said that therapy was helpful in a time of crisis, but she found it most useful to do it consistently, so she was able to diagnose the problem. She also said she had to assuage her parents' concerns that her mental health struggle was their fault.

""I think at first, my parents, they just didn't quite understand. Like, I think there was a lot of struggle for them of thinking, ""What did we do wrong? Did we make a mistake?"" And having to reassure them,"" she said.

Strahan said he noticed the entrance of a ""new era"" of mental health that may be unfamiliar to older generations. According to a 2013 study from the American Psychological Association, only 5% of the psychology workforce was Black and Strahan noted this could be a contributing factor to lagging participation in mental health treatment.

Thomas said his mom was supportive of his therapy, something he was initially reluctant towards. He said therapy helped him answer questions like ""What does my brain patterns revert to when I get anxious or when I get sad, and how do I break that?""

Thomas said he now encourages similarly struggling teammates to seek professional help despite pushback.

""When you're stuck in that cycle, you feel so empty. You feel so alone. You feel like you're the only one going through it to a point where you even feel like you're crazy, and-- and you're not. You're human,"" said Thomas.

Towns said he thinks the biggest misconception in the Black community around mental health is the ""weakness in showing vulnerability.""

He identified the issue as a generational battle, saying the perseverance of the Black community in its fight for equal rights can make showing weakness difficult.

""We refuse to allow anything to ruin what we built,"" he said.

Cockrell said she decided to be vocal about her mental health struggle in order to speak specifically to Black women's experiences.

""You don't have to take everything on. Your pain, your experience, your voice, your struggles, your success, they all matter,"" is Cockrell's primary message to Black women.

Strahan concluded by asking the group why it's important to have these conversations about mental health in the Black community.

""There are so many people out there struggling,"" said Thomas. He said if those people could see they are not alone, ""These conversations can save these lives.""

""I look at this conversation as a celebration,"" said Strahan. ""A celebration of being free enough, confident enough, strong enough, supported enough to share how you truly feel to the world.""","Only one in three Black Americans with mental health illnesses obtain treatment.

2024-02-01,"North Carolina governor hopes Medicaid expansion, to 600K residents, can be example after yearslong battle","Both state Republicans and Democrats rallied behind the change.

More than a decade after the Affordable Care Act was passed, more than 600,000 adults in North Carolina are now eligible to receive benefits through an expansion of Medicaid that the state, like 10 others, long resisted.

The change in policy was bipartisan, since North Carolina, a perpetual battleground state, has a government divided between Democrats and Republicans.

And while North Carolina is the most recent state to adopt the Medicaid expansion that became possible under the ACA starting in 2014, it's potentially not the last: Republican officials in other holdout states like Alabama and South Carolina have signaled openness to the possibility.

""Medicaid expansion is not going anywhere. So why should we turn down the federal tax money that we've already paid in Washington? Why should we prevent North Carolinians from benefiting from that?"" the state's governor, Roy Cooper, a Democrat, told ABC News in an interview.

The expansion was signed into law in March 2023 -- with nearly two-thirds of the state House's Republicans and even more state Senate Republicans backing it -- and went into effect in December, making North Carolina the 40th state to opt into the program.

The newly qualified residents are adults from 19 to 64 years old who earn too much money to receive traditional Medicaid but generally not enough to afford public subsidies available for private health insurance.

Under the new guidelines, coverage expands to adults ages 19 through 64 who earn up to 138% of the federal poverty line, which means a single person earning about $20,000 or a family of three earning about $34,000 annually can now qualify for routine check-ups, prescription medication and other medical services without out-of-pocket expenses.

A 2022 report from the National Center for Health Statistics estimated that 17.6% of the state's 10.7 million residents were uninsured. The Medicaid expansion will cover about 5.6% of North Carolinians.

After years of debate, here's how North Carolina agreed on expanding Medicaid.

Cooper had advocated for providing more Medicaid coverage since he took office in 2017, despite facing what he called ""stiff resistance"" from Republican state leaders.

Those conservatives had long said they were not in favor of expanding Medicaid, citing concerns over government-funded insurance and the possibility that Congress could cut the financial contribution through the ACA that initially made the expansion possible. Under the ACA, the federal government pays for 90% of the cost of the expansion; individual states pay for 10%.

But if Congress one day ended the federal payments, critics said, state governments could be suddenly saddled with unworkable new bills.

Then, in 2022, the federal government offered a new financial incentive -- a nearly $1.8 billion bonus over two years to any of the remaining states who decided to expand Medicaid.

There are no restrictions on how the additional money can be spent, allowing state lawmakers to decide how it should be allocated.

Cooper told ABC News that Republican legislators in North Carolina and across the country also warmed up to the idea of expansion when they realized that the ACA, also known as ""Obamacare,"" would not be repealed.

North Carolina state Sen. Phil Berger, a leading Republican in the chamber, echoed that in a local op-ed column published in 2023.

""Since it was enacted, every attempt in Congress and by the courts to reverse the ACA and Medicaid expansion has failed,"" he wrote then. ""When Donald Trump was president and Republicans controlled Congress, they did not repeal or significantly alter the ACA. It's not going away, and refusing to accept that reality hurts North Carolinians and the state's finances.""

The ACA did not have majority approval from the public in the first years after it was passed, but that changed after 2016, according to Gallup polling.

There is still skepticism about expanding Medicaid in the remaining 10, largely Republican-led states, however.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has linked it to ""failed one-size-fit-none policies"" and Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves, who narrowly won reelection in the fall after a race that turned in part on the issue of Medicaid, has suggested he thinks it will be bad for the state's workforce if Medicaid expands and ""able-bodied Mississippians [are added] to the welfare rolls.""

Cooper said he hopes that other state leaders will see North Carolina as an example for change.

""This is the same self-examination that should occur in Texas and Florida and Alabama, and these places that need health insurance for their people,"" he told ABC News.

In Kansas, Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly is renewing her push for lawmakers to expand Medicaid to provide health care to about 150,000 low-income residents, and she has proposed adding a work requirement to the program.

North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kody Kinsley, a native of Wilmington, played a key role in advocating for Medicaid expansion in the state.

Kinsley met with leaders in the health care industry while collaborating with Republican and Democratic legislators to plan town halls on improving access to mental health resources.

He previously worked in the Obama White House during the implementation of the ACA, which was both historic -- in how it overhauled the health insurance system -- and divisive, sparking fierce criticism from Republicans. In the years since, however, public attitudes have changed and softened on the ACA, as Gallup found.

Kinsley said he made it his ""mission"" for Medicaid expansion in his home state to become a reality.

""I grew up without health insurance,"" he told ABC News. ""And so getting to today has been a personal mission for me and something I'm really proud of, to pay it forward.""

""My parents got health insurance for the first time in their lives,"" he continued. ""Right now we know we've got folks that are getting health insurance for the first time in their lives here in North Carolina.""

Through his years of advocacy work, he created alliances in unlikely places.

Kinsley, a Democrat and the state's first openly gay Cabinet member, said he spent years ""working across the aisle"" with numerous leaders in the health care industry, fellow Democrats and Republican legislators to find common ground on health-related issues.

""We've traveled all across the state,"" Kinsley said. ""We're committed to trying to find a way in areas where we do agree, charting a path forward to make a difference for the people of North Carolina.""

Kinsley built key relationships like with state Rep. Donny Lambeth, one of the primary sponsors of the bill last year that expanded Medicaid. The pair bonded over their shared commitment to improving mental health care in North Carolina.

""Secretary Kinsley has been an exceptional partner in supporting legislators in our policy work,"" Lambeth told ABC News in a statement. ""He was a valuable resource to me during my work on Medicaid Expansion. I, along with my primary bill sponsors, would seek his advice on timing of implementation particularly and details about the federal waiver process.""

""He was our link to the federal staff on key issues that we incorporated in the Bill such as the jobs training program,"" Lambeth added. ""He always made himself available to us as we needed his assistance.""

The Medicaid expansion looks set to provide a particular boost for the state's rural areas, where many residents fell in the insurance coverage gap, Kinsley said.

North Carolina has the second largest rural population in the country, according to census data. According to the state health department, the majority of adults 19 to 64 years old who are newly insured under the Medicaid expansion live in rural areas live in rural areas.

""I'm particularly happy that we're seeing a disproportionately positive impact in rural North Carolina,"" Kinsley said. ""To see some of our rural communities where people have had historic lack of access to health care be some of the biggest gainers proportionately in the number of covered folks is such an important investment in their health and in the health system in those communities.""

Rural residents like Carrie McBane say they have been making ends meet for years while navigating the challenges that can come without health insurance.

McBane, 50, lives in the small town of Sylva along the ridges of the Plott Balsam Mountains. She worked as a restaurant server for several years and said she earned too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid but not enough to afford private insurance.

""In small towns, it's a lot of restaurants and construction,"" McBane said. ""So the pay rate, the wages per hour are very low. The cost of living now is very high. It's a struggle.""

McBane said she was working long hours, at times 10-to-12-hour shifts, to support herself until she suddenly became very ill.

""I knew that something was wrong,"" she recalled. ""I had very bad dry mouth, my hair started falling out, my vision changed backward ... this just kind of hit me all at once.""

After visiting several doctors who could not identify her illness and paying for those visits out of pocket, she was ultimately diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, she said. Without insurance, she struggled to pay for insulin and other life-saving medications.

""When you're really sick, and you don't know what to do -- I can't afford it, so basically I'm robbing Peter to pay Paul,"" she said.

""I was just exhausted,"" she added. ""I just felt like nobody was listening to me.""

Her health journey inspired her to become an advocate and help spread awareness about health coverage options in her community. She said she did not qualify for traditional Medicaid because her monthly income was about $100 too high, thus placing her in the insurance coverage gap like many other families in her town.

""When you don't have health care coverage, the struggle is real and it is dire,"" she said. ""We want the recognition you know, we're not second-class citizens because we live in the mountains.""

But now, McBane says she hopes that expanded Medicaid coverage will help aid others like her who faced the same barriers to health care access, including limited resources and costly medical expenses.

""The advocacy work is getting the information out there, trying to help people understand what's required, trying to not be afraid of the system and just to give support,"" she said. ""Our next steps are they're just going to have to be fluid. It's a broken system. Winning big steps to get this work done -- it will happen.""","More than 600,000 adults in North Carolina are now eligible to receive benefits through Medicaid expansion.

2024-02-01,"As 988 centers struggle to hire, burnout plagues some crisis staff","Faced with heavy workloads and limited training, some workers are walking off.

For Belinda Mosby, the nightmares started in March.

Mosby had been working at Carelon Behavioral Health, one of the new 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline hotline centers in New Hampshire, for two months. When Mosby started the job in January 2023, she said she was enthusiastic. After 25 years working in the mental health industry as a prison behavioral health specialist, substance abuse counselor and mobile crisis responder, she knew how dire the crisis was. She also said she knew she could help.

""I'm 25 years of preparing for this,"" Mosby told ABC News of her thinking at the time.

But quickly, she said she felt overwhelmed. Callers were in such severe distress, she told ABC News. Call after call, Mosby said she began to feel a discomfort set in that she couldn't shake.

First came the anxiety, Mosby said. Then, the nightmares, followed by panic attacks. The attacks grew so severe that even imagining another call could set the chain in motion, Mosby said.

Part of Mosby liked the job, she said: the ability to help people at a critical moment in their mental health crisis. But she said part of her also worried about how the work was impacting her own health.

""Just the thought of the job -- that's how bad it was,"" Mosby said.

In July 2022, amid historic rates of mental health illness, the Biden administration launched 988 -- the new national suicide prevention hotline -- to reinvigorate the country's previous, antiquated network. Since its launch, the White House has invested nearly $1 billion into 988, and the hotline has served more than 7 million Americans, Danielle Bennett, a spokesperson for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), told ABC News.

That figure -- which is a group of people almost double the entire population of Los Angeles -- is 40% more than were served over the same period before the hotline's launch in 2022, according to SAMHSA data.

The federal government has also developed community-centered sub-networks for veterans, LGBTQ+ individuals, Spanish speakers and the hard of hearing to meet each group's distinct needs. The company Vibrant Emotional Health has the contract to administer the hotline, and the hotline is overseen by SAMHSA.

But now, some 988 workers such as Mosby -- who were already in significant shortage -- say they're burning out and leaving the job. Data obtained by ABC News found that, in some states such as Oklahoma and Colorado, more than one-third of employees left within months of taking their first call. In addition, turnover rates continue to increase across the United States. In Washington, for example, state data shows attrition rates increased 1.5 times between 2022 and 2023.

As calls to 988 balloon with ever-higher demand, and as the line continues to provide much-needed services at a pressing time, officials are expressing concern about what the burnout trends among employees mean for the hotline.

""Staff burnout is high,"" Tia Dole, the chief 988 officer at Vibrant Emotional Health, the organization appointed by the federal government to oversee the line, told ABC News.

In some cases, the job is putting workers' own mental health in jeopardy, too, Dole said. ""It is hard to answer calls all day when you're going through things yourself,"" Dole added. ""The people answering calls are people, too.""

For Chantel Aaron, operating the Carelon hotline was the culmination of her own journey of struggling with mental health challenges. Including hotlines she'd tried calling -- hotlines that provided little relief at the time, Aaron said.

""I've always been a person who, if I don't like something, I change it,"" Aaron told ABC News.

Her first day working at the hotline was in January 2023, and Aaron said she remembers it vividly. ""I got thrown in,"" she said. The first contact was a repeat caller, she said, someone who's chronically grappled with mental illness and the kind of patient the hotlines have struggled to care for.

The caller ""was very belligerent and aggressive"" and ""didn't want to hear solutions,"" Aaron said.

In the weeks and months that followed, that kind of call was not a rare occurrence, Aaron said. And as she got further into her time with the hotline, she said she also noticed a parallel, growing challenge: Her colleagues were showing up less and less. Sometimes, even at peak hours, the only staff on the line would be Aaron and a colleague, she said. Shifts originally scheduled for eight hours became 12; Aaron said she picked up more night and weekend shifts.

""It was killing my spirit,"" Aaron said.

Aaron's experience is not unique. Since the earliest days of 988's launch, centers around the country have faced major hurdles in hiring amid what the U.S. Government Accountability Office says are shortages in the behavioral health workforce.

Data obtained by ABC News from Nebraska's Department of Health and Human Services showed that in 12 of 16 months since the hotline's June 2022 rollout, there have been more vacancies than employed staff. In West Virginia, during those same six quarters, staffing has not once met the levels required by federal and state grants, according to data from the state obtained by ABC News.

There's also growing turnover among the staff that centers are, in fact, able to hire.

In Washington, 988 staff attrition rates increased from 19% in 2022 to 30% in 2023, state data shows. In Oklahoma, more than one-third of 988 staff have turned over since July 2022, according to state data. In Colorado, turnover rates of employees who'd been on the job for more than three months reached 40%, according to state data. In those working for less than three months, the rates shot up to 60%, state data shows.

Other states have been more successful in terms of hiring and retention. For example, in Oklahoma, turnover rates dropped between 2022 and 2023, state data showed. In West Virginia, head count has steadily climbed every quarter: As of September 2023, vacancies were the lowest on record, and turnover had stabilized, according to state data.

But even standouts like these states haven't been able to overcome broader headwinds facing the industry. State data shows West Virginia still has 20% less staff than required by the federal government. Oklahoma still has turnover rates that exceed 30%, according to state data.

Shortages and turnover are a major problem for the mental health workforce overall, according to a 2022 SAMHSA report. They can jeopardize care for patients and call operators alike, the report states.

""Burnout is one of the biggest workforce challenges we're facing,"" Monica Johnson, SAMHSA's 988 director, wrote to ABC News.

One major contributor to burnout in the mental health workforce, according to the 2022 SAMHSA report, is a ""feelin[g] of inefficacy."" One of the major determinants of efficacy, some 988 operators told ABC News, was whether they felt they had the tools to handle calls.

All 988 hotline workers undergo basic training developed by Vibrant, the company that administers the hotline, while more in-depth training is left up to the discretion of individual states, Vibrant's Dole said. This allows states to adopt their own standards customized to their specific constituents, she added.

Vibrant doesn't claim its training can stand on its own. ""988 Lifeline-provided training resources are intended to offer a foundation that supplements the local training that crisis centers in the network provide,"" Divendra Jaffar, a Vibrant spokesperson, told ABC News.

SAMHSA doesn't have specific guidelines for what 988 crisis hotline operator training should include. ""There is not one standard nationwide crisis center training program for contact centers in the network, and that training can and does vary across the contact centers,"" Bennett, at SAMHSA, said.

But the agency does discuss key elements for crisis care in 2020 guidance on best practice care. Some of those elements are not covered in the Vibrant training, according to Anthony Cava, a spokesperson for the California Department of Health Care Services.

For example, SAMHSA says in its guidance that crisis care staff should have training on ""trauma-informed care"" during orientation. Cava told ABC News the Vibrant modules don't include instruction on ""trauma-informed care,"" and that California added a module to cover it. The SAMHSA guidelines also say crisis care staff should be prepared to handle substance abuse issues, but the Vibrant training doesn't include modules on substance use, Cava told ABC News.

Vibrant did not comment specifically to ABC News about inconsistencies between its training and SAMHSA's recommendations.

Beyond the Vibrant training, centers ""are required to be certified by an independent accreditation authority,"" Bennett at SAMHSA said -- a process that Vibrant oversees. However, these accreditation authorities' standards can vary widely. For example, the American Association of Suicidology only requires 30 hours of training. In other cases, according to Vibrant documents, no certification or licensure is required for 988 centers ""assuming there is a demonstrable need for a center in that area."" There are seven centers that have had provisional acceptance, and these centers are expected to pursue accreditation following their admittance to the network, Jaffar added.

In New Hampshire, where Carelon Behavioral Health is located, ""staff training varies depending on the role the provider fills and their level of education,"" Jennifer O'Higgins, a senior policy analyst for the state's Department of Health and Human Services, told ABC News. The state didn't provide any other details on its training requirements or whether they added modules on top of the Vibrant training.

Soon after Clara Rodriguez started taking calls for Carelon in June 2023, Rodriguez said she started doubting whether she was prepared to handle the workload.

Rodriguez said she was taking calls with people who ran the gamut of mental illness: adults and children, all with diverse gender, racial and ethnic backgrounds. People who were struggling with hallucinations and delusions, Rodriguez said; people who were actively suicidal or homicidal.

It didn't take long before Rodriguez said she felt overwhelmed. Rodriguez had no behavioral health experience before joining the line and said she only received two weeks of training, mostly via 45-minute online modules, before starting at the hotline. According to Johnson at SAMHSA, there are no strict credentialing requirements for call operators, so long as these operators receive high-quality training during their onboarding process.

But Rodriguez said she felt these didn't meet what she would consider a high-quality standard.

""Those [were] intro courses, like me reading something online,"" she said. ""I found myself undertrained.""

""We take the training, supervision and support of our staff seriously,"" Tina Gaines, a Carelon spokesperson, wrote to ABC News in response to the allegations of Rodriguez and others.

The feeling of being undertrained weighed heavily on Rodriguez, she said. ""Answering a call where someone says they're tired and had a bad day is very different from answering a call with someone who says they have a gun to their head,"" she said, ""I don't have the experience to de-escalate a situation like that.""

Although not specifically addressing Carelon, Vibrant acknowledged the impact a lack of training might have on 988 centers.

""If there is a lack of training, there is absolutely a possibility of organizational disintegration,"" David Obergfell, Vibrant's assistant vice president of 988 center engagement, told ABC News.

Rodriguez said the limited training and long hours weighed on her. Even after months on the line, she said questioned her abilities. ""Am I capable,"" Rodriguez said she would ask herself. ""Am I competent?""

According to the 2022 SAMHSA report, a ""sense of failure"" is also commonly associated with burnout. For Rodriguez, at a certain point, she said these concerns became personal.

""I [started] feeling like if my parents called, or if someone else I loved called, I would be highly upset if I found out someone answering on the end of the call has not been trained properly to do the job,"" Rodriguez said.

For Mosby, Rodriguez and Aaron, their feelings of inadequate training combined with the pressures of the job gradually caught up.

Rodriguez, like Mosby, said she's been fighting overwhelming anxiety, panic attacks and nightmares. Aaron said she also, at times, has had a difficult time coping with situations that are deeply triggering.

According to SAMHSA, burnout has close and potentially long-lasting ties to one's one well-being.

""Helping people in crisis can take a toll,"" SAMHSA's Johnson wrote to ABC News. ""In many cases, [988 operators are] talking to people on the worst days of their lives.""

Rodriguez said she eventually mustered the courage, for her sake, to air these challenges to a supervisor. She's been struggling, she told them, as have her colleagues, and she thought that was a reason some were choosing to leave.

But, in contrast to SAMHSA's 2020 guidance, Rodriguez said her supervisor responded by saying that ""some people just weren't meant for the job.""

""[We] consistently uphold the standards and training at our call centers,"" Gaines, at Carelon, wrote to ABC News.

In January, Vibrant and Carelon parted ways after failing to agree on the terms of contract renewal. Carelon continues to provide services to a handful of state partners.

""Vibrant Emotional Health is well-equipped to manage natural evolution within the 988 Lifeline network,"" Jaffar, at Vibrant, wrote to ABC News.

Experienced altogether, the challenges faced by hotline workers have forced a reckoning among people such as Mosby, Rodriguez and Aaron.

Mosby left the job in September. She said she doesn't know if, or when, she'll reenter behavioral health work.

Given how much working the line has impacted her own well-being, Rodriguez said she also struggled. In October, Rodriguez said she'd ideally like to find another job sooner rather than later.

""If I could leave tomorrow,"" she said at the time, ""I would."" Rodriguez recently told ABC News she left her job by early January.

Still, 988 continues to fill a critical void in providing mental health services, she said. Over and over, Rodriguez said she's witnessed firsthand how much the line can help people. Rodriguez said she also continues to encourage people to call 988, especially given how few other options may be available for so many.

""They're calling a line for hope,"" Rodriguez said.","Some 988 workers say they're burning out and leaving the job.

2024-02-01,Heart health month: What we know about lipoprotein (a),"For decades, doctors have encouraged patients to monitor their cholesterol levels, with studies showing that heart disease risk increases with high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), also known as the ""bad cholesterol,"" and not enough high-density lipoprotein (HDL), also known as the ""good cholesterol.""

Diet, exercise, and medications like statins can help people regulate their good and bad cholesterol levels.

But now, doctors are recognizing the importance of a third type of cholesterol -- lipoprotein (a).

Lipoprotein (a) has been increasingly recognized as a standalone predictor for cardiovascular disease due to its inflammatory properties that accelerate clot formation in the blood vessels.

Scientists are still learning more about lipoprotein (a). Testing is available but not universally recommended. For now, drugs to treat high levels are not available, but may soon be on the horizon.

But, for anyone whose parents, grandparents, or relatives have developed heart disease at a young age, doctors say it's important for everyday people to ask their doctors about lipoprotein (a), which may be a culprit.

""Anyone who has a strong family history of heart disease or has had evidence of heart disease that is premature -- that is, before the age of 55 in men and before 65 years of age in women -- should consider lipoprotein (a) testing,"" Chair in Preventative Cardiology and Professor of Medicine at Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans, Louisiana, Dr. Keith Ferdinand, says. ""[It] may be a good way to predict if you are at increased risk beyond the conventional lipid panel.""

Lipoprotein (a) testing can also be measured in those whose cholesterol levels do not improve with standard cholesterol-lowering medications, says Associate Professor of Medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Dr. Stephen Juraschek.

The American Heart Association supports once-in-a-lifetime measurement of lipoprotein (a) in people at risk for cardiovascular disease, differing from practice guidelines across Europe and Canada, which recommend measuring lipoprotein (a) at least once in all adults.

As a result, some insurance plans do not cover lipoprotein (a) testing. Be sure to talk to your doctor about whether lipoprotein (a) testing is appropriate for you.

""Unfortunately, there is no treatment available,"" says Ferdinand.

But doctors say knowledge is power -- and people with high levels can take other steps to lower their heart disease risk.

For example, efforts should be made to lower LDL to a target level with cholesterol-lowering medications, according to Juraschek. People should also focus on improving ""blood pressure, avoidance of smoking, weight loss, physical activity and control of blood glucose levels,"" says Ferdinand.

""There are studies now looking at two different medications that specifically target one of the proteins involved in production of lipoprotein (a), and we probably won't have the results of those clinical trials for another 2-3 more years,"" says Professor of Cardiology and Director of the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in Baltimore, Maryland, Dr. Roger Blumenthal.

There are eight ongoing clinical trials investigating novel drugs that directly target how lipoprotein (a) is made on a molecular level. All but one of the ongoing trials are using an injectable form of these novel drugs that are administered subcutaneously, or underneath the skin. ""Some of the most advanced of these therapies are in stage 3 trials, which will be needed prior to FDA approval,"" says Juraschek.

""Although lipoprotein (a) cannot be lowered through lifestyle modifications, this does not dismiss the importance of building healthy habits,"" says Associate Professor of Cardiology and Director of the Preventive Cardiovascular Health Program, Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, Dr. Erica Spatz. ""Committing to a regular exercise routine and eating a more plant-forward diet can significantly reduce total cardiovascular risk, which is even more important if lipoprotein (a) is elevated.""","Doctors are recognizing the importance of a third type of cholesterol -- lipoprotein (a) Testing is available but not universally recommended.

2024-02-01,"US hits Houthi UAVs, ground control station in Yemen","They presented an ""imminent threat to merchant vessels and the U.S. Navy.""

U.S. military forces early Thursday morning conducted what Central Command called a ""self-defense"" strike against Houthi unmanned aerial vehicles and a ground control station.

According to Centcom, the U.S. had identified a UAV ground control station and a number of UAVs in the Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. The military ""determined that they presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and the U.S. Navy ships in the region.""

As a result, Centcom said, U.S. forces hit the UAV station, destroying it. Ten one-way UAVs were struck in self-defense, it said.

""This action will protect freedom of navigation and make international waters safer and more secure for U.S. Navy vessels and merchant vessels,"" Centcom said in announcing the news.

As part of efforts to stop Iran-backed Houthi militants from attacking vital Middle Eastern shipping lanes, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced earlier this month that the U.S. would once again classify the Yemeni rebel group as a terrorist organization. The State Department says the step will enable the U.S. to more effectively restrict the group's access to financial support.

Blinken said that the restrictions and penalties linked to the designation would not take effect for 30 days and that the delay was designed to ensure the flow of aid and commercial goods to Yemeni civilians is minimally impacted.

There have been more than 150 rocket and drone attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria since mid-October carried out by Iranian-backed militias claiming they are in support of Palestinians in the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza.","U.

2024-02-01,"Out of options, Rohingya are fleeing Myanmar and Bangladesh by boat despite soaring death toll","The United Nations' refugee agency is reporting that one in every eight Rohingya who attempted to flee their homeland of Myanmar and the refugee camps in neighboring Bangladesh by boat last year died or went missing

SYDNEY -- Across a treacherous stretch of water, the Rohingya came by the thousands, then died by the hundreds. And though they know the dangers of fleeing by boat, many among this persecuted people say they will not stop -- because the world has left them with no other choice.

Last year, nearly 4,500 Rohingya -- two-thirds of them women and children -- fled their homeland of Myanmar and the refugee camps in neighboring Bangladesh by boat, the United Nations' refugee agency reported. Of those, 569 died or went missing while crossing the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea, the highest death toll since 2014.

The numbers mean one out of every eight Rohingya who attempted the crossing never made it, the UNHCR said last week.

Yet despite the risks, there are no signs the stream of Rohingya is ebbing. On Thursday, Indonesian officials said another boat carrying Rohingya refugees landed in the country's northern province of Aceh.

Fishermen provided food and water to 131 Rohingya, mostly women and children, who had been on board, said Marzuki, the leader of the local tribal fishing community, who like many Indonesians goes by one name.

Some passengers told officials they had been at sea since last month and their boat's engine had broken down, leaving them adrift, said Lt. Col. Andi Susanto, commander of the navy base in Lhokseumawe.

""Southeast Asian waters are one of the deadliest stretches in the world and a graveyard for many Rohingya who have lost their lives,"" says Babar Baloch, UNHCR's spokesman for Asia and the Pacific. ""The rate of Rohingya who are dying at sea without being rescued -- that's really alarming and worrying.""

Inside the squalid refugee camps in Bangladesh, where more than 750,000 ethnic Rohingya Muslims fled in 2017 following sweeping attacks by Myanmar's military, the situation has grown increasingly desperate. Not even the threat of death at sea is enough to stop many from trying to traverse the region's waters in a bid to reach Indonesia or Malaysia.

""We need to choose the risky journey by boat because the international community has failed their responsibility,"" says Mohammed Ayub, who is saving up money for a spot on one of the rickety wooden fishing boats traffickers use to ferry passengers 1,800 kilometers (1,100 miles) from Bangladesh to Indonesia.

Global indifference toward the Rohingya crisis has left those languishing in the overcrowded camps with few alternatives to fleeing. Because Bangladesh bans the Rohingya from working, their survival is dependent upon food rations, which were slashed last year due to a drop in global donations.

Returning safely to Myanmar is virtually impossible for the Rohingya, because the military that attacked them overthrew Myanmar's democratically elected government in 2021. And no country is offering the Rohingya any large-scale resettlement opportunities.

Meanwhile, a surge in killings, kidnappings and arson attacks by militant groups in the camps has left residents fearing for their lives. And so, starving, scared and out of options, they continue to board the boats.

Ayub has lived in a sweltering, cramped shelter for more than six years in a camp where security and sanitation are scarce, and hope even scarcer. There is no formal schooling for his children, no way for him to earn money, no prospects for returning to his homeland and no refuge for his family amid spiraling gang violence.

""Of course I understand how dangerous the boat journey by sea is,"" Ayub says. ""We could die during the journey by boat. But it depends on our fate. ... It's better to choose the dangerous way even if it's risky, because we are afraid to stay in the camps.""

Two hundred of the people who died or went missing at sea last year were aboard one boat that left Bangladesh in November. Eyewitnesses on a nearby boat told The Associated Press that the missing vessel, which was crowded with babies, children and mothers, broke down and was taking on water before it drifted off during a storm as its passengers screamed for help. It has not been seen since.

It was one of several distressed boats that the region's coastal countries neglected to save, despite the UNHCR's requests for those countries to launch search and rescue missions.

""When no action is taken, lives are lost,"" says UNHCR's Baloch. ""If there is no hope restored in Rohingya lives either in Myanmar or in Bangladesh, there are no rescue attempts, (then) sadly we could see more desperate people dying in Southeast Asian seas under the watch of coastal authorities who could act to save lives.""

Six of Mohammed Taher's family members were aboard the boat that vanished in November, including his 15-year-old brother, Mohammed Amin, and two of Taher's nephews, aged 3 and 4. Their ultimate destination was Malaysia, a Muslim-majority country where many Rohingya seek relative safety.

Taher and his parents now struggle to sleep or eat, and spend their days agonizing over what became of their loved ones. Taher's mother saw a fortune teller who said her relatives were still alive. Taher, meanwhile, dreamed that the boat made it to shore, where his relatives took refuge in a school and were able to bathe in warm water. But he remains unconvinced their journey ended so happily.

And so he has vowed to tell everyone to stay off the boats, no matter how unbearable life on land has become.

""I will never leave by boat on this difficult journey,"" Taher says. ""All the people who reached their destination are saying that it's horrific traveling by boat.""

Yet such warnings are often futile. Ayub is now preparing to sell his daughter's jewelry to help pay for his spot on a boat. While he is frightened by the stories of those who didn't make it, he is motivated by the stories of those who did.

""Nobody would consider taking a risk by boat on a dangerous journey if they had better opportunities,"" he says. ""Fortunately, some people did reach their destination and got a better life. I am staying positive that Allah will save us.""

2024-02-01,Winnett to start for Wales in Six Nations after just 15 games of professional rugby,"CARDIFF, Wales (AP) -- After just 15 games of professional rugby, Cameron Winnett is in line to make his debut for Wales in the Six Nations.

The 21-year-old Winnett, who plays for Cardiff, was picked at fullback for Wales' opening match of the tournament at home to Scotland on Saturday.

""Cameron Winnett is just a lovely footballer and I think he is going to develop into a quality international player in the future,"" Wales coach Warren Gatland said Thursday. ""He is young and there will be no pressure on him.""

Wales' options at fullback have reduced after Liam Williams' move to Japan, the retirement of Leigh Halfpenny and the decision of Louis Rees-Zammit -- a winger who can play at No. 15 -- to quit rugby and pursue a career in American football.

George North has been ruled out of the game because of a shoulder injury, leaving Owen Watkin and Nick Tompkins to forge Wales' midfield partnership.

Flanker James Botham, the grandson of England cricket great Ian Botham, was recalled for a first Wales appearance since July 2021.

Lock Will Rowlands, whose partner recently gave birth, was not included in the matchday 23, with captain Dafydd Jenkins and Adam Beard forming the second row.

At 21, Jenkins is Wales' youngest captain since Gareth Edwards, then 20, led Wales against Scotland in 1968.

Gatland said the roof at the Millennium Stadium will be open for the match following a request from Scotland.

""Scotland want the roof open, which I think is a little bit disappointing from an atmosphere point of view because when that roof is shut it does tend to create a lot more atmosphere and noise in the stadium,"" he said. ""But that is the decision that they made.""

2024-02-01,Reports: F1 great Lewis Hamilton linked with shock move from Mercedes to Ferrari in 2025,"Seven-time Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton has been linked with a shock move from Mercedes to Ferrari next year, according to reports on Thursday.

Sky Sports News said Hamilton would leave Mercedes after the 2024 season and replace Carlos Sainz Jr. at Ferrari. It didn't cite any sources. The Daily Mail also said the deal would go through while motorsport.com said it wasn't a done deal yet but negotiations were at an advanced stage and could be concluded this week.

When contacted by The Associated Press, Mercedes and Ferrari declined to comment on if Hamilton will join Ferrari.

The move would surprise many F1 observers because the 39-year-old British driver signed a new two-year deal last summer until 2025, although it remains unclear whether the deal contained an escape clause.

Hamilton won six titles with Mercedes in seven years from 2014-20 and lost the 2021 championship to Red Bull's Max Verstappen on the final lap of the last race. He has not won a race since 2021 and remains stuck on a record 103 wins.

If he joins Ferrari he would likely replace Sainz, considering Sainz's teammate, Charles Leclerc, recently signed a multi-year contract extension.

Hamilton joined Mercedes in 2013 from McLaren in what was also a surprise move at the time.

After dominating to 2020, Hamilton and Mercedes have been frustrated in the past two seasons. Mercedes won only one race in 2022 when the car suffered from a bouncing effect, known in F1 as porpoising. The team admitted getting the design wrong.

2024-02-01,"Trump-era tax cuts poised to expire soon, meaning you could face steeper taxes","Fox Business host Larry Kudlow breaks down tax and economic policy on 'Kudlow.'

Millions of Americans could soon face steeper tax bills when massive components of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expire at the end of 2025.

Enacted by former President Trump in 2017, the law drastically overhauled the nation's tax code, including reducing the top individual income tax bracket to 37% from 39.6% and nearly doubling the size of the standard deduction.

However, those changes to the individual section of the tax code are poised to sunset in 2025, meaning that many taxpayers will face steeper levies if the law is not extended.

""If lawmakers allow full expiration to occur, most Americans will see their personal tax bills rise and incentives for working and investing worsen,"" said Erica York, senior economist and research director at the Tax Foundation.

In addition to lowering the top tax bracket for wealthy Americans, the Trump-era law raised the thresholds for several income tax brackets - essentially lowering the liability for many households.

SOCIAL SECURITY RECIPIENTS COULD BE HIT WITH A SURPRISE TAX BILL THIS YEAR

The individual income tax brackets in 2017, before Trump's tax law took effect.

REMOTE WORKERS FACE A DOUBLE TAXATION THREAT

The individual income tax brackets in 2024, under current tax law.

The expiration of the tax law on Dec. 31, 2025 will essentially mean that many Americans will be forced to pay anywhere between 1% to 4% more in taxes unless certain provisions are extended or made permanent.

The topic is likely to be a source of contention during the general election. Trump has pledged to make the tax cuts permanent if he is re-elected in November. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has also suggested that President Biden would seek to retain the tax reductions for Americans earning less than $400,000 during a second term in the White House.

The problem, however, is that the Congressional Budget Office estimates extending the TCJA would add roughly $3.7 trillion to the federal budget deficit.

The original law was partially paid for by the so-called SALT deduction cap, which limits the amount of state and local taxes that Americans can deduct from their federal taxes to $10,000. That cap is also poised to end in 2025.

However, the SALT cap as a revenue generator has lost some potency since 2017, thanks to fresh workarounds.

""Though lawmakers may not address the looming expirations this year, they should prepare for the upcoming expiration by weighing the trade-offs of each change the 2017 tax law made,"" York said. ""Lawmakers should cement into law a tax code that promotes growth and opportunity without worsening U.S. debt.""","Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is set to expire at the end of 2025.

2024-02-01,Tesla to Texas? Elon Musk announces major shareholder vote,"Nicholas Wealth Management President and founder reveals which Big Tech stocks are set to explode on 'Varney & Co.'

Tesla will hold a shareholder vote to transfer its state of incorporation to Texas, CEO Elon Musk announced after a Delaware judge voided his $56 billion pay package.

On Tuesday, Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick sided with Tesla investors who had challenged the 2018 share-based pay package, ruling that the ""unfathomable sum"" was unfair to shareholders and negotiated by directors who appeared beholden to Musk.

""Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware,"" Musk posted on X, formerly Twitter, after the ruling came down.

In a follow-up post on X, Musk polled the platform's users, asking, ""Should Tesla change its state of incorporation to Texas, home of its physical headquarters?"" The results of the poll were 87.1% ""Yes"" and 12.9% ""No"" after more than 1.1 million users voted.

ELON MUSK'S $56 BILLION PAY PACKAGE VOIDED BY JUDGE

""The public vote is unequivocally in favor of Texas!"" Musk declared early Thursday. ""Tesla will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation to Texas.""

Texas is currently the home of Tesla's corporate headquarters.

Musk moved the company from Palo Alto, California, to Austin, Texas in 2021 in protest of California's heavy regulations and high taxes. He had also clashed with the state's health officials during the COVID-19 pandemic over reopening a factory in Fremont.

TESLA STOCK DIVES AFTER EARNINGS, WARNS OF 'SLOWER GROWTH'

The Lone Star State is also host to one of the EV maker's gigafactories, which is currently planning a $750 million expansion. Musk has additional plans to build a lithium refinery in the state, which he has said will produce lithium for ""about a million vehicles"" and have more lithium refining capacity than ""the rest of North American refining capacity combined.""

Musk's other companies, like SpaceX and The Boring Company, also have operations in Texas.

More than 65 percent of all Fortune 500 companies and more than half of all U.S. publicly traded companies are incorporated in the state of Delaware, drawn to the state by its business-friendly corporate laws and tax benefits, according to Harvard Business Services, a firm offering Delaware business formation services.

But Musk has faced several challenges in the First State.

McCormick was the same judge who presided over Twitter's July 2022 lawsuit against Musk after he tried to cancel his $44 billion deal to buy the social media platform. The judge rejected his attempts to delay the deal, and it was ultimately finalized and now re-branded as X.

""I recommend incorporating in Nevada or Texas if you prefer shareholders to decide matters,"" Musk said in another post on X after McCormick's ruling on his pay package.

Tesla shares were up nearly 2% in pre-market trading Thursday.

2024-02-01,Weight loss medication shortage creates market for bogus drugs,"Beachbody co-founder and CEO Carl Daikeler explains how the popularity of weight loss drugs is impacting online fitness subscriptions on 'The Claman Countdown.'

Counterfeit versions of weight-loss related medications are ""detrimental to the field of obesity medicine"" and can pose severe risks to patient health, particularly to those who rely on them most, according to medical experts.

There is growing concern that the shortage of these popular weight-loss related drugs has created a market for suspected counterfeits.

The World Health Organization (WHO) warned Monday that global shortages of drugs that are indicated to manage type 2 diabetes and, in some cases, approved for weight loss, also known as glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1-RA) products, ""have been associated with an increase in reports of falsified GLP-1-RA"" over the past year.

Drugs that fall under this category include Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Ozempic.

On Wednesday, Novo said that it is steadily increasing its capacity to produce more of its weight-loss drug Wegovy than ever before. However, the company still cautioned that ""overall demand will continue to exceed supply, which means that some patients may still have difficulty filling Wegovy prescriptions.""

For Ozempic, all doses are currently available as indicated on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Drug Shortage website, though the company noted that it ""cannot control which specific pharmacies or patients receive Ozempic.""

""We continue to build and invest in new manufacturing capacity,"" Novo said. In 2024, it plans to invest approximately $6.5 billion in production, compared to investments of approximately $3.6 billion last year.

NOVO NORDISK'S WEGOVY REDUCES RISK OF SERIOUS HEART PROBLEMS BY 20%, STUDY SHOWS

Representatives for Eli Lilly have not responded to FOX Business' request for comment.

""Shortages adversely impact access to medical products and create a vacuum which is often filled by falsified versions,"" according to WHO, which noted that these shortages are ""likely to have disproportionate consequences"" on diabetes type II patients.""

These fake versions are often sold through unregulated channels like social media platforms, the agency said.

Counterfeit versions of the drugs semaglutide and tirzepatide, which are sold under the brand names Wegovy, Ozempic, Mounjaro and Zepbound ""are detrimental to the field of obesity medicine overall,"" Dr. Daniel Maselli, an endobariatric physician and research associate director of True You Weight Loss in Atlanta, told FOX Business.

""The emergence of counterfeit agents doesn't just pollute the chemical makeup of these medications, it also pollutes the public's ability to trust anti-obesity medications period,"" Maselli said. ""At that point, a healthy skepticism of a novel medication becomes an outright distrust, which puts up even more barriers for patients with obesity to have access to safe and effective treatments.""

DIABETES DRUG TESTED FOR WEIGHT LOSS COULD BE GAME CHANGER

While this can result in great mistrust in novel medications, Dr. Jamie Mullally, an endocrinologist at Westchester Medical Center Health Network in Westchester County, New York, stressed that there are other concerns.

For one, these fake versions are compounded medications, which are not regulated by federal health officials.

""I think the main issue is a lack of regulation by the FDA,"" Mullally said. ""We don't know if they're effective or if they are safe.""

Companies such as Novo and Eli Lilly, which manufactures Mounjaro and Zepbound, ""go through years and years of safety trials and effectiveness trials and these compounding versions of medicine are inherently different.""

""You just don't know what's in there because nobody's regulating them,"" Mullally, who has a specialty in obesity medicine, added.

PATIENTS STOP WEGOVY, OTHER WEIGHT LOSS-RELATED DRUGS SHORTLY AFTER STARTING, DOCTORS SAY

The FDA has issued warnings about compounded drug products containing semaglutide or semaglutide salts.

In an October 2023 letter to the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, the FDA stressed that ""compounded drugs, including compounded semaglutide drug products, are not FDA-approved and do not receive premarketing review for safety, efficacy, and quality.""

Just weeks after that letter was issued, Novo even announced it was taking legal action against certain pharmacies for allegedly selling drugs claiming to contain semgaglutide that are not approved by the FDA.

Jason Brett, executive director of Medical Affairs at Novo Nordisk Inc. said that several tests of the compounded drugs that claimed to contain semaglutide showed ""concerning levels of unknown impurities."" One sample in particular had a concerning level of 33%, which may pose potential safety risks to patients, according to Novo.

GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE

With weight-loss drugs in general, Mullally noted that doctors have been worried about cardiac side effects.

With these fake versions, there are even more concerns regarding whether the drug is even sterile.

""There may be mishandling of the drug itself that could lead to an infection,"" she said.

If the dose is too high, that is also a worry because it can cause symptoms ranging from severe nausea, vomiting to pancreatitis, she said, though she noted that's just speculation, given that she isn't aware of the drugs that are being mixed together.

Similarly, WHO also stressed concerns that these false medications can ""cause toxic reactions.""

""They are neither approved nor controlled by competent authorities and may have been produced in unhygienic conditions by unqualified personnel, contain unknow impurities and can be contaminated with bacteria,"" WHO said.","Counterfeit versions of weight-loss related drugs are ""detrimental to the field of obesity medicine,"" experts say.

2024-02-01,Biden angers fossil fuel proponents with 'devastating' move to halt natural gas projects,"Former Energy Secretary Rick Perry discusses Biden pausing LNG exports and the ongoing border crisis.

Fossil fuel proponents are sounding the alarm over the White House's decision to halt proposed liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, warning the move inflicts a damaging blow to the U.S. economy and national security.

The White House and Department of Energy (DOE) jointly announced Friday that the pause would occur while federal officials conduct a rigorous environmental review assessing the projects' carbon emissions, which could take more than a year to complete.

""The decision by President Biden and those within his administration will have ripple effects on energy investments and throughout the entire American economy, impacting jobs, manufacturing, and industrial restoring,"" Interstate Natural Gas Association of America (INGAA) President Amy Andryszak told Fox News Digital following the announcement.

""A key part of President Biden's industrial policy included promises to create jobs and expand industrial manufacturing, and this decision will make that goal more difficult.""

BUSINESS GROUPS FROM US, EUROPE AND JAPAN PUSH BACK ON BIDEN LNG PERMIT PAUSE

In a Fox News Digital op-ed published Wednesday, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who led the Department of Energy under President Trump, argued pausing LNG export projects will ""devastate"" the industry and ""thousands of Americans employed by the sector.""

""Unfortunately, the Biden administration refuses to acknowledge the importance of strong domestic energy production to U.S. national security and is playing into our adversaries' hands by prioritizing appeasement of environmentalist groups - even those backed by China - over the long-term strength and security of our nation,"" Perry wrote.

""It's imperative to reverse these actions and return to the path of energy independence. Our focus must shift towards domestic oil and gas production, characterized by the world's strictest environmental standards, to bolster energy security, support the American workforce, and stimulate economic growth.""

Perry previously said on ""Mornings With Maria"" that the pause was ""wrong in so many different ways,"" and makes him question who's ""really running the White House today.""

In a statement Friday, the president said the pause on LNG permitting was a part of his sweeping climate agenda, saying the action ""sees the climate crisis for what it is: the existential threat of our time.""

Prior to the announcement, Andryszak defended the natural gas industry as ""absolutely essential"" to lowering emissions, arguing it should be ""part of any clean energy future solution.""

""There have been 582 million metric tons of CO2 reductions since 2005, and that was directly attributed to more natural gas being used for electric generation,"" she told Fox News Digital in December, citing a recent U.S. Energy Information Administration report. ""I don't think that the Biden administration is giving our industry enough credit for that.""

""It's an on-demand energy source. And if you are building out a system that's heavily reliant on renewables, those are intermittent energy sources. Sometimes the wind doesn't blow, the sun doesn't shine, and you're going to need backup for that. And that's what both coal and natural gas have provided. And you need to continue to have [it] as backup as more renewable sources come on the electric grid,"" she continued.","Fossil fuel proponents are sounding the alarm over the White House's decision to halt LNG projects.

2024-02-01,The Taylor Swift effect: pop star boosts interest in the Big Game among these generations,"San Francisco 49ers President Al Guido weighs in on the success of third-string quarterback Brock Purdy and Taylor Swift's impact on the NFL.

Some consumers in the U.S. have felt the ""Taylor Swift effect"" when it comes to football and the upcoming Super Bowl.

LendingTree reported Monday that 13% of American consumers said their interest in watching the sport or its championship game has grown because of Swift.

Her influence was more apparent in Generation Z and Millennials. About 24% of Gen Z said the pop star boosted their interest in tuning in, while she affected a fifth of Millennials, LendingTree found in a Jan. 2-8 survey involving 2,000 U.S. adult consumers.

Slightly under two-thirds of all American consumers said the ""Cruel Summer"" singer did not affect their interest, while 23% expressed she had a negative impact on them wanting to watch, the survey said.

When watching the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers face off in the Big Game, 18% of consumers told LendingTree they would follow Swift's lead and throw their support behind the Chiefs. Her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, plays tight end for Kansas City.

Swift told Time magazine in December she has gone to games just ""to support Travis.""

For some consumers, the ""Taylor Swift effect"" also applied to spending on things related to football, whether that was jerseys, streaming services or other items, LendingTree said.

BUDWEISER'S CLYDESDALES RETURN FOR SUPER BOWL LVIII

About 16% of U.S. adults said Swift factored into them dropping money on football, with the share more than double that for those between the ages of 18 and 27.

Meanwhile, the survey found Super Bowl watchers will splash out an average of $116 for the upcoming game.

Food and drinks often go hand-in-hand with watching the Super Bowl at home or at someone else's house. That's why 73% of consumers with plans to catch the game on TV will spend money on that alone.

SUPER BOWL FLIGHTS ADDED WITH TAYLOR SWIFT, TRAVIS KELCE-THEMED NUMBERS

The LendingTree survey comes after other reports have previously brought attention to how Swift has impacted the NFL.

2024-02-01,"Majority of Americans would take a pay cut for a better work-life balance, survey finds","Ramsey Solutions founder Dave Ramsey discusses needing a sense of 'hope' to make impactful changes in personal finance habits.

Workers across the globe are starting to reassess what's more personally important to them: an improved work-life balance or taking home more pay.

According to a recent survey from U.S. automaker Ford, 52% of polled employees worldwide said they'd take a 20% pay cut to achieve a lifestyle that prioritizes their quality of life. The percentage of Americans who feel the same isn't too far off, at 51%.

And while Ford noted those polled say they still feel connected to their professional roles, they acknowledge a stressful job may be worth leaving behind. Seventy-nine percent of U.S. baby boomers, 72% of Gen X, 63% of millennials and 66% of Gen Z agree it's not worth working a job that increases stress levels.

Ramsey Solutions personality and career expert Ken Coleman previously told FOX News Digital that America's job culture is changing, mostly thanks to trends brought on by the youngest of employees.

U.S. JOB OPENINGS RISE IN DECEMBER TO HIGHEST LEVEL IN 3 MONTHS

""I think this will be the generation that ushers in the four-day workweek. I think this is the generation that will mark a truly hybrid reality,"" Coleman said.

""Older generations, please follow my lead on this,"" the career expert added, ""because you're going to have to lead these young people, and they're rock stars in this generation. They're coming to the workplace with a whole different lens on society and life in general, and you have to deal with that. Don't gripe about it.""

And receiving less pay may mean working for longer - in 2023, more American retirees have returned to full or part-time work, about 20% year-over-year, according to AARP. Coleman predicted that this number may increase.

""I recently read some data that hiring managers are less willing to hire a member from the Gen Z generation, and they're more likely to hire someone in their 60s,"" the career expert pointed out. ""And the reason for that is because they feel like they're going to get somebody with a good work ethic who is there because they need to be there, and thus they want to be there.""

""Then, the added bonus of good locker room influence,"" he continued, ""A positive influence for the younger players because of the work ethic and the experience wisdom they bring. And I think you're going to see this in corporate America.""

SHOULD BUSINESSES DISCLOSE THEIR USE OF AI? MOST AMERICANS SAY YES

Looking ahead to the future, many workers (60% globally) see artificial intelligence (A.I.) as a positive influence on work-life balance. The Ford survey found that 69% of worldwide millennials and Gen Z workers will trust A.I. to provide career advice in the next five years.

""The most prescient opportunity in 2024 is A.I. and A.I. tools,"" LinkedIn's Andrew McCaskill also told FOX News Digital. ""I think that there's so many more people who are looking for A.I. skills and looking to see workers be able to not be afraid of A.I. tools, and to actually lean into them.""

""And you can do that right now and get so far ahead of the game, even today, from the comfort of your own home,"" McCaskill added. ""And I think that that's where the future is going.""

Echoing some of the survey's sentiments, Coleman expanded on the importance of choosing a job not solely based on its impact on your wallet.

""You can control your effort. You can control your attitude. You can control the type of contribution that you want to make in the world. And yet, you can't control the economy. You can't control layoffs. You can't control maybe having a really bad leader or bad manager,"" the Ramsey personality listed.

""My advice in 2024 is: head down as you are focused on getting better,"" Coleman said. ""Don't just work to get a paycheck. Work on yourself as much as you work on your job.

2024-02-01,Ford unveils redesigned 2025 Explorer featuring new digital experience,"The Floor Show panelists Gabriela Santos and Andy Brenner react to the Federal Reserve leaving rates unchanged on The Claman Countdown.

Ford Motor Company unveiled the new 2025 Ford Explorer on Thursday, which will be the first vehicle to feature the Ford Digital Experience which is designed to increase connectivity for customers.

""From the beginning, the Explorer is this distinctly American product,"" Ford general manager of family vehicles Jeff Marentic told FOX Business. ""It's America's all-time best-selling SUV with more than 8 million units sold and close to 3.5 million still in operation, which is a big statement.""

He explained that the redesigned 2025 Ford Explorer standardizes a number of features in the 2025 Explorer's four series that were previously optional but were very popular with customers. The new Explorer offers tools for customers going on vacations, towing a camper or boat, driving off-road and looking to stay connected using the new digital experience.

""What we've done is we've designed this thing and engineered this thing and we've provided an Explorer for every customer,"" Marentic said. ""We're seeing this growing number of Millenial and Gen Z parents, so as they get into the family life stage, enter this segment. They choose the Explorer based on their needs - their desire for the ability to travel, technology plays a really big role, all the connectivity and features that are provided.""

FORD CELEBRATES HISTORIC MILESTONE FOR F-SERIES TRUCKS

Marentic said that the interior redesign included the materials, colors, surfaces and digital displays, as well as wireless chargers - with customizable displays as a key feature.

""We have a little over 12-inch digital instrument cluster and a 13-inch center stack so the display just in between the two seats, so you have almost two feet of screens and it just provides this really easy view of information and anything that we do relative to connectivity,"" Marentic said.

Both the 13-inch touchscreen and the digital cluster can display navigation screens that are integrated with Google Maps.

The Ford Digital Experience prioritizes the use of voice with Google Assistant serving as the default voice assistant and Amazon's Alexa Built-In is available as an alternative for in-vehicle controls like temperature, search information, getting directions and tuning the radio. It can also help to make calls, send texts, schedule meetings and control connected home devices.

When parked, the new Explorer lets customers watch videos and stream using YouTube, Prime Video and more. They can also surf the web with the Vivaldi Browser, while Google Chrome is being integrated, or play games through Google Play. The 2025 Explorer can also serve as a Wi-Fi hotspot connecting up to 10 mobile devices to the Internet.

Customers who buy the 2025 Explorer will get one year of complimentary premium connectivity offered at the time of purchase. Ford is still determining whether it will offer monthly or annual subscriptions for the connectivity and whether it will expand or enhance that service, with details set to be announced at a later date.

MUSTANG WILL RACE WORLDWIDE WITH FORD PERFORMANCE MOTORSPORTS IN 60TH ANNIVERSARY YEAR

The new Explorer also continues to uphold the off-road credentials of its predecessors and looks to meet the needs of customers who go on road trips or tow campers or boats for outdoor recreation.

""We know that 90% of Explorer customers use their vehicles for vacations and surprisingly, Millennial customers are more than 50% more likely to go camping and fishing so they use this thing in a manner that it was designed and intended to be used, which is fabulous,"" Marentic said.

He added that younger buyers are also ""more apt than most other large SUV customers to tow"" which is why Ford standardized features like trailer tow.

Ford consolidated the 2025 Explorer to four series, down from eight in the prior year. Those include the value-based Active series which starts at an MSRP of $41,220, the ST-Line; the ST series which has a 400 horsepower 3.0-liter EcoBoost engine; and the Platinum series which has the 400hp 3.0-liter EcoBoost available as well.

THE DETROIT LIONS HAVE AN AUTOMOBILE TITAN BACKING THE TEAM

Ford's BlueCruise hands-free highway driving will be available in the Explorer's ST-Line, ST and Platinum models.

The company also reduced the number of unique parts in the new Explorers to make it easier for the plant to produce with the configurations that customers and dealers are ordering.

""What we've done is we've standardized so much content that customers would typically have already gone and checked the box and ordered this, so the whole thing that we're trying drive is value - that this is such a tremendous value at the price point we offer,"" Marentic explained.

2024-02-01,Suzanne Somers' Palm Springs home on the market for $8.9 million,"The TV icon reflects on creating a beloved character in her last in-depth interview recorded in 2022 for the upcoming FOX Nation series ""The Infomercials That Sold Us.""

Suzanne Somers' former Palm Springs, California, home is officially back on the market.

The five-structure 28-acre property is listed with Scott Lyle at Compass for $8.95 million. It was previously on the market for $12.9 million from April to June 2023.

""When you tour this incredible home with its amazing setting, it's easy to see why it has been such a loved home by its owner and their guests,"" Lyle said. ""There is simply nothing like it.""

The nearly 100-year-old home is just minutes from downtown Palm Springs and has plenty of space with seven bedrooms and 10 bathrooms across a main house and four smaller villas, one of which was designed by Swiss architect Albert Frey.

SUZANNE SOMERS' HUSBAND SAYS HER SPIRIT LIVES ON AFTER DEATH: 'STRANGE THINGS' ARE HAPPENING

The listing describes the house as ""a hidden paradise"" that features 10 outdoor venues, such as a natural rock amphitheater. Additionally, ""intimate walkways, large view terraces and secret patios are interspersed among the buildings,"" which add to the ""unsurpassed beauty"" of the property.

""Terraced on a hillside naturally embellished with dramatically exposed rock, the estate is both impressive and inviting,"" the listing reads. ""An open-air carriage, in the form of a custom funicular, carries passengers up to the residence as panoramic views are revealed below.""

The home also features hiking trails, a lagoon-style pool, an outdoor living room, a 150-outdoor light display and a two-room chef's kitchen with a formal dining area and a secret wine cellar.

The listing promises the home ""is the place all will gather for the perfect winter weather"" and that it will be ""the home you never knew you always wanted.""

Somers lived in the home with her husband, Alan Hamel, for more than 40 years before her death in October 2023. The house has been on the market on and off for many years.

""We are looking for a different lifestyle at this point,"" she told People in 2016 when the house was put on the market. ""After 40 years, I think we all get an itch to change.""

""I want to build something very modern,"" she added, saying she was looking to downsize after her kids got older. ""Two or three bedrooms with large entertaining areas and, of course, another amphitheater. Once you have one, you can't live without it.""

2024-02-01,Rising costs of housing pushing millennials to make 'drastic sacrifices' by living in vans for years,"Freddie Mac says 30-year fixed mortgage rates rose to their highest level in more than 20 years. This has made things tougher on homebuyers because of a lack of supply and demand.

The rising costs of living over the last few years have driven the younger generation to make ""drastic sacrifices"" in order to reset their financial stability or be able to own a home in the future.

Younger people are opting to live in cost-effective vans and showcase their tiny living quarters on TikTok to the fascination of the internet.

Michael Alberse, a TikToker with 57K followers, moved into a van one year out of college while working at Google at the age of 22, which changed his financial future ""forever"" and paved the way to homeownership.

""I chose to live in a van as a short-term sacrifice to almost guarantee my long-term financial future,"" he said.

OHIO MAN COMPLAINING ABOUT RISING FOOD PRICES EATS COSTCO HOT DOGS FOR ENTIRE WEEK: 'BEST $43 I'VE EVER SPENT'

""I chose to buy a van and build it out so I could save money on rent and put those additional dollars into investments... So it's not my forever plan. But at least it's a great start, so I have a strong base for my future.""

Alberse called his motor home ""Ted,"" and lived in it for about a year before selling it after getting ""pretty homesick and lonely.""

After selling the van, he moved in with his parents with his fiance.

Alberse then moved from California and bought a home in Atlanta after transferring teams at Google, he said.

""I have a stationary home... and life looks a little different now, but very fulfilling, very happy,"" he said.

A van-dwelling couple, Court and Nate, have amassed 2.5 million followers showcasing their lives on the road for nearly five years.

Court, 36, said they were able to save over 70K in the first few years of van living. She also said they were able to address any debt that they had and recently bought land in Southern California.

""We did not get into a van to be on an external vacation. We very much set out on this journey with a purpose... to hopefully one day gain some financial stability while still enjoying our lives,"" Court said.

""Before we moved into our first van we were on track to absolutely never be able to own a home one day,"" she said.

SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CELEBRATED FOR POLICY TO GIVE A FULL ROW TO 'PASSENGERS OF SIZE' FOR FREE

""After all this time and all the sacrifices that we've made... there's no way that I could settle going back to a rental. Because for us, that would probably mean we would never be able to buy a home.""

""It's just so expensive. Why is housing so expensive?"" she added

The U.S. median price of a newly-built home is near its all-time peak, which was reached under President Biden. Though, as of the Dec. 2023 reading (the latest available), the price is down from its all-time high reached in Oct. 2022.

As for the U.S.'s average interest rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage, which is tracked weekly by Freddie Mac, the rate is near a multi-decade high, though it has fallen from its Biden-years' peak (reached in Oct. 2023) over the past several weeks.

The interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is currently at 6.625%.

The younger generation is realizing that ""cutting Starbucks and Netflix isn't enough"" to create the financial future of their parents, according to an Orlando-based realtor and TikToker, Freddie Smith.

""I think that's going to be a very popular story in the next three to five years, because people are just now having to make those drastic sacrifices,"" he said.

The issue many younger people are facing when it comes to buying a home is that over the last approximately three years, the median household income can no longer afford the median home, Smith said.

""The biggest problem that Millennials and Gen Z's are having is their income isn't high enough, unfortunately, to qualify for the average house in America,"" he said. ""So to buy a $400,000 home, which is roughly the average cost in America, you're going to need over $100,000 with very little debt to be able to qualify.""

""As far as the living in a van, this is advice that people are taking,"" Smith said. ""I'm seeing this become wildly popular because they're getting rid of that $2,000 rent burden, and they're able to use that money to save for a down payment. Because the bigger the down payment, the less income you need to qualify.""

TikToker Summer Ginther saved enough to afford a down payment after living on the road for three years with her partner. She explained that some of the more unfortunate aspects of van living was having to store waste in a tank that needed to be emptied ""about once a week.""

""We definitely do not get to see our family and friends as often as we'd like to, and we miss having that community feeling.""

A ""vanlife"" couple, Will and Meebs, who have 86K followers, reiterated the hardships of isolation and ""driving for hours in the middle of the night.""

What's hard is ""not meeting anyone else our age (or anyone doing the same thing)"" as well as ""loneliness"" from not seeing friends and family as often.

The couple also said that life in a van can be scary when it comes to extreme weather.

""[During our] first proper night in the van there was a huge storm,"" the couple said on TikTok. ""[We were] so SO worried about lightning and wind.""

Another concern they had was when they tried to hang their clothes to dry after washing them, ""they froze.""

Another TikToker, Dylan Gray, moved into a van in 2019 to save for a home. At the time, he was $3,000 in debt and was working full-time.

""It was the most challenging year mentally and physically,"" he said about living in van. But one year later, he is debt-free and bought his first home.

2024-02-01,Love and money: Big chunk of US couples admit to fighting about finances,"With Valentine's Day approaching and tax season underway, both love and money are in the air.

Although most couples claim to be well-aligned when it comes to their spending and financial futures, new data shows some partners might want to sit down and have a talk.

Fidelity Investments' biennial Couples & Money Study released Thursday found that while 9 out of 10 couples said they communicate well, more than 45% admitted privately that they argue with their significant other about finances at least on occasion, and 1 in 4 pointed to money as the greatest challenge in their relationship.

""Navigating finances within a relationship is a journey filled with diverse perspectives and individual priorities. So, it's not surprising to see so many couples disagree about money,"" said Meredith Stoddard, vice president of education at Fidelity. ""It really reinforces the importance of and need for open communication.""

HERE'S WHICH US CITIES ARE BEST FOR SINGLES TO MINGLE AHEAD OF VALENTINE'S DAY

In conducting the study, Fidelity surveyed 1,794 couples (3,588 individuals) 18 years and older in marriages or long-term relationships. Each adult was polled individually, and then the answers were compared with their partner's to find areas where the couple is - or isn't - on the same page.

Most partners said they planned to retire around the age of 63, while nearly half of respondents said they expect to work part-time in their golden years. Six in 10 couples share the same vision for retirement, but more than half disagreed on how much money they would need to save in order to achieve their goals.

INDIANA COFFEE SHOP LIVID AFTER COUPLE SHOWS UP FOR IMPROMPTU WEDDING CEREMONY: 'TOOK IT OVER'

The top financial concern (54%) voiced by partners was saving enough money for retirement, and 55% said they have no idea how much they should save by the time they retire in order to maintain their current lifestyle.

""Money discussions aren't always easy, but the fact so many couples feel they are in sync and are comfortable talking about financial topics is encouraging, even if the conversations do occasionally end in disagreement,"" Stoddard said.

2024-02-01,Denny's shutters only location in Oakland after more than 54 years due to high crime,"'Neighbors Together Oakland' founder Seneca Scott shares his efforts to fighting back against progressive policies as crime surges Oakland 'The Bottom Line.'

America's diner may always be open, but it's permanently closing a location that's fed generations.

Denny's has closed its location in Oakland, California after 54 years due to high crime in the city.

The restaurant was located at 601 Hegenberg Road. In a company memo shared with local outlets, Denny's said the decision was not one taken lightly.

""However, the safety and well-being of Denny's team members and value guests is our top priority,"" the company said. ""Weighing those factors, the decision has been made to close this location.""

The company retains a Bay Area location at 1776 Powell St. in Emeryville, California.

2024-02-01,Byron Allen offers to buy Paramount Global for $14 billion,"Needham & Company senior media and internet analyst Laura Martin discusses Netflixs wild trading range ahead of earnings on Making Money.

Medial mogul Byron Allen is making another bid to buy Paramount Global after an effort to acquire the conglomerate last year failed to gain traction.

Allen Media Group offered $14.3 billion to purchase Paramount Global, the Wall Street Journal reported citing people familiar with the matter. According to a copy of the offer letter reviewed by the outlet, the group's offer is $28.58 for each voting share of the company's stock and $21.53 per nonvoting share -- amounts that are roughly 50% higher than the 90-day average of both classes of Paramount Global shares.

Including the company's debt, Allen's offer to buy the company is around $30 billion according to the Journal and Reuters. Bloomberg first reported Allen Media Group's latest offer to buy Paramount.

The offer letter viewed by the Journal indicated that Allen Media Group offered to buy Paramount last year, but the company's board declined to entertain the offer as the board expected the price to go up -- although the letter noted, ""Since our last offer, the stock price has declined approximately 37%.""

PARAMOUNT, WARNER BROS DISCOVERY DISCUSS MERGER; WOULD CONSOLIDATE STREAMING SERVICES

Share prices for Paramount's Class-B non-voting stock surged by over 6.6% during Wednesday's trading session and were up more than 2.3% during after hours trading in the wake of the news.

Paramount Class A shares with voting rights rose over 21.5% during Wednesday's trading but gave back over 3.1% of those gains as the stock fell after hours.

Bloomberg reported that if the deal goes through, Allen would sell the Paramount film studio along with some real estate and intellectual property assets, while retaining the company's TV channels and the Paramount+ streaming service with the goal of running them more efficiently.

APPLE, PARAMOUNT REPORTEDLY EYE STREAMING DEAL

Paramount owns several TV networks including the CBS broadcast network and cable offerings, such as Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, MTV, BET, VH1 and others. Allen Media Group previously offered to buy BET from Paramount with a roughly $3 billion offer last year, although the company decided not to sell the network, according to a previous report by the Journal.

Allen Media Group owns TheGrio and The Weather Channel, among other media outlets.

Paramount has been the subject of other merger and acquisition discussions, with Warner Bros. Discovery discussing a merger late last year.

2024-01-31,H&M CEO quits as fashion group fails to keep up with rivals,"H&M unexpectedly announced a change of leadership on Wednesday, with company veteran Daniel Ervér taking over as CEO from Helena Helmersson as the Swedish fashion retailer's performance continues to lag rivals such as Inditex and Shein.

Shares in H&M dropped 12% as the company revealed sales for December and January fell by 4% compared to the previous year, a bad sign for the key Christmas shopping period.

Helmersson, who quit after four years as CEO, said the role had been ""very demanding"" and she did not have the energy to continue.'

WALMART CEO SHARES HOW RETAIL GIANT HELPS ASSOCIATES 'EXCEL IN THEIR CAREER'

Ervér, 42, has been at H&M for 18 years, most recently as head of the retailer's core H&M brand, a role he will keep alongside the CEO job. In an interview with Reuters, the Swede said he had voiced his interest in the role in December and the board took the decision on Wednesday morning.

The world's second-biggest listed fashion retailer after Inditex, H&M has struggled to compete with Zara and online low-priced fast fashion giant Shein, both of which have seen stronger sales growth.

""I think the market will welcome the change after digesting the numbers,"" said Adil Shah, portfolio manager at Storebrand in Oslo, which holds H&M shares.

BOEING CEO SAYS COMPANY HAS 'MUCH TO PROVE'

H&M has focused on profitability rather than sales volumes recently as it aims to reach a 10% operating margin this year, and cuts costs by closing stores and laying off staff.

""The 10% goal on profitability stays, we will work hard to make that goal happen,"" Erver told Reuters.

H&M's fourth-quarter operating profit margin fell to 7.2% from 7.8% in the third quarter.

Measured in local currencies, sales from Dec. 1 to Jan. 29 - the start of its fiscal first quarter - fell by 4%, compared to an increase of 5% in the same period last year. Sales over the fourth quarter had also fallen 4%, more than the market expected.

Inditex's operating margin was 20.3% over the nine-month period to end-October. Sales grew 11.1% over that same period.

H&M's fourth-quarter operating profit was 4.33 billion crowns ($415.4 million), up from 821 million a year earlier but below the 4.57 billion expected by analysts in an LSEG poll.

JPMorgan analysts said the results were disappointing, and that the weakness of H&M's fourth-quarter profit ""slightly reduces (the) credibility"" of the 10% margin target.

2024-01-31,Ambitious news startup The Messenger shuts down after less than a year,"Digital news startup The Messenger is shutting down after less than a year and falling well short of its highly ambitious goals.

In a memo to staff obtained by Fox News Digital, founder Jimmy Finkelstein told staffers Wednesday he was devastated, but the site had ""exhausted every option available"" to raise the money needed to stay afloat.

""This is truly the last thing I wanted, and I am deeply sorry,"" he wrote. ""The Messenger started with an incredibly important mission - to deliver balanced and accurate journalism at a time when Americans' trust in media is at a record low - and I am proud of what we achieved.""

According to multiple reports, Messenger staffers will not get severance packages, and reporters wrote on X they were kicked out of the site's Slack in the middle of a workday. Finkelstein, who previously ran such outlets as The Hill and The Hollywood Reporter, told the staff, ""as a new company, we encountered even more significant challenges than others and could not survive those headwinds.""

JOURNALISM BLOODBATH: 2024 KICKS OFF WITH NUMEROUS MEDIA LAYOFFS, LABOR ISSUES

Billing itself as a ""new kind of news,"" The Messenger hired hundreds of journalists last year at higher-than-average salaries. It pitched itself as a centrist juggernaut that would appeal to readers tired of partisan news coverage on politics, entertainment and sports.

Under Finkelstein, it raised $50 million from various investors before launching last May, opened offices in New York, Washington and Los Angeles - three of the most expensive cities in the country - and set a goal of having a newsroom of 550 journalists by 2024. Executives told the New York Times they hoped to generate $100 million in revenue by the end of the year as well, an eye-popping goal beyond the reach of even established news sites in the crowded digital space.

But it never came close to making that a reality. Throughout its eight-month run, it dealt with economic headwinds hitting other media outlets, as well as what critics said was an outdated advertising and money-making strategy, and reported editorial infighting about the site's direction and coverage. Finkelstein touted the site doing solid traffic, but it wasn't nearly enough to generate the revenue for a staff of its size.

One insider told Fox News Digital The Messenger was simply too ambitious from the jump.

""They should have scaled and didn't need to hire 300 people and open three bureaus,"" they said.

News outlets were withering in their assessment of the troubled site's collapse. Axios called it ""one of the biggest failures of the internet era"" on Wednesday, while the New York Times called it ""one of the biggest busts in the annals of online news.""

Some staffers appeared to learn the news of losing their jobs from reading about it on another site.

""All I know is that if I were to launch a media start-up I'd be sure to rent an entire floor of a downtown Manhattan skyscraper that was 9/10ths empty all day ... and then fail to tell my employees they were laid off until they read about it in the New York Times,"" The Messenger's Jordan Hoffman wrote on X.

James LaPorta wrote on X he learned of being laid off from media reports and was on his way to clean out his desk in Washington.

Other staffers expressed gratitude to readers and their colleagues.

""I've written some difficult stories in my career, but drafting an I've-been-laid-off tweet has to be the hardest,"" reporter Nolan D. McCaskill wrote on X. ""Idk what's next, but thank you to the readers and sources who gave The Messenger a chance -- and the stellar politics team that made this worth the risk.""

According to the New York Times, The Messenger lost $38 million last year, generating a mere $3 million in revenue, and had less than $2 million cash on hand going into 2024.

2024-01-31,Google parent Alphabet sees AI investment providing long-term opportunities,"UBS Wealth Management managing director Jason Katz says the market opportunities once available in e-commerce are now up for grabs in A.I.

For Google and other tech titans, the rise of artificial intelligence remains a big focus for investors as the emerging technology reshapes the tech landscape, transforming the business of search, cloud and advertising but it also comes with a cost.

Shares of Google parent Alphabet fell over 7% on Wednesday, a day after the company reported quarterly results, despite beating expectations on many key metrics the company said capital spending will jump in 2024 as it continues to invest in AI to improve its services.

""We do remain very committed to investing in the AI opportunity across Google DeepMind, Google services, Google Cloud. Capex was up in the fourth quarter to $11 billion, and that was overwhelmingly the investment in our technical infrastructure,"" Ruth Porat, the tech giant's chief financial officer, told FOX Business' Susan Li.

WILL GENERATIVE AI PAY OFF FOR BUSINESSES IN 2024?

SHOULD BUSINESSES DISCLOSE THEIR USE OF AI? MOST AMERICANS SAY YES

There are serious questions about how AI could impact Google's ad business. Advertising remains a powerhouse for Alphabet, accounting for more than 50% of its total revenue. YouTube's ad revenue grew 16% year over year, but overall ad spending has seen a pullback as advertisers rein in spending.

Alphabet's ad revenue for the fourth quarter rose to $65.5 billion from $59 billion in the same period a year ago, just shy of analysts' estimates, also adding to the selling pressure. Shares are marginally lower this year, compared to the Nasdaq Composite's modest 1% gain.

However, Porat says that evolving AI technology could contribute to success across Alphabet's spectrum of services, including cloud computing, which earned its first-ever quarterly profit in 2023.

""The results reflect spreads across industry sectors, there is an increasing contribution from AI,"" Porat said. ""This is clearly an extraordinary time.""

2024-01-31,LARRY KUDLOW: Save America. Retire Joe Biden.,"WARNING-Graphic Footage: FOX Business host Larry Kudlow breaks down the border deal as a 'migrant crime wave' sweeps through the country on 'Kudlow.'

Save America. Kill the bill. I'm talking about the Senate bill on illegal immigration. There's no legislative text yet, but the leaks tell a story of some kind of ""trigger"" system - whereby if 8,500 illegals arrive at the border in one day, or 5,000 illegals arrive for seven days in a row, somehow Joe Biden and Alejandro Mayorkas are going to ""close"" the border. Really?

If they were going to close the border, then they would've already closed the border, but they're not going to close the border - not now, not in the future, not because of some unnecessary legislation because they believe in open borders, without clear national boundaries.

One big global community where we're all friends and we don't mind another 8 million or so illegals coming into our country. No laws, no rules. That's the Biden vision. It's not a very good vision, is it? Speaker Mike Johnson is exactly right when he talks about ""zero tolerance.""

Among the many catastrophes linked to the illegal immigrant catastrophe is a migrant crime wave that is sweeping the country. Quoting from Breitbart News: ""Sanctuary cities and their suburbs are experiencing a crime wave from migrants who are released by the Biden administration after illegally crossing the border between ports of entry. Police, particularly in the Chicago area and New York City, reported significant increases in crime related to migrants relocated to their cities.""

While Joe Biden isn't personally responsible for every lawless act, you reap what you sow. A pair of New York City police officers were allegedly attacked by several migrants near Times Square over the weekend and, incredibly, the suspects were released without bail.

Reported migrant-related crime in Chicago and it's suburbs is mounting daily. Healthcare company Kaiser is now telling its Oakland, California employees not to go outside for lunch. Stores are closing all over the country because of blatant smash-and-grab theft. Carjackings have become commonplace.

Here's another terrible story. A career bureaucrat who worked in President Trump's Commodity Futures Trading Commission was carjacked and shot as he pulled up to meet his wife after work in the middle of downtown Washington, DC.

Fortunately, he's alive. We don't know if migrants were the cause, but Washington has become a lawless sanctuary city, an absolute disgrace to the entire country. Big-city Democrat mayors and blue-state governors are now complaining bitterly about the illegal migration problem. They want more money to solve it, but there is a much simpler approach.

Just close the border now. Build Trump's wall. Go back to Trump's Remain in Mexico policy, a tough policy on catch-and-deport. Then, start backing the long blue line of dedicated cops throughout the country. Stop burdening them with paperwork, like they do in New York City. Stop criticizing them publicly. Start putting law and order back into our political vocabulary.

No matter what the trigger - five thousand, eight thousand, whatever-thousand....if Joe Biden were going to close the border, he would've already closed the border and if Joe Biden were going to back America's great police forces, he would've already backed America's police forces.

2024-01-31,Boeing CEO says company has 'much to prove',"Aviation expert Peter Lemme discusses reports an Alaska Airlines plane was missing some bolts when it left a Boeing factory on The Evening Edit.

Boeing President and CEO Dave Calhoun acknowledged Wednesday the company has ""much to prove"" as it works to regain trust after a door plug panel flew off one of its 737 Max 9 aircraft midflight earlier this month.

In a letter to employees released alongside the company's year-end 2023 results, Calhoun said he remains focused on the incident that occurred on an Alaska Airlines flight and how Boeing can strengthen its quality controls.

""Over the last several weeks I've spoken to many of you, and I've had tough and direct conversations with our customers, regulators and lawmakers,"" Calhoun wrote. ""They are disappointed and we have much to prove to earn our stakeholders' confidence. There is no message or slogan to do that. It will take transparency and demonstrated action - that starts with each of us along with a commitment to listening to each other and speaking up.""

He added, ""We've taken significant steps over the last several years to strengthen our safety and quality processes, but this accident makes it absolutely clear that we have more work to do.""

UNITED EXEC SAYS COVID-19 PANDEMIC MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO BOEING'S PROBLEMS

Boeing has been under the microscope ever since the Jan. 5 incident when a passenger door flew off while the plane was flying at 16,000 feet. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded all 737 Max 9s with plug doors in order to carry out detail inspections.

The ban has since been lifted, but the FAA prohibited Boeing from boosting production of the 737 Max 9s, and the regulator has increased its oversight of the manufacturer.

""This increased scrutiny - whether from ourselves, from our regulator, or from others - will make us better,"" Calhoun wrote in his memo to employees.

ALASKA AIRLINES PLANE MAY HAVE LEFT BOEING FACTORY WITHOUT BOLTS TO SECURE DOOR PLUG: REPORT

As expected, Calhoun did not offer a financial or delivery forecast for 2024, stating that the company must focus on delivering quality airplanes.

For the fourth quarter, Boeing reported an adjusted per-share loss of 47 cents, compared with an adjusted loss of $1.75 per share a year ago. Revenue rose 10% to $22 billion.

Quarterly free cash flow fell to $2.95 billion from $3.13 billion. The company's ailing defense business also logged $139 million in losses on fixed-price development programs.

Business Insider reported the fired Target employees said they purchased a Starbucks X Stanley Cup that the companies launched to much fanfare earlier this month and received their dismissals not long afterwards.

The limited edition cups, which have a $49.95 price tag, debuted Jan. 3.

According to the former employees, higher ups at their Target locations pointed to a rule about workers not being allowed to capitalize on their position as Target employees to ""gain an unfair advantage over guests"" to get products as factoring into the firings, the outlet reported.

2024-01-31,"US guardrail system can't handle heavy EV's, preliminary test crashes indicate","Copenhagen Consensus President Bjorn Lomborg discusses the electric vehicle push and the costly impact it will have on the U.S.

A new study from the University of Nebraska indicates the nation's guardrails are ill-equipped to handle electric vehicles, which weigh thousands of pounds more than the average gas-powered sedan.

Engineers with the university's Midwest Roadside Safety Facility conducted test crashes with an electric-powered pickup truck and a Tesla sedan hurtling toward a guardrail -- the same type found along tens of thousands of miles of roadway across the country.

The report, released Wednesday, concluded that the nation's guardrail was not made to handle vehicles greater than 5,000 pounds.

The results come as transportation officials have been sounding the alarm over the weight disparity between the new battery-powered vehicles and lighter gas-powered ones. Last year, the National Transportation Safety Board expressed concern about the safety risks heavy electric vehicles pose if they collide with lighter vehicles.

ELECTRIC BUSES ARE SITTING UNUSED IN CITIES ACROSS THE US; HERE'S WHY

Road safety officials and organizations say the electric vehicles themselves appear to offer superior protection to their occupants, even if they might prove dangerous to occupants of lighter vehicles. The Rivian truck tested in Nebraska showed almost no damage to the cab's interior after slamming into the concrete barrier, Stolle said.

The extra weight of electric vehicles comes from their outsized batteries needed to achieve a travel range of about 300 miles per charge. The batteries themselves can weigh almost as much as a small gas-powered car. Electric vehicles typically weigh 20% to 50% more than gas-powered vehicles and have lower centers of gravity.

The concern over the EV's weight even extends beyond vehicle-to-vehicle crashes and compatibility with guardrails. The extra weight will affect everything from faster wear on residential streets and driveways to vehicle tires and infrastructure like parking garages.

""A lot of these parking structures were built to hold vehicles that weighed 2,000 to 4,000 pounds -- not 10,000 pounds,"" Michael Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, told The Associated Press.

Valentine's Day is typically viewed as a day filled with love -- or a cloudy day looming over singles' minds.

Fifty-seven percent of single adults are not interested in a relationship or casual dating right now, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

But the holiday centered around spreading and receiving love is celebrated each February 14, and a new study suggests there are certain states that are better for singles than others.

It also noted that Seattle is one of the fastest-growing cities in the country and has one of the highest median annual household incomes, at just over $70,000.

The one downfall, WalletHub noted, was that the city is far from the cheapest.

WalletHub analyst Cassandra Happe told Fox News Digital that the company found ""many cities that performed well in terms of fun and recreation did not fare as well in the economic category.""

She continued, ""Our study has pinpointed some of the best cities for singles seeking thrilling experiences and romantic opportunities.""

Coming in second place was Las Vegas, Nevada -- which WalletHub said is high on the list due to its diverse nightlife options and low crime rate in relation to other cities.

Shockingly, Las Vegas has one of the lowest average beer prices in the U.S., making it a good spot for a date night.

Denver, Colorado, also made the top three cities for singles to live in due to its large number of parks and fitness centers.

Over 90% of the Denver population, WalletHub also said, has broadband internet and a smartphone, meaning it might be a great city to meet a significant other through a dating app.

In a stunning moment during a marathon Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Wednesday, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg stood and apologized to an overflow audience of families of victims who were allegedly harmed by content on social media platforms.

Behind the witnesses, which included the CEOs of major Big Tech platforms like Snap, X, TikTok and Discord, were families of victims who unknowingly bought fentanyl off social media and died or were victims of eating disorders, self-harm and suicide because of harmful social media content. The families held up pictures of their lost loved ones.

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., grilled Zuckerberg after the tech giant leader tried to dodge questions about the responsibility of his platforms' effect on users.

2024-01-31,Novo Nordisk increasing supply of Wegovy as demand continues to grow,"Fox News medical contributor Dr. Marc Siegel discusses how prepared hospital ERs are to treat kids and the side effects of weight loss drugs on 'The Big Money Show.'

For the first time since May, Novo Nordisk is gradually increasing the supply of its highly sought-after weight loss drug Wegovy.

The Danish drugmaker told FOX Business the company is making significant investments in Wegovy, which gained significant attention since 2022 after being touted by high-profile figures and social media users for its weight loss effects.

It ""has been steadily increasing capacity to produce more Wegovy than ever before,"" the company said.

NOVO NORDISK'S WEGOVY REDUCES RISK OF SERIOUS HEART PROBLEMS BY 20%, STUDY SHOWS

With the added supply, the company is essentially ""doubling the amount of the lower dose strengths of the medicine in the U.S. market,"" starting this month.

Simultaneously, the company said it is gradually increasing the overall supply of the drug throughout the rest of the year.

However, it's still warning patients that ""overall demand will continue to exceed supply,"" meaning some patients will still have a hard time filling a prescription.

In May 2023, the company, whose obesity care sales are being driven by the uptake in Wegovy, started to limit the supply of certain dose strengths to wholesalers for distribution to retail pharmacies due to frenzied demand.

ELI LILLY, NOVO NORDISK TEST POPULAR WEIGHT LOSS-RELATED DRUGS ON CHILDREN

The company was trying to ensure that existing patients who really needed the drug had access to it.

Novo faced supply issues for both Wegovy and its diabetes drug Ozempic, which is another version of the drug semaglutide, given their weight loss effects.

In 2022, the frenzied demand prompted both drugs to be temporarily placed on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s list of drug shortages. Both drugs are listed as ""currently available"" on the FDA's site.

While production has ramped up, Novo said it expects it will ""take a couple of weeks"" for product to arrive at pharmacies.

2024-01-31,"Texas official blasts Biden admin for LNG export pause, warns millions of jobs at risk: 'war on energy'","Former Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette weighs in on the Biden administration's pause on natural gas projects and the electric vehicle push.

A Texas elected official is urging Biden's Department of Energy to reconsider the administration's pause on the approval of pending and future applications to export American liquefied natural gas, warning that millions of jobs are on the line.

Commissioner Dawn Buckingham of the Texas General Land Office sent the DOE a letter Wednesday after the Biden administration announced it is delaying consideration of new natural gas export terminals in the U.S.

Buckingham accused the Biden administration of retaliating against the Lone Star State after it defied an order to remove razor wire fence that was implemented to secure its southern border.

Buckingham warned that millions of high-paying jobs are at stake, including those in rural areas of Texas. She also argued that the delay would embolden U.S. adversaries like Russia and Iran as allies in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East would be cut off from ""Texas-led energy security.""

""In light of these facts, it's unconscionable that our own federal government would take such drastic steps with the goal of shutting down this thriving industry,"" Buckingham said.

The commissioner added in a statement to FOX Business that ""Biden's ban on liquid natural gas will do nothing more than put our economy, job availability, and national security at risk.""

US GROCERY CHAIN ELIMINATING PLASTIC SHOPPING BAGS FROM ALL STORES

""If Biden truly cared for the American people, he would stop the nonsensical war on energy and secure the border. As the steward of 13 million acres of state land, I will always defend Texas' right to energy independence and stand up for the hardworking families and countless Texas schoolchildren this reckless policy decision will harm.""

Buckingham's warning echoes industry groups and Republicans who have condemned the pause as a ""win for Russia."" Environmentalists, meanwhile, have cheered the decision as a path forward for tackling climate change.

FOX Business has reached out to the Department of Energy for a response and will update this story accordingly.

LNG, or ""liquefied natural gas,"" occurs when gas is cooled to about -260° F, changing it into a liquid that can be stored and shipped safely aboard specially designed vessels to destinations around the globe. Upon arrival, the gas is reheated to return it to a gaseous state and transported by pipeline to distribution companies, industrial consumers and power plants.

22 STATES TAKE AIM AT SEC OVER CLIMATE REGULATIONS CREATING NEW TYPE OF COMPANY

Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said the pause will have no immediate effect on U.S. gas supplies to Europe or Asia.

Seven LNG terminals are currently operating in the U.S., mostly in Louisiana and Texas, with up to five more expected to come online in the next few years. Biden's action would not affect those projects, but could delay a dozen or more LNG projects that are pending or in various stages of planning. If necessary, the Energy Department can allow exceptions for national security needs.

It's not clear how long the pause will last, but officials are expected to study how proposed LNG projects will affect the environment, the economy and national security, a process expected to last months.

A public comment period after that will likely delay any decisions on pending LNG projects until after the November election.

The Texas General Land Office oversees millions of acres of state land on which oil and gas are developed, and contributes funds raised from energy leases to the state's educational funds.

2024-01-31,"TikTok CEO grilled on Chinese Communist Party influence, searches of Taylor Swift vs. Tiananmen Square","TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew repeatedly denied under oath an affiliation with the Chinese Community Party on Wednesday, as U.S. senators grilled him during a hearing on Big Tech and the online child exploitation crisis.

Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Tom Cotton, R-Ark., referenced how TikTok, which is controlled by the Chinese company ByteDance, is subject to a 2017 national intelligence law requiring Chinese companies to hand over data to the Chinese government.

Chew, who repeatedly testified he serves his nation of Singapore and has not pursued Chinese citizenship or a passport from China or any other nation, tried to make the distinction that it would be only the Chinese companies controlled by ByteDance that would be subject to the law and said efforts like Project Texas, implemented to store the TikTok data of American users on American soil, is a safeguard.

""Isn't it the case that Bytedance also has an internal Chinese Communist Party committee?"" Cotton said.

GRAHAM TELLS ZUCKERBERG, 'YOU HAVE BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS,' AUDIENCE CHEERS

""Like I said, all businesses that operate in China have to follow the law,"" Chew responded.

""So your parent company is subject to the national security law that requires it to answer to the party. It has its own internal Chinese Communist Party committee. You answer to that parent company. But you expect us to believe that you're not under the influence of the Chinese Communist Party?"" Cotton said.

Chew, who resides in Singapore with his wife and children, all American citizens, testified that he used to work as the chief financial officer of ByteDance. Cotton noted how the CCP's China and Internet Investment Fund purchased a 1% stake in Bytedance's main Chinese subsidiary, the Bytedance Technology Company. And in return for that 1% golden share, Cotton said the party took one of three board seats at that subsidiary company.

Chew insisted it was only a ""coincidence"" that the deal was finalized on April 30, 2021, and he was appointed the CEO of TikTok the very next day, on May 1, 2021.

""It's a coincidence,"" Cotton responded, to which Chew inisted, ""It is.""

""That's a hell of a coincidence,"" Cotton exclaimed.

X CEO LINDA YACCARINO TO OUTLINE PLATFORM'S MEASURES AGAINST CHILD SEX ABUSE AT SENATE HEARING

Before working for ByteDance, as Cotton noted, Chew worked for a Chinese company for about five years and lived in Beijing then. That same company was sanctioned by the United States in 2021 for ""being a communist Chinese military company,"" Cotton explained, but the Biden administration later reversed those sanctions.

Earlier, Cruz asserted that China's version of TikTok - Douyin - feeds beneficial and educational materials to children on the Chinese mainland. But the same's not the case in the United States.

""Now, you said earlier - you said, and I wrote this down, 'We have not been asked for any data by the Chinese government, and we have never provided it,'"" Cruz said, quoting Chew's earlier testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""I'm going to tell you and I told this when you and I met last week in my office, I do not believe you. And I'll tell you, the American people don't either. If you look at what is on TikTok in China, you are promoting to kids science and math videos, educational videos, you limit the amount of time kids can be on Tik Tok. In the United States, you are promoting to kids self-harm videos and anti-Israel propaganda. Why is there such a dramatic difference?'

Cruz cited a study contrasting searches for Taylor Swift or former President Trump against other terms the CCP might be intent on censoring, such as Uyghur, the mostly Muslim ethnic group in China, as well as Hong Kong, where widespread anti-Chinese government protests unfolded in recent years, and Tiananmen Square, the Beijing site of the 1989 massacre of hundreds to thousands of students.

""So for something like hashtag Taylor Swift or hashtag Trump, researchers found roughly two Instagram posts for everyone one on Tik Tok, that's not a dramatic difference. That difference drops jumps to 8 to 1 for the hashtag Uyghur and it jumps to 30 to 1 for the hashtag Tibet and it jumps to 57 to 1 to the hashtag Tiananmen Square and it jumps to 174 to 1 for the hashtag Hong Kong protest,"" Cruz explained. ""Why is it that on Instagram people can put up hashtag Hong Kong protest 174 times compared to Tik Tok? What censorship is Tik Tok doing at the request of the Chinese government?""

Chew insisted that the study had been ""debunked"" and TikTok does not suppress content. ""This analysis is flawed. You're selectively choosing some words, some periods. We haven't been around this obvious difference,"" Chew said.

Cotton also pressed the TikTok CEO to clarify that the Tiananmen Square massacre was more than simply a ""protest,"" and whether he agreed with both the Trump and Biden administration's assertion that the Chinese government is committing genocide against the Uyghur people. But Chew dodged, instead stressing that ""anyone who cares about this topic or any topic freely express themselves on TikTok.""

""Joe Biden last year said that Jinping was a dictator. Do you agree with Joe Biden, the position being a dictator?"" Cotton asked, but Chew declined to comment on any world leaders.

""Are you afraid that you'll lose your job if you say anything negative about the Chinese Communist Party?"" Cotton asked. Chew insisted that content critical of China could also be found on TikTok. ""Are you scared that you'll be arrested and disappeared the next time you go to mainland China?""

Cotton cited Arkansas teenagers who killed themselves after being fed thousands of videos glorifying suicide on TikTok. Meanwhile, under the Biden administration, the Federal Trade Commission has not sued TikTok, like it has with Elon Musk's X, as well as Facebook.

Cotton cited how Cristina Caffarra, a former paid adviser to ByteDance, was later hired by the Biden FTC to advise on how to sue Mark Zuckerberg's company, and public reports indicated TikTok lobbyists visited the White House more than 40 times in 2022. Chew said he could not answer as to how many White House visits TikTok lobbyists made in 2023.

""So all these companies are being sued by FTC. You're not. The FTC has a former paid adviser of your parent talking about how they can sue Mr. Zuckerberg's company. Joe Biden's re-election campaign, the Democratic National Committee is on your platform. Let me ask you, have you or anyone else at TikTok communicated with or coordinated with the Biden administration, the Biden campaign or the Democratic National Committee to influence the flow of information on your platform?"" Cotton said. ""We have a company that is a tool, the Chinese Communist Party, that is poisoning the minds of America's children.

2024-01-31,"Fed holds interest rates steady, signals it is not ready to start reducing rates","Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer of The Bahnsen Group, David Bahnsen, joined 'Varney & Co.' to discuss stocks and inflation data ahead of the next Fed meeting.

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday held interest rates steady for the fourth straight time. The widely expected decision left interest rates unchanged at a range of 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest level in 22 years.

Hiking interest rates tends to create higher rates on consumer and business loans, which then slows the economy by forcing employers to cut back on spending. Higher rates have helped push the average rate on 30-year mortgages above 8% for the first time in decades. Borrowing costs for everything from home equity lines of credit, auto loans and credit cards have also spiked.

In the span of just 16 months, interest rates surged from near zero to above 5%, the fastest pace of tightening since the 1980s. While inflation has cooled considerably in recent months, it remains up 3.4% compared with the same time a year ago, according to the most recent Labor Department data. Even with the recent declines, Americans continue to pay more for a number of necessities including food, medical care and rent.

FED'S FIGHT AGAINST INFLATION IS WEIGHING ON MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICANS

Yet the rapid rise in rates has not stopped consumers from spending or businesses from hiring.

The labor market is continuing to chug along at a healthy pace, with employers adding 216,000 new workers in December. Job openings remain high, and the unemployment rate is continuing to hover around 3.7%.

2024-01-31,Bud Light sales down nearly 30% year over year as rivals continue to climb,"UFC president Dana White reacts to making Bud Light UFCs official beer after the beer giant faced intense backlash following its partnership with trans activist Dylan Mulvaney on Hannity.

Anheuser-Busch InBev's beleaguered Bud Light brand is still having trouble luring back the customers it lost following its controversial partnership with transgender activist Dylan Mulvaney last year.

Bud Light sales were down 29.9% year over year for the week ending Jan. 20, 2024 compared with the same period last year, according to the latest numbers provided to FOX Business by Bump Williams Consulting, which analyzed Neilsen IQ data.

Sales of A-B's signature Budweiser brand were also down 15% on an annualized basis for the week, while competitors saw growth.

BUDWEISER'S CLYDESDALES RETURN FOR SUPER BOWL LVIII

Molson-Coors' Coors Light saw 12.2% sales growth, while Miller Lite sales rose 6.9%, and Yuengling Light soared by 72.3%.

Modelo Especial, the Mexican lager owned by Constellation Brands, also gained further ground against Bud Light, seeing a 10.8% sales boost on the week compared with the same time in 2023, when Modelo eclipsed the A-B brand to become the best-selling beer in the U.S.

Sales of Bud Light began to tumble in the U.S. in April of last year, not long after the brand created and sent custom beer cans to Mulvaney to mark her ""365 days of girlhood.""

ANSON FRERICKS 'OPTIMISTIC' COMPANIES WILL BE LESS INVOLVED, DIVISIVE GOING FORWARD

That move and comments from Bud Light's marketing vice president at the time, Alissa Heinerscheid - who said she wanted to update the ""fratty"" and ""out of touch"" brand - sparked calls from conservative influencers and celebrities to shun the brand, and a boycott took hold.

AB InBev has since worked to rehabilitate the brand's image, with limited success.

2024-01-31,SEC's X account hack rehashes concerns over agency's data security,"'Coin Stories' podcast host Natalie Brunell discusses whether Bitcoin could drop below $20K in 2024 on 'The Big Money Show.'

Congressional Republicans are citing the recent hack of the Securities and Exchange Commission's official account on social media platform X as grounds for redoubling efforts to restrict the agency's ability to collect large amounts of private investor data, FOX Business has learned.

Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy, a member of the Senate Banking Committee which oversees the SEC, exclusively told FOX Business that the risk to investor privacy is ""clearer than ever"" after an unknown party on Jan. 9 gained unauthorized access to the official SEC account on X and posted an erroneous message to the agency's 750,000 followers, announcing the SEC had approved the launch of 11 new bitcoin ETFs.

Kennedy plans to push harder for legislation he introduced to the Senate in June that would restrict the SEC's mining of investors' financial and personal data, he told FOX Business.

SPOT BITCOIN ETFS APPROVED BY SEC

""The recent hacking of the SEC's X account proves just how badly Americans need the Protecting Investors' Personally Identifiable Information Act to safeguard their sensitive data,"" Kennedy said in a statement to FOX Business. ""The risk is clearer than ever, as is Congress's responsibility to act.""

Several federal agencies, including the FBI, the SEC's Office of the Inspector General, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (which oversees the bitcoin futures market) and the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, have launched their own investigations into the matter. Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., have requested an update from the Office of the Inspector General on its investigation to be delivered no later than Feb. 12.

The SEC had no official comment but previously stated that staff had not identified any evidence that the unauthorized party gained access to any other SEC systems or data.

The highly anticipated approval announcement of the bitcoin ETF was expected to come from the agency the day after the data breach. The fake post caused the price of bitcoin to briefly spike from $46,730 to nearly $48,000 before SEC staff were able to regain control of the account and announce no decision had been made. Minutes later, bitcoin suffered a mini-crash, falling 4.5% to around $45,000, causing significant investor losses.

A subsequent investigation by X revealed the hack occurred because the account did not have multifactor authentication enabled, a verification method that helps guard against hacking attempts. The SEC admitted that two-factor authentication was turned off in June at the request of staff, meaning the account was left vulnerable for at least six months before the hack. The SEC has said two-factor authentication is currently enabled for all SEC social media accounts that offer it.

VALKYRIE INVESTMENTS FIRST TO OFFER ETHER FUTURES THROUGH ETF

The party behind the account breach has yet to be revealed publicly. It is unclear if the SEC knows the party's identity.

The event has led to questions from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle about internal cyber safety practices at the SEC, which itself mandates strict cybersecurity compliance from the public companies it regulates. The SEC controls large databases of investor information, like the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT), which tracks all equities and options trades made in the U.S. and subsequently stores investors' financial and personal information.

At issue for lawmakers is whether criminals or terrorists can gain easy access to this information to make illicit profits or pursue widespread identity theft and possibly destabilize the U.S. financial system.

Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., introduced companion legislation in the House that he said would help prevent either an accidental or intentional breach by restricting the SEC's ability to collect data in the first place.

The CAT database was created in 2016 but has been expanded under current Chairman Gary Gensler. The data collection effort has also drawn the ire of other regulatory agencies like the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and industry trade groups like the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association that represent broker-dealers that are required to pay high fees to fund the operation of the database.

Wall Street magnates Citadel Securities and the American Securities Association sued the SEC in October over the Commission's approval of the new CAT funding model that forces brokerage firms to foot some of the bill.

Citadel and the ASA said the SEC ""overstepped its statutory authority and failed to address investor and industry concerns"" when it signed off on the funding plan.

However, the SEC believes CAT is instrumental in improving investor protection and market integrity by providing surveillance across all areas of U.S. markets. Former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, Gensler's predecessor, says CAT was intended to enhance the regulatory oversight of the securities markets. In remarks delivered in September, Gensler said CAT has benefited the Commission in surveillance and enforcement work.",Congressional Republicans are citing the recent hack of the Securities and Exchange Commission's official account on social media platform X.

In less than two weeks, the San Francisco 49ers will face off against the Kansas City Chiefs in Las Vegas for Super Bowl LVIII - and one of the NFL team's presidents is hoping Taylor Swift can make it.

""I think it's fantastic,"" 49ers President Al Guido said of Swift's presence at games on ""Varney & Co."" Wednesday.

He also confirmed wanting the Grammy-award-winning artist at the Super Bowl: ""We should all lean into this. It is a great story.""

The same week of the Super Bowl, Swift has four performances scheduled in Japan. Speculation has swirled about whether Swift can make it back in time for the Feb. 11 game.

SUPER BOWL FLIGHTS ADDED WITH TAYLOR SWIFT, TRAVIS KELCE-THEMED NUMBERS

If the singer-songwriter ends her concert around 11 p.m. EST and gets on an airplane by midnight on Feb. 11 in Japan, a 12-hour flight will put her in Las Vegas on Feb. 10. She could have some likely much-needed recovery sleep and get ready to cheer on her favorite NFL player - Travis Kelce - at Allegiant Stadium.

Swift adding a strong female interest in the male-dominated sport is a positive change of pace, according to Guido, who also noted the recent NFL apparel licensing success for Kristin Juszczyk, wife of 49ers fullback Kyle Juszczyk.

""We have a wife on our team, Kristin, [she] actually made her [own] jacket... she wore to one of their games. Now she's an NFL-licensed apparel designer,"" the president pointed out.

""As a father of three girls that had Taylor Swift twice in Levi Stadium this year, she did $33 million in economic impact within two days. This is great for all of us,"" Guido continued.

Swift and Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce went public with their romantic relationship in September. Now, sports fan bets have started offering odds on whether Kelce will propose to Swift following a potential Super Bowl win.

On FanDuel Canada, the odds opened up at +140 for ""yes"" (a $100 bet wins $190), while ""no"" began at -170 (must bet $170 to win $100).

However, Canadian bettors thought those lines were ridiculous, and started to slam ""no.""

As of Tuesday afternoon, a $100 bet on ""yes"" would net $920, while you would have to wager $2,200 on ""no"" to even make $100.

2024-01-31,Private student loan interest rates plummet for 5-and 10-year loans,"During the week of Jan. 22, 2024, average private student loan rates dropped for borrowers with credit scores of 720 or higher who used the Credible marketplace to take out 10-year fixed-rate loans and 5-year variable-rate loans.

Through Credible, you can compare private student loan rates from multiple lenders.

For 10-year fixed private student loans and 5-year variable student loans, interest rates fell by nearly half a percentage point.

Borrowers with good credit may find a lower rate with a private student loan than with some federal loans. For the 2023-24 academic school year, federal student loan rates will range from 5.50% to 8.05%. Private student loan rates for borrowers with good to excellent credit can be lower right now.

Because federal loans come with certain benefits, like access to income-driven repayment plans, you should always exhaust federal student loan options first before turning to private student loans to cover any funding gaps. Private lenders such as banks, credit unions, and online lenders provide private student loans. You can use private loans to pay for education costs and living expenses, which might not be covered by your federal education loans.

Interest rates and terms on private student loans can vary depending on your financial situation, credit history, and the lender you choose.

Take a look at Credible partner lenders' rates for borrowers who used the Credible marketplace to select a lender during the week of January 22:

Congress sets federal student loan interest rates each year. These fixed interest rates depend on the type of federal loan you take out, your dependency status and your year in school.

Private student loan interest rates can be fixed or variable and depend on your credit, repayment term and other factors. As a general rule, the better your credit score, the lower your interest rate is likely to be.

You can compare rates from multiple student loan lenders using Credible.

An interest rate is a percentage of the loan periodically tacked onto your balance -- essentially the cost of borrowing money. Interest is one way lenders can make money from loans. Your monthly payment often pays interest first, with the rest going to the amount you initially borrowed (the principal).

Getting a low interest rate could help you save money over the life of the loan and pay off your debt faster.

Here's the difference between a fixed and variable rate:

Comparison shopping for private student loan rates is easy when you use Credible.

Using a student loan interest calculator will help you estimate your monthly payments and the total amount you'll owe over the life of your federal or private student loans.

Once you enter your information, you'll be able to see what your estimated monthly payment will be, the total you'll pay in interest over the life of the loan and the total amount you'll pay back.

Credible is a multi-lender marketplace that empowers consumers to discover financial products that are the best fit for their unique circumstances. Credible's integrations with leading lenders and credit bureaus allow consumers to quickly compare accurate, personalized loan options - without putting their personal information at risk or affecting their credit score.

2024-01-31,Stuart Varney: Biden will likely lose 2024 election over the border crisis,"Varney & Co. host Stuart Varney blasted Biden for refusing to accept responsibility for the migrant crisis he created.

During his ""My Take,"" Wednesday, ""Varney & Co."" host Stuart Varney roasted Biden for his failure to secure the southern border, arguing the president's refusal to accept responsibility for the flood of illegal migrants entering the U.S. will likely cost him the 2024 presidential election.

STUART VARNEY: The numbers from the border tell a story of monumental failure.

But President Biden takes no responsibility.

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ADMITS BORDER ISN'T SECURE AFTER CLAIMING IMMIGRATION WAS NOT A CRISIS

In 2020, the last full year of the Trump administration, 458,000 migrants came into our country.

In 2023, with Biden as president for three years, that number reached 2.5 million.

In the last three months, activity has picked up even more. 785,000 came in.

That's an average of 8,600 a day.

BIDEN CLAIMS 'I'VE DONE ALL I CAN DO' TO SECURE THE BORDER

Here is the president's response:

""I've done all I can do. Give me the power. I asked them the very day I got into the office. Give me the border patrol. Give me the judges. Give me the people who can stop this.""

I would suggest the president has done everything he can to speed up and increase the flow.

He wants millions of illegals. He invited them in. He thought he was importing future Democratic voters.

All across the country, you can see the impact of mass, illegal migration. Voters surely don't like it.

In Times Square, two police officers were beaten by a migrant mob.

NYPD OFFICERS ATTACKED NEAR TIMES SQUARE BY MIGRANTS LATER FREED WITHOUT BAIL

Four suspects were arrested and released without bail. They are back on the streets.

Does anyone believe that Biden is going to get a grip on the border? No way.

Biden thought migration was a winning issue last time around.","Varney & Co. host blasted Biden for his failure to secure the southern border.

2024-01-31,Many consumers carrying a credit balance know it's a bad idea: survey,"Americans know that carrying a credit card balance is a bad idea, but 45% typically do so anyway, a recent survey said.

Consumers of all ages and financial backgrounds are amassing credit card debt, and struggling to live within their means, and these behaviors are only getting worse, the Quicken survey said. Roughly 77% said they owned a credit card. Half (50%) of the consumers earning an annual income between $50,000-$99,000 said they relied on credit cards, rather than cash, for the bulk of their purchases.

Americans now owe $1.08 trillion on their credit cards after racking up a collective $48 billion in new spending during the third quarter of 2023, according to a recent report on household debt from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Most Americans (81%) said paying off credit cards was essential and 64% said carrying a credit card balance was not a good idea. However, 45% typically carry one month-to-month. Even more concerning, over 52% of Gen Z and Millennial Americans say their credit card balance has been steadily growing over the past three to five years, with almost half (48%) admitting to this in America's middle class and over a third (35%) in the highest income bracket of those making more than $200,000.

""Even with people knowing what they should and shouldn't do with credit cards, they often make the mistakes anyway,"" Quicken CEO Eric Dunn said. ""This suggests that many consumers don't feel they have a choice.

""But credit card debt is costly, so as that debt rises, it really hurts people's financial health,"" Dunn continued.

SOCIAL SECURITY: COLA INCREASING BUT MEDICARE COSTS RISING TOO IN 2024

Consumers' growing debt burden means they have less cushion for emergencies and less funds to put away in savings. Fifty-four percent of middle-class Americans and 56% of younger Americans said their current savings wouldn't last over three months if they were to lose their source of income.

It's not just middle class America feeling the impact of growing debt, according to the survey. Over one quarter (28%) of those making over $200,000 a year said their savings would last only three months if they were to lose their source of income. Financial experts recommend that consumers have roughly three to six months' worth of living expenses in emergency savings, but inflation and rising costs have made this target a challenge.

Inflation and rising costs were listed as the top financial concerns for over 50% of respondents and the most significant reason Americans cannot build savings in a recent TaxAct survey. This concern has even impacted Americans in higher tax brackets - 55% of consumers with household incomes between $50,000 and $99,999 also cited inflation as their top financial worry, the survey said.

If you are struggling to pay off debt, you could consider using a personal loan to consolidate your payments at a lower interest rate, saving you money each month. You can visit Credible to find your personalized interest rate without affecting your credit score.

AMERICANS LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK OWN 60% OF CREDIT CARD DEBT: SURVEY

The good news is that Americans are growing more confident about their finances. WalletHub 2024 Economic Index increased by 15% between December 2022 and December 2023. This means consumers are more optimistic about their financial outlook this month than they were at the same time last year. Moreover, their six-month outlook on their finances reached the highest level of optimism recorded since December 2020.

The index said that the share of consumers who expected to have less debt after the next six months increased by 4.4% in December 2023 compared to last year. In addition, consumers' confidence in reducing their debt over the next six months has hit the highest level recorded since December 2020.

""The 15% increase in consumer sentiment over the past year is an encouraging sign that our economy is recovering from the damage it suffered as a result of the pandemic and inflation,"" WalletHub Analyst Cassandra Happe said.

2024-01-31,TikTok to lose Taylor Swift music amid tiff with label Universal Music Group,"Entertainment journalist Kim Serafin and sports agent Doug Eldridge discuss Taylor Swift and her recent impact on NFL ticket prices.

Taylor Swift and other stars' music could disappear from TikTok after Universal Music Group (UMG) announced Tuesday that its negotiations for a renewed licensing agreement with the popular short video platform yielded no results.

In an open letter penned this week, UMG explained that its contract with the app expires on Jan. 31, noting that its stance in the negotiations has emphasized three ""critical issues,"" mentioning ""appropriate compensation for our artists and songwriters, protecting human artists from the harmful effects of AI, and online safety for TikTok's users.""

""TikTok proposed paying our artists and songwriters at a rate that is a fraction of the rate that similarly situated major social platforms pay,"" the letter explained.

TAYLOR SWIFT ACHIEVES BILLIONAIRE STATUS AMID NEW ROMANCE, RECORD-BREAKING TOUR AND '1989 (TAYLOR'S VERSION)'

""Today, as an indication of how little TikTok compensates artists and songwriters, despite its massive and growing user base, rapidly rising advertising revenue and increasing reliance on music-based content, TikTok accounts for only about 1% of our total revenue.""

UMG succinctly followed by saying, ""Ultimately TikTok is trying to build a music-based business, without paying fair value for the music.""

The label's letter also called out TikTok's leniency on artificial intelligence, noting that the platform not only allows AI-generated recordings to circulate among its content, but also enables users to create AI music on the platform itself.

""[TikTok then demands] a contractual right which would allow this content to massively dilute the royalty pool for human artists, in a move that is nothing short of sponsoring artist replacement by AI,"" UMG stated.

TAYLOR SWIFT, KIM KARDASHIAN BUILT BILLION-DOLLAR BUSINESS EMPIRES

In a third swipe, UMG's letter argued that TikTok fails to adequately address ""content adjacency issues"" and offers no efficient way to remove ""problematic content,"" including explicit deepfakes, from its platform.

They accused TikTok of ""bullying"" them into accepting a deal of lesser value than the previous deal during the negotiation process.

""How did it try to intimidate us? By selectively removing the music of certain of our developing artists, while keeping on the platform our audience-driving global stars.""

""TikTok's tactics are obvious: use its platform power to hurt vulnerable artists and try to intimidate us into conceding to a bad deal that undervalues music and shortchanges artists and songwriters as well as their fans. We will never do that,"" UMG said.

TAYLOR SWIFT LITTLE GOLDEN BOOK BIOGRAPHY SELLS 1M COPIES IN 7 MONTHS

TikTok fired back at UMG in a statement responding to the complaints Tuesday, accusing the label of ""greed"" and prioritizing money over the best interest of its artists.

""Despite Universal's false narrative and rhetoric, the fact is they have chosen to walk away from the powerful support of a platform with well over a billion users that serves as a free promotional and discovery vehicle for their talent.""

""TikTok has been able to reach 'artist-first' agreements with every other label and publisher. Clearly, Universal's self-serving actions are not in the best interests of artists, songwriters and fans,"" the remainder of the statement read in full.

Universal Music Group also represents other popular artists, including Drake.","UMG's contract with TikTok expires on Jan. 31. UMG says it has emphasized ""critical issues"" in negotiations.

2024-01-31,Walmart announces 3-for-1 stock split,"Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner shares the lessons he's learned that help him to lead the company today.

Walmart inc. announced a three-for-one stock split easing the barrier for employees and investors to buy shares.

The Arkansas-based company said the stock split is part of its ""ongoing review of optimal trading and spread levels and its desire for its associates to feel that purchasing shares is easily within reach.""

The announcement comes as the company's stock is trading just below its all-time high of nearly $170 per share reached in November 2021.

Walmart CEO Dough McMillon said in a statement that the company's founder, Sam Walton, was a firm believer in keeping the share price within a range where purchasing whole share, not fractions, was accessible.

With a three-for-one stock split, each old share becomes equal to three shares. In turn, the price per share becomes cheaper. So far this year, shares are up nearly 6% outpacing the S&P 500's 2% rise.

WALMART CREATING 150 NEW STORES, REDESIGNING HUNDREDS MORE

In total, over 40,000 of its employees currently participate in the company's Walmart's Associate Stock Purchase Plan, which gives them the ability to buy stock through payroll deductions.

It also provides a 15% company match on the first $1,800 each year, according to Walmart.

Shareholders will receive a distribution of two additional shares of common stock for each share held, Walmart said.

The shares to be issued in the stock split will be payable after market close on Feb. 23 for shareholders of record at the close of business the day before.

McMillon said that given the company's growth and its future plans, they believed it was a good time to create the stock split.

In the U.S. alone, the company just announced it was developing and enhancing hundreds of stores over the next five years. It will mark the first time since November 2021 that Walmart opens a store.

New stores will be a mix of 182,000-square-foot Walmart Supercenters that employ about 300 and 38,000-square-foot Neighborhood Markets that employ up to 95.

As such, hundreds of jobs will open up in various communities around the nation.","Walmart inc. announces a three-for-one stock split easing the barrier for employees and investors to buy shares.

2024-01-31,Trucker warns over impact of EVs: Failure of technology could be 'catastrophic',"JKC Trucking co-owner and Vice President Mike Kucharski says the long-distance range for electric trucks is 'not practical' during an appearance on 'The Big Money Show.'

As Biden pushes green energy policies, trucking companies have warned of new challenges facing not only the industry but also the overall economy.

During an interview on FOX Business' ""The Big Money Show,"" JKC Trucking co-owner Mike Kucharski explained that while he supports the integration of green energy, new EPA regulations are ""extremely frustrating"" and cautioned that technology could come at a ""catastrophic"" price.

He warned that the trucking industry is particularly susceptible to the consequences of pushing electric vehicles ""too fast with little testing and data.""

TRUCKERS CHALLENGE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S NEW EMISSION RULES: MATTER OF 'LIFE AND DEATH'

""Electric trucks, No. 1, are too expensive, and this technology is being pushed through way, way too fast with little testing and data,"" he shared.

""Truckers need proven technology, because if technology fails, the entire supply chain will be dead in the water. Failure is not merely inconvenient, it's catastrophic. And this is not an option, especially for the food supply chain of America.""

In April 2023, the Biden White House announced aggressive regulations for tailpipe emissions as part of its sweeping climate agenda and efforts to push Americans to buy electric vehicles (EVs).

The tailpipe emissions regulations will impact light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles alike. The new standards for heavy-duty trucks, specifically, aim to reduce carbon emissions for trucks beginning with model year 2027.

The April restrictions come on the heels of regulations on nitrogen oxide pollution which raised similar concerns for small business truckers.

TRUCKING COMPANY WARNS NEW EPA STANDARDS WILL KILL MOM-AND-POP BUSINESSES

""The issues that we're having with the trucks, with the heavy trucks, No. 1, this mandate is brand-new technology, and I support green energy. But it's extremely frustrating because I don't agree with the EPA. Because these regulations are not practical,"" Kucharski said.

He went on to list the five major issues with EV trucks.

""Number one, costs are astronomical. Too expensive. Two, infrastructure - power grid not ready, not enough charging stations. Three, testing and data is being done right now. We need more testing data.""

""Four, driving range or range anxiety is real. Long-distance driving truck range for electric trucks is not practical. And then five, less cargo capacity due to the weight of the batteries. This will cause less goods and less foods delivered to the American people.""

As a supporter of green energy, Kucharski said a hybrid vehicle is a good option for those looking to integrate new regulations while also maintaining the integrity of the trucking industry.

""Truckers need an affordable hybrid truck, as you say, with two power system. Because if one shuts down or breaks, the other one continues,"" he said.

Valentine's Day is celebrated each Feb. 14 -- and this year a cookie company is offering customers a chance to be single just in time for the holiday.

Insomnia Cookies announced the release of custom cookie delivery boxes ahead of Valentine's Day to break up in a ""low-key"" fashion with your fling before the day of love arrives.

The company, a cookie brand based in Pennsylvania, is offering a limited-time cookie box called the ""It's Not Me, It's You"" pack.

SWEETHEARTS LIMITED-EDITION 'SITUATIONSHIP' CANDY BOXES FULL OF 'BLURRY' MESSAGES FLY OFF SHELVES

Upon the package's arrival, recipients of the box of warm cookies will open the lid to read a special message from the sender.

Options for the message include, ""It's not me, it's you,"" ""You're sweet, but not my taste,"" ""Have the hots for your roommate,"" and ""We're done. Have a nice life.""

Insomnia said in a press release that the cookie delivery messaging is a ""very unserious way of ending things, since warm cookies [are] better than a cold heart.""

COMPANIES THAT PROFIT THE MOST FROM LOVE AROUND VALENTINE'S DAY

Brand director Gab Dolceamore told Fox News Digital that the company is excited to be launching the limited-edition cookie pack this Valentine's Day.

""Breaking up with your significant other can be a real downer, so we wanted to provide a lighthearted -- somewhat unserious -- alternative to a text message for Insomniacs whose current flings have crumbled,"" she said.

The late-night cookie delivery brand started when founder Seth Berkowitz wanted a sweet and warm treat delivered to his dorm room at the University of Pennsylvania in 2003, according to the brand's website.

VALENTINE'S DAY CHOCOLATES JUST GOT MORE EXPENSIVE

With an idea and a dream, Berkowitz then opened its first brick-and-mortar store in Syracuse, New York, in 2006 -- and the brand has been growing ever since.

In 2021, Insomnia Cookies opened its 200th store -- and plans for a new headquarters in downtown Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, were announced in 2022.

2024-01-31,X CEO Linda Yaccarino to outline platform's measures against child sex abuse at Senate hearing,"Former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi discusses the WSJ's investigation into Instagram and the alleged exploitation of children on the platform on 'The Bottom Line.'

Leaders of several social media platforms, including X CEO Linda Yaccarino, are set to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday regarding efforts to counter the sexual exploitation of children online.

Yaccarino, who took the helm of the platform formerly known as Twitter in June, will testify alongside Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook and Instagram parent Meta, as well as TikTok CEO Shou Chew, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel and Discord CEO Jason Citron. Their testimony comes as senators on the panel have advanced multiple bills that would ramp up protections aimed at eliminating online child sexual exploitation (CSE).

The testimony also comes days after X temporarily blocked searches for Taylor Swift after fake sexually explicit images of the pop star that were generated with AI began circulating on social media last week.

Since the takeover of Twitter by the Elon Musk-led ownership group in late 2022 and its subsequent rebranding as X, the platform has struggled to reassure advertisers that it has sufficient content moderation policies in place. In a draft version of Yaccarino's opening remarks provided to FOX Business, she sought to emphasize the steps that the platform has taken to root out CSE.

""In the last 14 months, X has made material changes to protect children: Our policy is clear - X has zero tolerance towards any material that features or promotes child sexual exploitation,"" Yaccarino said.

ELON MUSK'S X TO HIRE 100 CONTENT MODERATORS IN AUSTIN THIS YEAR

""My written testimony details X's extensive policies on content or actions that are prohibited and that includes - grooming, blackmail, and identifying alleged victims of CSE,"" she said. ""We've also strengthened our enforcement with more tools, and technology to prevent bad actors from distributing, searching for, or engaging with CSE content across all forms of media. If CSE content is posted on X, we remove it.""

""Now we also remove any account that engages with CSE content - whether it's real or computer generated,"" Yaccarino added.

In addition to backing a range of legislative responses, Yaccarino also plans to ask the Senate and the social media industry to focus on two areas - ensuring law enforcement has the resources needed to bring bad actors to justice and the need for collaboration because artificial intelligence (AI) will allow offenders' tactics and capabilities to evolve.

ELON MUSK SAYS AUDITS SHOW LESS ANTISEMITISM ON X THAN OTHER APPS

In a blog post on the X website last week, the company said it's ""determined to make X inhospitable for actors who seek to exploit minors"" and that, ""In 2023, we made clear that our top priority was tackling CSE online.""

The company noted that it is ""improving our detection mechanisms to find more reportable content on the platform to report to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). Plus, we are also building a Trust and Safety center of excellence in Austin, Texas, to hire more in-house agents so we can keep accelerating our impact."" X is planning to hire an additional 100 social media content moderators to work out of the Austin-based center.

X said it has developed an automated reporting system that sends reports to NCMEC's CyberTipline and has partnered with Thorn to automatically suspend, deactivate and report suspected CSE incidents to NCMEC ""in minutes without human involvement.""

SOCIAL MEDIA CEOS TO TESTIFY BEFORE SENATE ON ONLINE CHILD EXPLOITATION IN JANUARY

The company also increased training for human content operators to increase the number of manually submitted reports sent to NCMEC, which it said resulted in a tenfold increase from an average of 6,300 reports per month to an average of 64,000 reports per month from June through November 2023.

The company's safety team posted a notice informing users, ""Posting Non-Consensual Nudity (NCN) images is strictly prohibited on X and we have a zero-tolerance policy towards such content.

2024-01-31,Budweiser's Clydesdales return for Super Bowl LVIII,"Houston Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud partnered with Cheetos to launch a new flavor ahead of the Super Bowl.

Budweiser's 2024 Super Bowl appearance will mark a return to the beverage maker's roots after a turbulent 2023 mired by the company's Bud Light partnership with transgender activist Dylan Mulvaney, which alienated customers and wholesale partners.

Now, when the San Francisco 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs face off, fans will see a commercial called ""Old-School Delivery"" featuring the iconic Budweiser Clydesdales for the first time since 2022. Their labrador retriever pal will also make an appearance.

In the ad, the animals help two delivery men bring Budweiser to a bar through difficult snowy conditions, the brand said. An actual long-time Budweiser wholesaler stars as one of the men.

With this the Super Bowl spot, the Anheuser-Busch InBev-owned beer brand seeks focus on Budweiser's commitment to ""always delivering in the moments that matter,"" it said Wednesday. It also salutes its wholesalers, distributors and other workers.

Budweiser gave fans a brief preview last week of the Super LVIII ad and the well-known draught horses in it.

""Budweiser has been synonymous with the Super Bowl for decades and the broadcast continues to be a very special moment for our brand and a core pillar of our advertising strategy,"" Budweiser USA marketing head Kristina Punwani said in a Wednesday statement. ""We knew there was no better way to show Budweiser's continued commitment to delivering for its fans than with our biggest celebrities [the Clydesdales].""

The ad comes as the company tries to move on from Mulvaney, which caused customer boycotts and negatively impacted the brand's sales. Constellation Brands' Modelo Especial beat Bud Light to become the top-selling beer in America following the pushback.

In the weeks and months following, the parent company's market value took a hit and now sits at $105 billion, down from around $134 billion in March of last year.

2024-01-31,"Walmart creating 150 new stores, redesigning hundreds more","Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner shares the lessons he's learned that help him lead the company today.

The largest private employer in the U.S. is looking to expand its footprint to reach even more customers.

Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner announced Wednesday that the Arkansas-based company is looking to build 150 modernized stores over the next five years, its latest effort to reinforce its role as a community pillar. Of the 150, some will convert smaller stores into bigger ones.

It will mark the first time Walmart has opened a new store since November 2021, a spokesperson told FOX Business.

New stores will be a mix of 182,000-square-foot Walmart Supercenters that employ about 300 and 38,000-square-foot Neighborhood Markets that employ up to 95.

WALMART US CEO JOHN FURNER: HOW HE LEADS THE NATION'S LARGEST PRIVATE EMPLOYER

Walmart will hire hundreds of new employees in the communities where the new stores will be located.

""These efforts represent millions of dollars in capital investment of labor, supplies and tax revenue, which benefit their respective communities,"" Walmart CEO John Furner said in a blog post Wednesday. ""They'll help us reach and serve even more customers.""

The global retail behemoth, by all accounts, already has immense reach.

WALMART BOOST IN COMPENSATION FOR SUPERSTORE MANAGERS COULD REACH $400,000

In the U.S., the company operates just over 4,600 stores and employs about 1.6 million associates. That does not include the 599 Sam's Club membership warehouses it also operates in the U.S.

With its footprint, the company estimates there is a Walmart store within 10 miles of 90% of Americans. This latest push will expand that reach.

To kick off the new year, two of Walmart's Neighborhood Markets are already slated to open later this spring in Santa Rosa Beach, Florida, and Atlanta.

It's also finalizing construction plans for 12 other new projects that are expected to start in 2024. It is also converting one of its smaller locations to a Walmart Supercenter.

Walmart will also remodel 650 existing stores across the nation through February 2025.

The newly constructed and remodeled stores will boast the company's new store concept with improved layouts, bigger product selection and new technology that will help associates with customer support.

The stores have refreshed signs, paint, shopping carts and a new checkout design.

There are also interactive displays in certain areas of the stores and massive merchandise on display so customers can get a better look at products.

Billionaire Ken Griffin announced Tuesday that he would stop giving money to Harvard University, calling current students ""whiny snowflakes"" who are more focused on politics than on traditional education.

""Until Harvard makes it very clear that they're going to resume their role as [educators of] young American men and women to be leaders, to be problem solvers, to take on difficult issues, I am not interested in supporting the institution,"" Griffin told CNBC's Leslie Picker during the MFA Network Miami conference, according to CNN.

""Will America's elite universities get back to the roots of educating American children -- young adults -- to be the future leaders of our country or are they going to maintain being lost in the wilderness of microaggressions and a DEI agenda that has no real endgame,"" he said.

Griffin, who has a net worth of over $37 billion, according to Forbes, is one of the richest people in the world and is a graduate of Harvard. In total, he has donated over ""$500 million"" to his alma mater, CNN reported, including a $150 million donation that ""Harvard said holds the record for the 'largest single gift to undergraduate financial aid and to Harvard College.'""

Griffin gave $300 million to Harvard in April, after which the university announced that it would rename the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences after the billionaire in his honor.

Harvard has lost the support of multiple major donors as accusations against the university of allowing antisemitism to fester on campus have continued to build.

In December, billionaire Len Blavatnik paused donations to Harvard University over its handling of ex-Harvard President Claudine Gay's controversial appearance before Congress.

2024-01-31,Home prices in some cities trended down in November: Case-Shiller,"Home prices edged toward a more affordable place in November, ending the upward trend after many months, according to the latest S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices report.

The report is a measure of U.S. home prices across major metro areas. Across the country,12 out of 20 markets saw a month-over-month decrease in home prices. The 10-city composite decreased by 0.1% month-by-month, while the 20-city composite decreased by 0.2%.

""U.S. home prices edged downward from their all-time high in November,"" Brian D. Luke, the head of commodities, real and digital assets at S&P DJI, said. ""The streak of nine monthly gains ended in November, setting the index back to levels last seen over the summer months.""

While this decline may signal a more affordable market for homebuyers in the future, year-over-year prices haven't lowered. The 10-city composite rose by 6.2% annually and the 20-city composite increased by 5.4%.

San Diego, CA saw the next largest price hike, with an 8% average increase. On the other end of the spectrum, Portland prices fell by 0.7%. It's the only city that reported lowering prices in November 2023 versus November 2022.

""The Northeast and Midwest recorded the largest gains with returns of 6.4% and 6.3%, respectively,"" the Case-Shiller indices reported.

HOME BUYERS STRUGGLE IN 2023, BUT HOMEOWNERSHIP RATE COULD RISE IN 2024

Some cities saw slight declines in home prices in November, but prices are generally likely to continue rising as the market picks up.

In 2023, about 668,000 new homes were sold, Census Bureau data showed. That's an increase of 4.2% from the 641,000 homes sold in 2022.

""Home price growth continued to accelerate through the winter and registered solid monthly gains despite mortgage rate surge before the Fed December meeting which weighed heavily on already existing affordability challenges,"" said Dr. Selma Hepp, chief economist at CoreLogic.

""With mortgage rates now lower and spring home buying demand already lurking, home prices will continue to rise, especially considering the outsized pent-up demand for homes coming from young buyers, those who have been waiting for lower rates, and huge influx of immigrants over the last couple of years.""

Demand for homes declined the last few months as interest rates rose, but in November, home sales rose by 0.8%, according to Realtor.com data. With mortgage interest rates heading toward the lower 6% range, demand for homes is likely to increase in 2024.

2024-01-31,United exec says COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to Boeing's problems,"Aviation expert Peter Lemme discusses reports an Alaska Airlines plane was missing some bolts when it left a Boeing factory on 'The Evening Edit.'

A top United Airlines executive suggested the loss of experienced personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic is to blame for Boeing's recent string of problems.

United Airlines Executive Vice President Finance Gerry Laderman made the observation at the Airline Economics conference in Dublin, Reuters reported.

""Experience counts, and they need to have a good experienced team righting the ship,"" Laderman said.

""Part of the problem for lots of industrial companies is nobody realized the difficulties that we were all going to get hit with as we came out of COVID,"" he continued.

ALASKA AIRLINES PLANE MAY HAVE LEFT BOEING FACTORY WITHOUT BOLTS TO SECURE DOOR PLUG: REPORT

""Principally the supply chain but also a lack of senior people and a lot of retirements: the knowledge base. That impacts everybody, and I think that is part of what happened at Boeing and ... it will take time.""

Laderman said he would not comment on whether there should be management changes at the airplane manufacturer, according to Reuters.

Boeing has faced setbacks since a door plug on a 737 MAX 9 plane operated by Alaska Airlines blew off mid-flight earlier this month, which prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to ground all 737 MAX 9 planes pending a safety investigation.

The apparent cause of the accident may have been missing bolts meant to secure the door plug in place when the aircraft left Boeing's factory, the Wall Street Journal reported.

BOEING PRESIDENT SPEAKS OUT AS ALASKA AIRLINES RESUMES 737 MAX 9 SERVICE

Since the incident, lawmakers have pressured Boeing to withdraw a request for a key safety exemption that could have allowed regulators to speed up certification of its forthcoming 737 MAX 7 plane. Boeing said it would do so on Monday.

The ongoing Airline Economics conference this week is being closely watched as key airline executives -- many of whom are Boeing customers -- react to the trouble at Boeing.

Conference delegates said Boeing's decision raised questions about the timing of the larger and more widely sold MAX 10, whose certification had been expected a year after the MAX 7.

EX-AMERICAN AIRLINES CHIEF SAYS BOEING FACES 'TOUGH CHORE' TO REGAIN REPUTATION

United, a leading operator of the MAX 9, has ordered 277 of the larger MAX 10 aircraft, for which Boeing has also been expected to ask for an exemption.

CEO Scott Kirby has reportedly visited competitor Airbus to discuss the purchase of more A321neos amid the controversy with Boeing, Reuters reported.

Laderman, who is set to retire after stepping down as chief financial officer, told Reuters he doesn't keep track of Kirby's travel anymore. He did note that AIrbus has also had delivery problems, with the A321neo in strong demand but low supply.

""Yes there's a Boeing issue. But keep in mind, for very different reasons, Airbus has issues too, related mostly let's say to the supply chain.""

2024-01-31,Fed likely to shed light on interest-rate cut timeline at January meeting,"BlackRock CIO of Global Fixed Income Rick Rieder says investors should buy high quality fixed income assets in the five year part of the yield curve on 'The Claman Countdown.'

After a nearly two-year battle against high inflation, the Federal Reserve may finally be on the brink of cutting interest rates.

Fed officials are widely expected to hold interest rates steady at a range of 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest level in 22 years, and make modest adjustments to their post-meeting statement that suggest policy is restrictive enough.

However, Wall Street is even more laser-focused on what Fed Chairman Jerome Powell could signal comes next for the central bank during his 2:30 p.m. ET press conference Wednesday.

""The press conference will be scrutinized for any signal on when the Fed might start cutting interest rates,"" said Gregory Daco, EY chief economist. ""While Powell will not want to signal any precise timeline on the onset of rate cuts, the timing of policy easing will surely be the main point of discussion during the two-day meeting.""

FED'S FIGHT AGAINST INFLATION IS WEIGHING ON MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICANS

Updated quarterly economic projections laid out after the Fed's December meeting show that a majority of Federal Open Market Committee officials expect rates to fall to 4.6% by the end of 2024, suggesting that there will be at least three quarter-point rate cuts next year. However, policymakers shed little light on when they expect to start reducing rates.

Traders are betting on even more aggressive rate cuts, starting as early as March, despite recent efforts by Fed policymakers to temper expectations. About 42% of investors are currently pricing in a quarter-point cut in March, while 54% expect the reductions to start in May, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, which tracks trading.

Goldman Sachs has projected five rate cuts, while Bank of America and UBS are predicting four rate cuts this year, beginning in May. Wells Fargo economists are penciling in just three reductions.

401(K) HARDSHIP WITHDRAWALS ARE SURGING AS HIGH INFLATION SQUEEZES AMERICANS

""If policymakers' sentiment is that they're likely to wait until after March to make a rate cut decision, we believe Powell will favor a more hawkish tone and promote policy optionality, especially with markets continuing to price early and rapid rate cuts starting in March,"" Daco said.

The Fed voted during meetings in September, November and December to hold interest rates steady. Officials are now trying to figure out whether they can begin unwinding policy to successfully avert a recession without reigniting inflation.

While inflation has cooled considerably in recent months, it remains up 3.4% compared with the same time a year ago, according to the most recent Labor Department data.

Policymakers have raised interest rates sharply over the past year, approving 11 rate increases in the hopes of crushing inflation and cooling the economy. In the span of just 16 months, interest rates surged from near zero to above 5%, the fastest pace of tightening since the 1980s.

Hiking federal rates tends to create higher interest rates on consumer and business loans, which then slows the economy by forcing employers to cut back on spending. Higher rates have helped push the average rate on 30-year mortgages above 7% for the first time in years.

2024-02-01,"As tax plan advances, GOP's Grassley says the quiet part loud","Democrats are claiming that GOP officials are putting party over country -- and some Republicans are effectively admitting that the accusations are true.

Those who keep an eye on Congress know that the institution is slow, bitterly divided, and seemingly incapable of advancing compromise measures. But once in a great while, lawmakers manage to defy expectations, move with surprising speed, and approve a bipartisan agreement. NBC News reported overnight:

It was just two weeks ago when Missouri Rep. Jason Smith, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, announced a breakthrough on tax policy. The former had secured an extension of Trump-era tax breaks for businesses, while the latter secured an expansion of the child tax credit.

In a written statement, Wyden explained, ""Fifteen million kids from low-income families will be better off as a result of this plan, and given today's miserable political climate, it's a big deal to have this opportunity to pass pro-family policy that helps so many kids get ahead.""

As we've discussed, this isn't as ambitious or as generous as the original Democratic policy from 2021, but this is a plan that would help millions of families.

The legislation faced some obstacles, including criticisms from the left and right, but it nevertheless cleared the lower chamber with 357 votes. It now heads to the Senate, where it will need at least 60 votes to advance.

Given the margin in the House, and the scope of the bipartisan support, that might not seem like much of a challenge, but one GOP senator summarized a core problem. NBC News also reported:

""Passing a tax bill that makes the president look good -- mailing out checks before the election -- means he could be re-elected, and then we won't extend the 2017 tax cuts,"" the Iowa Republican said.

For now, let's not dwell on the fact that there are no provisions to send out ""checks"" in the legislation, which is a basic detail that Grassley -- the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, and the former chairman of the Senate Finance Committee -- really ought to understand.

It's the other part of Grassley's answer that's especially important.

The problem is not that the Iowa Republican opposes the underlying legislation; the problem is that his principal concern is avoiding governing successes that might make President Joe Biden ""look good"" in an election year.

The longtime GOP senator could put country over party, but by his own admission, he's reluctant to do so. To hear Grassley tell it, reducing child poverty is fine, but helping the Republican Party's electoral strategies is better.

Some might be tempted to believe that both parties think this way. That's wrong. As recently as 2020, congressional Democrats put aside partisan considerations and worked to put money in Americans' pockets during a crisis -- without regard for whether it might improve Donald Trump's re-election prospects. The focus was on families' needs, not partisan tactics.

Four years later, Grassley's instincts push him in the opposite direction. He isn't even being subtle about it.

What's more, he's not alone. About a month ago, Republican Rep. Troy Nehls said he'd oppose a different bipartisan compromise for the same reason. ""Let me tell you, I'm not willing to do too damn much right now to help a Democrat and to help Joe Biden's approval rating,"" the Texan said. ""I will not help the Democrats try to improve this man's dismal approval ratings. I'm not going to do it."" Nehls echoed the same sentiment this week.

In other words, Democrats are arguing that GOP officials are deliberately refusing to solve problems because they care more about elections and partisan games -- and at least some Republicans are effectively admitting that the accusations are true.","Democrats are claiming that GOP officials are putting party over country. some Republicans are effectively admitting that the accusations are true.

2024-02-01,Opinion | Why there's not a guarantee Trump's massive legal fees hurt his 2024 campaign,"The former president reportedly spent around $50 million in donors' money on his own legal fees in 2023, a number that is likely to only go up this year.

Almost all of former President Donald Trump's time in politics has been spent facing one investigation or legal threat after another. These seemingly endless run-ins with the law aren't cheap; it costs money to retain lawyers, even when they aren't of the highest quality. Trump also hates to pay for almost anything out of his own pocket, leading him to turn instead to his campaign's donors to help foot the bill.

The result is that over the course of 2023, the Trump campaign and affiliated political action committees spent around $50 million on the legal defense of the former president and others in his orbit, The New York Times reported on Tuesday. That is a truly wild amount of spending for a campaign that wasn't doing much campaigning in the off year. Now that he's facing both what is likely to be the most expensive presidential campaign season in history and an unprecedented string of criminal trials, the question is whether Trump will be able to cover it all without negatively affecting one or the other.

In his attempt to avoid dipping into his own funds, Trump is drawing primarily on money from his Save America PAC to pay his ever-mounting legal fees. He's also spending cash from the Make America Great Again PAC, the current incarnation of his 2020 re-election committee. Those accounts were once flush with cash: In the aftermath of the 2020 election, he raised more than $200 million by selling his supporters on the lie that he was going to expose mass fraud. But since then, Trump has been indicted in four criminal cases and faced several major civil suits, leaving those accounts struggling to stay in the black as the cash on hand has dwindled.

The costs Trump faces are only going to go up as the year goes on, along with his ability to afford time off the campaign trail. His New York state civil trials have wrapped, with the E. Jean Carroll defamation verdict costing him $83 million and another judge poised to hand down millions of dollars in damages against his company. But the criminal cases still loom, with Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's hush money trial due to start in March. Trump's federal election interference case, which was scheduled to start in March, as well, is likely to be delayed as the courts continue to deal with his farkakteh immunity claim -- but those delay tactics still cost money as they continue up to the Supreme Court.

While it's true that the Trump campaign is apparently more functional than it was the last two times around, the amount of funding available will play a major part in determining whether that lasts. At the same time, though, there's not a guarantee that the steady outflow from Trump's campaign to his lawyers' pockets will be a drag on him come November. His unique position could be enough to blunt the effect that such a huge line item might have on other campaigns.

Unless former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley stays in the race longer than expected, the primary season will be over almost before it had begun. That will allow the campaign to access new donors and tap funds that could be used only in the general election. Trump is also a former incumbent, one whose policies and positions are widely known among his supporters. He has near-universal name recognition and can spend most of his time attacking President Joe Biden rather than trying to introduce himself or his plans. There's no indication, either, that his supporters are set to slow their financial support for him, even if 10 cents of every dollar they send him are being funneled to his legal defense.

We also may need to shift our perception of those legal fees' being a detraction from the campaign rather than something that complements it. Yes, it is usually an uncontroversial idea that a criminal trial (let alone multiple trials) hurts a candidate's popularity. Consider, though, that a huge part of the campaign's message centers on grievance: Trump himself is being persecuted, therefore any one of his followers could face the same treatment. What better demonstration of that than his supposed continued harassment by the ""weaponized"" legal system and law enforcement?

In political campaigning, there are two ways to spread a candidate's message: paid media and earned media. The former comprises creating and running ads on TV and radio, in print and on the internet -- most campaigns' largest expenditure. The latter is every other time candidates appear on TV or in news articles, whether it's because clips from their stump speeches are aired or, as in this case, they're appearing in court.

Trump's lawyers have become steadily less likely to focus on developing an airtight legal case than reflecting and weaving in their client's preferred narrative. His rant in the closing arguments at the civil trial in the case against his businesses was filled with campaign rhetoric despite a warning from the judge to stick to the matter at hand. His appearances outside the courts are live performances of his posts on Truth Social, the social media platform he owns and uses to post whatever nonsense is in his brain.

Trump's team is already poised to view his coming criminal trials as an extension of the campaign trail and another chance to sow misinformation. Given that frame of reference, the money being diverted away from ads will be recouped as the spotlight stays focused on him. If anything, Trump will be more prone than usual to remain on message, as horrifying a message as that is, while he's throwing unfounded accusations of corruption at Biden.

To be clear: I'm not saying that it's good that Trump will be spending vast sums of money from his donors to try to keep himself out of jail. Nor am I saying it's going to be the kind of thing that wins over that small sliver of undecideds that both camps will be fighting over.

2024-01-31,Why Trump's mysterious $48 million loan matters,"While it could be evidence of a crime, it's likely more important, for now, in the New York attorney general's civil fraud trial, where a ruling is expected any day.

As devoted Trump trial watchers know, Judge Arthur Engoron said he hoped to release his ruling by today -- Jan. 31 -- in the New York attorney general's civil fraud trial against former President Donald Trump; his adult sons, Eric and Don Jr.; multiple Trump-owned companies; and others.

And as we wait, I decided last night to take a closer look at the letter sent to Engoron by former federal Judge Barbara Jones last Friday, when I was consumed with the verdict in another Trump civil trial -- E. Jean Carroll's second defamation case.

You might remember that Jones was initially appointed as an independent monitor of the Trump Organization in late 2022, when the New York AG's office obtained a preliminary injunction in the case based on its initial showing of long-standing fraud throughout the organization's financial statements. Jones -- whose appointment was agreed to by both sides -- has served in that capacity since, and she submits semi-regular reports to Engoron.

In her most recent report, as many have noted, she not only identified a variety of irregularities but also flagged something potentially more significant: the absence of any loan agreement memorializing what she understood to be a $48 million loan to Trump from Chicago Unit Acquisition, an entity affiliated with his Chicago building. That loan, which reportedly was made in 2012, seems to have been repeatedly included among Trump's liabilities in his U.S. Office of Government Ethics-required financial disclosures in 2018, 2019, 2020 and just days before leaving office in 2021. Yet in her letter, Jones noted that in her recent discussions with the Trump Organization, the company ""indicated that it has determined that this loan never existed.""

What's more, Jones' letter implies that Trump's present-day disclosures to the Office of Government Ethics are similarly flawed. Indeed, a review of Trump's 2023 personal financial disclosure report, which he filed as a presidential candidate in April of last year, reflects the loan as an existing liability, not an extinguished one. If the loan never existed, that means that Trump -- while under a court-appointed monitorship -- was lying to the federal government and misleading the monitor.

What could this all mean? After all, Trump's team has rebutted Jones' account, insisting that executives never told Jones the loan hadn't existed and providing a recent memo -- without any identifiable author -- simply stating that the loan was no longer due or payable.

But if there never was any loan, the consequences could be significant -- though not necessarily in the way others have suggested. Yes, if Trump received $48 million but never repaid it, that should have had tax consequences. But I am far more interested in how Engoron could be influenced by the discrepancies between how Trump has reported the loan and how he has documented it.

Recall that the New York AG has asked Engoron not only to claw back $370 million in ill-gotten gains from Trump and the other defendants, but also to order a variety of injunctive relief that would prevent Trump and others from doing otherwise lawful acts. That relief includes bans, whether permanently for Trump or more temporarily for Eric and Don Jr., on their participation in the New York real estate industry and their service as directors and officers of New York companies.

In requesting said relief, the attorney general's office argued that the defendants not only have ""a demonstrated history of creating and using false financial documents,"" but also that their conduct is likely to recur without such measures. Why? Because, the AG's office argues, Trump and the others' unlawful financial conduct persisted throughout the attorney general's investigation and even after the monitor's appointment. That Jones has uncovered what could be even further evidence of fraud, as recently as last year, could be the cherry on top of the sundae that Engoron serves Trump.",Judge Arthur Engoron said he hoped to release ruling by today -- Jan. 31 -- in New York fraud trial.

2024-01-31,Could Trump successfully appeal E. Jean Carroll's $83.3 million defamation verdict?,"The Supreme Court has upended punitive damages before. Trump says he's looking for appellate lawyers.

Donald Trump said he wants to bring on new lawyers for an appeal in the E. Jean Carroll case. Whether or not any attorneys are interested in taking the case, the announcement raises the question of what might be accomplished legally by challenging the $83.3 million defamation verdict. One question is whether the punitive damages would stand, because they've been cut in previous cases.

For some guidance on this question, we can look at a 2003 Supreme Court case called State Farm v. Campbell. There, the high court said punitive damages of $145 million violated due process in part because the number was so much higher than the compensatory damages of $1 million. That's obviously a much bigger gap than in Trump's case, with $65 million in punitive damages and $18.3 million compensatory.

The court said in the State Farm case that ""few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy due process,"" adding that punitive damages of more than four times the compensatory amount ""might be close to the line of constitutional impropriety."" The punitive damages for Carroll are less than four times the compensatory amount, so that shouldn't be a problem here. Yet, the court also said that when compensatory damages are ""substantial,"" then a punitive amount equal to those damages might be more appropriate. Even if the punitive damages Trump owes were reduced in that way, he would still be on the hook for $18.3 million in punitive damages.

At any rate, the court said awards ""must be based upon the facts and circumstances of the defendant's conduct and the harm to the plaintiff."" So it would be a case-specific analysis, which might not help the former president in light of his repeated defamation of Carroll in speeches and social media posts.

Also notable in the State Farm case is that it was a divided ruling with only one of the justices on that court still on it today: Clarence Thomas. He dissented in that case, reiterating his view that the Constitution doesn't constrain the size of punitive damage awards.

Whatever Thomas and the rest of the Roberts Court would say about this case if it gets to them some day, first we'll see which lawyers, if any, take up the appeal to begin with. Given Trump's track record in court recently, the best appellate lawyers in the country may not be exactly jumping at the opportunity.","Trump says he wants to bring on new lawyers for an appeal in the E.

2024-01-31,"Opinion | Why this could be the beginning of the end for ""Dry January""","By Camper English, cocktails and spirits writer and educator

Today is the last day of Dry January, a yearly ""holiday"" celebrating temporary sobriety. In the past, this temporary experiment has paired nicely with New Year's resolutions and renewed regularity at the gym, all to be quickly forgotten come February. But for an increasing number of millennials and Gen Z, going sober isn't an annual health challenge.

Millennials like to go out, not burn out.

The Covid pandemic may have accelerated this trend, with its isolation fueling increasing rates of drinking, followed by a backlash. On Instagram, friends and influencers cheerfully evangelizing about their new sober lifestyles proliferate. This growing push for a truly inclusive nightlife scene is shifting us all toward a cultural sea change -- and perhaps the beginning of the end of America's all-or-nothing approach to alcohol. 2024 feels like an anti-tippling tipping point.

I feel like my fellow Gen Xers did not exactly set a great example. At least anecdotally, I have watched many friends maintain their party-hearty heavy-drinking lifestyles until they were forced to quit completely, either for physical health reasons, family obligations or alcohol use disorder. My newly sober friends are now absent after dark. For my generation this seems normal, but I think we can all agree it's not a great approach.

Luckily, younger generations are changing these patterns and drinking -- or not drinking -- more deliberately. Terms like ""sober curious"" and ""mindful drinking"" refer to increased awareness of the downsides of drinking and more conscious decision-making that doesn't always have to do with traditional addiction.

Books like ""We Are the Luckiest: The Surprising Magic of a Sober Life"" and ""This Naked Mind,"" along with a plethora of podcasts, blogs and social media accounts extoll the benefits of the lifestyle in often positive terms, highlighting the ways giving up or reducing drinking can improve your life -- even if your life felt OK before. Something called ""sober tourism"" features sober tour companies. Meanwhile, mocktails are popping up on everything from Michelin restaurant menus to your local bar's blackboard. Gone are the days when Dry January meant miserably sipping a seltzer in the corner.

There is a parallel here, I think. In the mid-1990s and earlier, many restaurants didn't cater to vegetarians very well. The choices for us were separate hippie veggie restaurants or ""regular"" restaurants that begrudgingly offered a cooked-from-frozen veggie burger or an extra-large iceberg salad. Today, of course, most restaurants plan for vegetarians and vegans, and often offer gluten free, dairy free and other menu options. And importantly, chefs now attempt to make these special meals of equal quality to the restaurant's regular dishes.

But that's what's still currently missing in many cocktail bars.

Despite the homemade ingredients and freshly squeezed juices and sometimes clarified, centrifuged, deconstructed drinks on menus, nonalcoholic cocktails are often still an afterthought, even at top-rated spots. This is not a recipe for future success.

I don't have statistics to back this up, but the cocktail bars I see with younger cosmopolitan customers seem to offer more and better low- and no-alcohol options. Natural wine bars (optimized for low-ABV options) seem to be thriving.

To be fair, adjusting your menu to include more mocktails has its challenges. In addition to being free from alcohol, some patrons also want their drinks to be free from sugar and calories; others want them to taste identically to existing drinks; still others wouldn't mind if they contain cannabis, caffeine or other ""functional"" elements that create a sense of relaxation or a buzz. And then there's the price point: Many, if not most, customers expect to pay less for these mocktails than they would for drinks with alcohol.

While a glut of new nonalcoholic ""spirits,"" liqueurs and aperitif/digestifs has entered the market over the past few years, frankly a lot of them are not very good -- especially the ones meant to imitate base spirits. I've sampled many zero-proof gins and nearly all taste like perfumed water with capsaicin added for spice; the whiskeys taste like caramel and that same capsaicin. Some have xanthan gum or other thickeners to increase the liquid's body, but these can register as slimy on the palate rather than weighty.

Worse yet, these new alcoholic substitutes can cost as much (or more) per bottle than the spirits they're meant to replicate. (There's a vegetarian parallel here too: faux meat burgers can cost more than the ones that come from cows.) That can make nonalcoholic cocktails less profitable on a per-drink basis.

Overcoming these obstacles is the job of each bar's lead mixologist. Part of the trend -- a very positive part -- is the way sober and nonsober friends are mingling. Millennials traveling in more mixed-consumption groups highlights a potentially key, stigma-busting breakthrough. A sober-inclusive culture will be more successful if it doesn't silo individuals and groups based on their needs and preferences. This has long been a problem for people who don't drink -- where can you go to hang out or bond with co-workers when the culture assumes that entertainment revolves around drinking?

I think the future is not about separate spaces for drunken wild times or else full, forced sobriety, but about de-emphasizing/decentralizing alcohol as the core of socializing. Coming together over art or culture or food or drinks is a list of excuses for coming together; not a list of justifications for getting tanked.

Maybe in a few years we won't be talking about Dry January at all -- because we won't need a special month for people to ""test out"" a dryer lifestyle. As better nonalcoholic options proliferate and the stigma around sobriety eases, it's certainly possible that choosing not to drink will become as common as choosing not to eat meat.","Today is the last day of Dry January, a yearly ""holiday"" celebrating temporary sobriety.

2024-01-31,Opinion | Elmo was the psychiatrist we didn't know we needed,"Elmo showed us what we as a country need: a loving, caring and listening community.Nathan Congleton / NBC via Getty file

On Monday, Elmo, ""Sesame Street's"" iconic, forever 3-year-old furry red monster, asked a simple question on X: ""Elmo is just checking in! How is everybody doing?"" The puppet was inundated with honest responses about people's daily depression, anxiety and feelings of being overwhelmed.

""Every morning, I cannot wait to go back to sleep,"" one X user posted. ""Every Monday, I cannot wait for Friday to come. Every single day and every single week for life.""

""The world is burning around us, Elmo,"" one X user wrote. ""Elmo we are tired,"" someone simply responded. ""Elmo I'm suffering from existential dread over here,"" another commented.

That's right. While there were some obvious jokes, many of the responses were honest and dire. Taken as a whole, they spoke to the mental health challenges many Americans face. Nearly 50 million Americans experience mental illness, and according to one CNN/Kaiser Family Foundation poll, 90% believe the nation itself is in a mental health crisis. By Wednesday, Elmo's post had received almost 182 million views. At times it seemed an entire internet's worth of grown adults were trauma-dumped on a puppet.

It's not surprising why.

""People are really struggling currently, between the upcoming election, state of the climate, among others, with perhaps inadequate places to release the stress,"" Shira Spiel, a licensed clinical psychologist who has a doctorate in psychology, said of the overwhelming response to Elmo's post. ""Perhaps it speaks to the desire to connect in our increasingly remote, virtual world.""

Nicole Kern, a psychologist practicing in the state of Washington, said that the Sesame Street Muppets are in a unique position to evoke the type of vulnerability required for adults to engage in honest, public discussions about mental health, one of the reasons why so many of us unloaded on a Muppet who talks solely in the third-person.

""If Sesame Street Muppets made us feel anything as children, it was safe and loved,"" Kern says, adding that a puppet like Elmo can make people feel ""less apprehensive when sharing their thoughts and feelings ... as they feel less fear of judgment or negative reactions that they may receive from a person.""

At a time of great political division, when a reported one-third of the nation's adults say they have very little confidence in the country's future, many Americans are actively craving human connection, comfort and opportunities to express a childlike vulnerability that is rarely, if ever, supported or encouraged in adulthood.

The tens of thousands of replies and quote-tweets prompted Elmo's furry friends to come to his aid -- many quote-tweeting Elmo and offering up additional love, encouragement and support. The official Sesame Street account posted that ""mental health is health"" along with a link to resources and support, and Elmo himself sent a follow-up post, writing: ""Wow! Elmo is glad he asked! Elmo learned that it is important to ask a friend how they are doing. Elmo will check in again soon, friends! Elmo loves you.""

Even President Joe Biden responded, posting on X that he knows ""how hard it is some days to sweep the clouds away and get to sunnier days.""

""Our friend Elmo is right: We have to be there for each other, offer our help to a neighbor in need, and above all else, ask for help when we need it,"" Biden continued. ""Even though it's hard, you're never alone.""

More importantly, Elmo's post and subsequent response was a palpable reminder of why those challenges are best faced together -- as a community -- rather than individually via the quintessential, unsustainable ""pull yourself up by your own bootstraps"" mentality that has plagued American culture and continues to define U.S. adulthood.

Despite undeniable strides made in normalizing mental health care, a reported 1 in 10 Americans say their family and friends ""lack understanding or compassion"" regarding their mental health and fear they'll be judged as a result. Knowing that Elmo, Oscar, Cookie Monster, Grover and the whole gang wouldn't dare judge us for our atrocious mental and emotional state gave us all permission to be earnest on main. After all, Sesame Street was built on kindness.

""A Muppet specifically elicited such an overwhelming response because Sesame Street does a great job at addressing common issues that children face, such as bullying, sharing, anger at others and loneliness,"" Spiel said. During the pandemic, Elmo and his lovable gang of puppets practically raised my two young sons while I worked remotely full time and tended to cooking, cleaning and caregiving duties.

Of the outpouring of feelings on X, Spiel said, ""People may have drawn upon their childhood feelings of being seen and heard, allowing them to tap into what they are facing today as adults.""

Elmo also evoked the power of collective storytelling, which studies have shown to be a ""beneficial way to process trauma and other negative experiences for older children and adults,"" Kern said.

""For older children and adults, we can find a lot of benefits in storytelling, especially when we have a shared trauma or similar experience,"" she added. ""This helps us to see that we are not alone, and that if other people are able to overcome these situations, we may also be able to overcome them.""

It wasn't just that a Muppet cared enough to check in on us -- it was that so many of us responded, creating an online environment that felt warm and welcoming enough to respond honestly and cloaked in the security found behind a computer screen.

Of course, it's not the responsibility of a puppet to adequately address and potentially fix the country's mental health crisis.

It's on us, the adults in the room who reverted back to the most childlike version of ourselves the moment Elmo showed us that he still cares, to push our elected officials to make mental health care more accessible. A tweet from the president is cute, to be sure, but our stress posting in a puppet's virtual direction pales in comparison to our legislators passing universal health insurance coverage that will expand access to the mental health care people want and need.

""Does it end with a collective validation where people feel heard or seen? Or do people come away from it hopeless that so many people are suffering with seemingly no resolve?"" Spiel asked. ""Venting is not always the final step of healing.""

While Elmo gave us an opportunity to express our most childlike, vulnerable and honest selves, we still must be the adults in the room. We can't wait for the next generation to address climate change, the loss of voting rights, abortion rights and LGBTQ rights. And we can't (or shouldn't) wait on a prompt from a Muppet to admit that our siloed way of living and dealing with mental health isn't working.

Elmo showed us what we need. It's the thing Sesame Street has provided children for almost 55 years: a loving, caring and listening community.","Elmo, ""Sesame Street's"" iconic furry red monster, asked: ""How is everybody doing?""

2024-01-31,MAGA legal group cites Obama-era memo to defend Trump in classified documents case,"Senior adviser Stephen Miller's right-wing America First Legal wants to put the blame on Obama for Trump thinking he could make off with the boxes.

Donald Trump's allies are playing the hits in a new key in a desperate effort to defend him from criminal charges for hoarding classified documents: Blame Obama.

Trump adviser Stephen Miller's America First Legal is making the absurd claim that an Obama-era memo could have given Trump the impression he was allowed to do whatever he wanted with classified documents belonging to the government.

AFL claimed on Tuesday to have filed a Freedom of Information Act request for a memo signed in March 2015, following a Russian cyberattack on high-level Obama administration officials the previous year. The memo established a committee known as the ""Committee for Presidential Information Technology,"" consisting of White House staff and national security officials who were tasked with offering guidance to ""maintain the President's exclusive control of the information resources and information systems provided to the President, Vice President, and Executive Office of the President.""

A rational way to read that is that this committee was meant as a security measure to advise the president and top-level officials on maintaining control of documents so that authorized people could review and share them without unauthorized people, like hackers, accessing them.

One ... other way to read the memo is that it allows the president to do literally whatever he or she wants with classified documents. Which is what Trump has argued as part of his defense in the federal case brought by special counsel Jack Smith.

And of course that's also what AFL is going with.

Although the federal indictment states that ""Trump was not authorized to possess or retain [the] classified documents"" after he left the White House and the feds asked for them back, AFL says the Obama-era memo ""may have created a reasonable belief in President Trump that he, in fact, had such authority."" This, they argue, ""is consistent with America First Legal's whitepaper contending that the President of the United States has absolute authority over presidential papers.""

The group also argues that other counts in the indictment may be ""baseless"" if it can be proven that the documents Trump refused to hand over are still preserved on digital systems used by the Committee for Presidential Information Technology.

Essentially, they're trying to spin the ""exclusive control"" phrase in the Obama memo into a legal basis to support Trump's belief that he had ""absolute authority"" over White House documents.

To call this argument a ""Hail Mary"" doesn't do justice to Hail Marys. This is a Hail Mary thrown from the 1-yard line, with your eyes closed, off your back foot, into triple coverage.

Because although Miller's group may think it's found Trump a ""get-out of jail free"" card, here's what the Obama memo does not say: It doesn't say the president has absolute authority to do literally whatever he or she wants with classified documents. It also doesn't say the president can hoard such documents in his private bathrooms and ballrooms after he leaves office. And it certainly doesn't say he can spurn multiple federal demands to return those documents or, allegedly, enlist underlings to help him do so.",Trump adviser Stephen Miller's America First Legal wants to blame Obama for Trump's hoarding.

2024-01-31,Trump's legal expenses reached a 'staggering' level in 2023,"If the latest reporting is accurate, Donald Trump spent nearly $1 million per week, every week for a year, on his legal expenses -- and he used donor money.

Last August, while many Republican presidential hopefuls scrambled to raise money, Donald Trump focused on a different financial consideration.

In an item the former president published to his social media platform, the Republican wrote, ""The Lunatic Left, working closely with Crooked Joe Biden and his corrupt DOJ, is not only focusing on Election Interference, but on getting the Trump Campaign to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, thereby having less to spend on ads....""

Much of the missive was nonsense, though the former president's reference to spending ""vast amounts"" on his legal defense raised an obvious question: Just how brutal are Trump's legal bills?

Five months later, an answer has come into focus. The New York Times reported:

The Times' report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, described the total as ""a staggering sum,"" which was more than fair. If the figures are accurate, we're talking about a presidential candidate who spent nearly $1 million per week, every week for a year, on his legal expenses.

Ordinarily, when campaign contributors make donations, they assume that their money will go toward advertising, campaign staff, campaign offices, etc. When Trump's followers send the him money, however, a dramatic amount of donors' money is redirected to the former president's defense counsel.

The details of his political operation's finances will come into focus in the latest Federal Election Commission filings -- the deadline is roughly 11 hours away -- but as the Times' report explained, the emerging picture will only tell part of a larger story.

After Trump's defeat in 2020, his followers sent millions to his Save America political action committee, hoping the money would go toward overturning the election results, as the Republican bombarded his base with brazen lies. (It didn't.)

When the former president's legal fees took a severe toll on Save America's finances, the PAC did something weird: It asked an allied super PAC, Make America Great Again Inc., to give $60 million back, in order to ease the once-flush Save America operation's financial strains. (The money was supposed to go toward primary-season advertising. Much of the money went to Trump's lawyers instead.)

What's more, as we discussed several months ago, when the former president kicked off his comeback bid, 99 cents of every dollar raised online went to his 2024 campaign, while one penny went to the Save America PAC. Early last year, however, Team Trump tweaked the ratio: Instead of one penny from every dollar going to the PAC that finances his legal defense, it was 10 cents.

With this in mind, the Times' latest report added:

It's worth noting for context that during Trump's White House tenure, as the then-president faced growing legal bills, the Republican National Committee agreed to help pay his legal bills. After Trump left office, the RNC continued to help pay Trump's legal bills.

But because the RNC tried, at least initially, to be neutral in the party's presidential nominating contest, Trump was forced to find someone else to pay his legal bills -- so he appears to have put the onus on his donors.

Of course, the likely Republican nominee could pay his own legal bills -- he claims to be an exceedingly wealthy man -- but as the Times' article added, Trump ""has long been loath to pay lawyers himself and has a history of stiffing those who represent him.""

In theory, these revelations might discourage contributors from opening their wallets to the former president, though (a) they're unlikely to hear about any of this; and (b) given the fealty Trump enjoys from his core followers, it might not sway them even if they did know the truth.","Donald Trump spent nearly $1 million per week, every week for a year, on his legal expenses. john avlon: The Times' report described the total as ""a staggering sum"" he says the revelations might discourage contributors from opening their wallets to the former president.","[('expenses', 0.3342), ('million', 0.306), ('trump', 0.3059), ('donald', 0.2895), ('total', 0.1972), ('sum', 0.1775), ('legal', 0.1559), ('president', 0.1476), ('week', 0.1456), ('spent', 0.1291)]","expenses, million, trump, donald, total, sum, legal, president, week, spent",-1
2024-01-31,Trump's disqualification wouldn't violate the First Amendment,"Ahead of the historic Supreme Court argument, constitutional scholars explain that the First and 14th amendments ""work together in harmony to protect democracy.""

Among the arguments against barring Donald Trump from running for president again is that it would violate his First Amendment rights. But top scholars of that amendment explain that its free speech protections and the 14th Amendment's insurrectionist ban ""work together in harmony to protect democracy.""

A new amicus brief joined filings from historians, conservatives and others bolstering the legal case for upholding the Colorado Supreme Court's ruling against Trump last month. He can file a final reply brief by Feb. 5 ahead of the historic Feb. 8 oral argument in Washington. The justices' forthcoming ruling could settle Trump's eligibility nationwide as cases proceed across the country ahead of the 2024 election.

The constitutional scholars recall that, under the Supreme Court's 1969 decision in Brandenburg v. Ohio, the First Amendment doesn't protect speech that's both ""directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action"" and ""likely to incite or produce such action."" That precedent and the disqualification clause in Section 3 of the 14th Amendment ""are easily harmonized,"" the experts write to the justices, ""because both require a searching review of the full context surrounding Trump's Jan. 6 speech.""

2024-01-31,Opinion | Dear Tim Cook: You are failing victims of child sexual abuse material like me,"By Leah Juliett, activist, poet and survivor of childhood sexual violence

If you Google my name, the phrase ""revenge porn"" is bound to pop up. Go ahead and do it, I'll wait. There's a good reason for this association: I led a protest march across the Brooklyn Bridge called ""March Against Revenge Porn,"" and just a few years ago, I spoke at a TEDx event about my journey from victim to activist.

But today, I'd never use those words to describe my experience. I'm not a victim of ""revenge porn"" -- I'm the victim of child sexual abuse material, or CSAM, and image-based sexual violence, or IBSV.

And these distinctions matter. Using the correct terms is crucial in raising awareness of a problem that is still traumatizing thousands, and to getting lawmakers and tech companies to take action. Pornography is produced between two consenting adults and has nothing in common with CSAM, which depicts sexualization, rape, and assault of children and teenagers.

As I've come to understand how to accurately categorize my abuse, I've also learned more about the broader landscape of CSAM. It's not an exaggeration to describe this as an epidemic of harm that is shattering childhoods worldwide. In 2022, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's CyberTipline received 32 million reports of CSAM. The vast majority of those reports were submitted by Google, WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and Omegle. (Omegle shut down in 2023.) In 2023, NCMEC says it received a record 36 million reports.

Missing from this list is Apple, and its nearly entirely unregulated iCloud.

In 2022, while other large tech companies reported and worked to remove millions of CSAM, Apple reported just 234 pieces of content. That's because, unlike many of its competitors, the company refuses to voluntarily monitor for and flag when such content is uploaded. Reporting indicates that Apple's disclosures are merely the tip of an iceberg of abuse happening under the surface.

When I was a teenager, nude photos of me were shared on the internet, many of which were shared on iPhones and, given their proliferation, likely stored on iCloud.

To this day, many of these photos remain online.

Like many survivors, I live with complex post-traumatic stress disorder from compounded childhood trauma -- trauma that was exacerbated by the public shaming that I endured after identifying as a survivor.

In 2021, I felt hopeful when Apple announced that it was taking action to flag and remove child sexual abuse material from iCloud. Maybe this would mean my images would no longer be circulated, I remember thinking. Maybe this would be the end of the abuse that I suffered at the hands of the boys who first exploited me and the adults who found -- and continue to find -- sexual gratification in images of my childhood body.

But the company was criticized by privacy advocates and others. Thousands of people signed a petition against the moves. Unfortunately, rather than finding a way to address these concerns -- while still monitoring for child abuse -- the company simply abandoned its proposal.

In September 2023, Erik Neuenschwander, Apple's director of user privacy and child safety, sent a letter to child safety activists attempting to explain the company's actions, and claiming there was no practical way to search iCloud photos for CSAM without ""imperiling the security and privacy of our users."" The result could be a ""slippery slope,"" he wrote. ""Scanning for one type of content, for instance, opens the door for bulk surveillance and could create a desire to search other encrypted messaging system,"" he continued, while calling child sexual abuse material ""abhorrent.""

But I know tech companies can do better.

I recently traveled to Washington, D.C., with other child sexual violence survivors and advocates to urge lawmakers to hold companies accountable for the role they play in the dissemination of CSAM. I was gratified by the positive response from legislators -- and I'm hopeful that they will help us change a system that is enabling further victimization.

This is especially urgent as the leaders of five major tech companies testify in front of the Senate today about child safety on their platforms. I will be in attendance as a reminder of the human cost of negligence. Although Apple CEO Tim Cook was not asked to testify, this is a necessary step. Without action, companies risk complicity.

And Apple is one of many incredibly influential companies that have the power to prevent generations of users from experiencing the same trauma that I endured.

When I was a teenager, technology did not exist to protect me. Today, that technology exists -- and it's time we put it to use. Not just for me, but for young people everywhere whose bodies have been stolen from them, and stored out of reach.","Leah Juliett: I'm not a victim of ""revenge porn,"" but of image-based sexual violence.

2024-01-31,John Bolton isn't done warning voters about threat Trump poses,"What makes the 2024 race unique: The Republican candidate's opponents and many of the Republican candidate's former aides are saying the exact same things.

Here's a little challenge for readers: I'll give you a quote, and you guess who said it.

""A mountain of facts demonstrates that Trump is unfit to be president,"" this person said. ""If his first four years were bad, a second four will be worse.""

If you're thinking the quote came from President Joe Biden or a congressional Democrat, that would certainly make sense. In fact, leading Democratic officials have certainly made plenty of assessments like these about Donald Trump of late.

But the quote actually came from John Bolton -- who served as Trump's White House national security advisor for a year and a half. The paperback version of the notorious foreign policy hawk's book is out this week, and as Axios noted, it includes fresh criticisms of Bolton's former boss.

In the new foreword to his book, Bolton reportedly warns that Trump would likely abandon the NATO alliance, use the levers of power to retaliate against his perceived political foes, and trigger a constitutional crisis.

Bolton also sat down with CNN's Kaitlan Collins and said Trump's candidacy is welcomed by Russia, China, and North Korea, whose leaders see Trump as a ""fool"" and an ""easy mark.""

""They're fully prepared to take advantage of him,"" he added. ""Trump's self-absorption makes it impossible for him to understand that.""

Bolton's comments come just three weeks after former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who also worked for the former president for a year and a half, told a national television audience that Trump is ""a threat to democracy, democracy as we know it, our institutions, our political culture, all those things that make America great and have defined us.""

Last year, Trump's former Pentagon chief also told the public that he believes Trump is a threat to our national security.

Republicans like Bolton and Esper aren't just random observers. Trump tapped both of these men for incredibly powerful positions. They worked side by side with the GOP's presumptive nominee, giving them front-row seats on how Trump thinks, listens, processes information, evaluates evidence, and makes decisions.

And now they're practically begging voters to see the former president as unfit for office.

If Bolton and Esper were alone, this might be easier to dismiss, but as regular readers know, the likely GOP nominee has faced condemnations from an amazing number of officials from his own team. The list includes several former members of the White House Cabinet -- former White House chief of staff John Kelly can barely contain his visceral contempt for the former president -- and it grows much longer if we include other officials who worked with Trump just below the Cabinet level.

History offers plenty of examples of presidents who've clashed with one aide or another, but we've never seen anything like this.

Indeed, one of the things that make the 2024 race unique is an unprecedented dynamic: The Republican candidate's opponents and many of the Republican candidate's former aides are saying the exact same things.","John Bolton served as Trump's White House national security advisor for a year and a half.

2024-01-31,James Comer's latest anti-Biden flop adds to Republican's troubles,"Over the course of the last year, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer has earned an unfortunate reputation. The Kentucky Republican has launched a desperate crusade, searching for evidence he and his party could use to impeach President Joe Biden, though observers from both parties have noticed that the congressman has failed spectacularly.

But it would be overstating matters to say the GOP congressman hasn't accomplished anything. It might not have been his intended goal, but Comer has actually excelled when it comes to calling witnesses who've discredited Republicans' conspiracy theories. The New Republic took note of the Oversight Committee chair's latest flop.

I spoke to a source with direct knowledge of Schwerin's transcribed interview who confirmed that the witness said President Biden was not involved in, did not profit from, and took no official actions in relation to his family's business dealings.

The same source confirmed that Schwerin specifically told the committee, ""I am not aware of any financial transactions or compensation that Vice President Biden received related to business conducted by any of his family members or their associates nor any involvement by him in their businesses. None.""

Hunter Biden's longtime business partner went on to say, ""In my discussions with [Joe Biden] concerning his personal finances, he was always crystal clear that he wanted to take the most transparent and ethical approach consistent with both the spirit and the letter of the law. Given my awareness of his finances and the explicit directions he gave to his financial advisers, the allegation that he would engage in any improper conduct to benefit himself or his family is preposterous to me.""

The source with direct knowledge of Schwerin's transcribed interview added that the witness, as part of his testimony, also told the committee and its investigators that he never received any political favors for assisting Joe Biden with his household finances; he never witnessed Joe Biden take any official action to advance Hunter Biden's business ventures; and he never witnessed Hunter Biden ask Joe Biden to advance his private business ventures through official actions.

For good measure, Schwerin also testified that GOP conspiracy theories about Ukraine and Burisma are also untrue.

After the hearing, Comer sat down with Fox News' Sean Hannity and complained that his panel keeps hearing from witnesses who have ""had a hard time remembering the bad things.""

It seemed like a curious way for the Republican congressman to effectively concede, ""We haven't found anything.""

Indeed, just days before Schwerin failed to tell Comer what he hoped to hear, Rob Walker sat down for a deposition and also made clear that GOP conspiracy theories are wrong. Before that, it was Mervyn Yan who disappointed Republican investigators with answers that undercut their partisan goals.

And that's just from the last week. Before Schwerin, Walker, and Yan, the list of witnesses includes Georges Berges, Carol Cox, Kevin Morris, and of course, Devon Archer. What do they all have in common? They were brought in to answer Republicans' questions about the Bidens, and they provided testimony -- under oath -- that left little doubt that the GOP's crusade is without a factual foundation.

The result is an investigation that even other Republicans have described as ""clueless,"" a ""disaster,"" and a ""parade of embarrassments.""",House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer has failed spectacularly. john avlon: Comer's latest flop is calling witnesses who've discredited GOP conspiracy theories.

2024-01-31,Trump allies make flawed case against Tim Scott joining the ticket,"After Jan. 6, Sen. Tim Scott voted to certify the election results. For people close to Donald Trump, this should keep him off the GOP's 2024 ticket.

Sen. Tim Scott's presidential campaign struggled mightily for months, in part because the South Carolina Republican seemed completely uninterested in trying to differentiate himself from Donald Trump. It led to ample speculation about the senator's motivations: Perhaps, observers said, Scott was positioning himself for vice presidential consideration.

In the wake of his national candidacy, the GOP lawmaker has gone to even more outlandish lengths to stay in the former president's good graces, to the point that Scott appeared to be humiliating himself in the hopes of impressing Trump.

A report in Time magazine this week helped highlight the context -- and the hurdle standing in the South Carolinian's way.

Yes, just hours after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, the Senate voted to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election. Of the chamber's 100 members, only eight far-right Republicans voted against certification -- and Tim Scott wasn't one of them.

What's more, during a presidential primary debate five months ago, the senator said then-Vice President Mike Pence ""absolutely"" did the right thing on Jan. 6.

As a result, as the report in Time magazine added, some of Trump's ""staunchest allies are mobilizing against Scott."" A source close to the former president was quoted saying, ""Trump wants loyalty.""

Of course, the insider didn't mean loyalty to the rule of law or our constitutional system of government; they meant loyalty that would put Trump above any other considerations.

That's a dramatic thing to see: A prominent senator is likely to be excluded from vice presidential consideration because he's not quite hostile enough to democracy.

Time will tell who else is likely to be considered the Trump-led ticket, but New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem appear to be in the mix. As this relates to Jan. 6, Noem was no longer in Congress after the 2020 election, Vance hadn't yet been elected, and Stefanik voted with her far-right colleagues against certification.","Sen.

2024-01-31,"Pompeo, Trump embrace curious definition of 'peaceful' transition","Mike Pompeo expects Americans to believe there was ""a peaceful transition of power"" in 2021. Those who were conscious at the time ought to know better.

About a month ago, shortly before Christmas, Donald Trump sat down with conservative media host Hugh Hewitt, and as part of the interview, Hewitt asked a question that most presidential candidates -- at least in the United States -- have never been asked to consider.

""If you are re-elected, will you peacefully surrender power at the end of your second term as required by the Constitution?"" the host asked, effectively inquiring as to whether Trump intended to ignore the 25th Amendment and seek a third term.

""Of course,"" the former president replied, quickly adding, ""And I did that this time."" As part of the same answer, the Republican repeated his usual lies about the 2020 race being ""rigged,"" before again saying that he peacefully surrendered power following his defeat.

The rhetoric was plainly false. Trump rejected the idea of a peaceful transition of power, choosing instead to summon a mob of radicals, whom he deployed to violently attack his own country's Capitol as part of a bid to claim illegitimate power.

But as it turns out, the GOP's presumptive 2024 nominee isn't the only one who has a flawed memory when it comes to the events of January 2021. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo returned to Capitol Hill yesterday and testified before the House Select Committee on China. As part of the proceedings, Democratic Rep. Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts tried to get the Kansas Republican to say that President Joe Biden was elected fair and square in 2020.

Pompeo refused to answer directly, eventually saying he wished Hillary Clinton ""would be so clear about her election as well."" (To the extent that reality still has any meaning, Clinton conceded defeat, called Trump on the night of the election to congratulate him, and attended his inauguration.)

But as Politico noted, that's not all Pompeo said.

Auchincloss, understandably incredulous, said, ""Let's see a show of hands: Who here thinks it was peaceful on Jan. 6, 2021?""

As the Republican Party rewrites the history of what transpired after Trump's defeat, Americans are apparently supposed to believe there was, as Pompeo claimed, ""a peaceful transition of power.""

2024-01-31,MAGA Republicans rage at Ronna McDaniel over RNC failures,"Infighting and funding woes are causing chaos in the Republican National Committee.

Ever since Republicans failed to produce a ""red wave"" of victories during the 2022 elections, some conservatives within the party have had their knives out for RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel. Challenges, like those from conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell and right-wing lawyer Harmeet Dhillon, have included allegations that McDaniel and RNC leaders misused funds for personal luxuries and failed to invest the group's resources properly (one example they cited was that the RNC pays the chair's rent; that's an arrangement, however, that former Chair Reince Priebus told Yahoo News is ""normal and routine""). McDaniel told The Washington Post in November that fundraising is low because ""there's more donors just fully committed to their candidate right now.""

Although the earlier MAGA mutiny was quashed after McDaniel was re-elected to a fourth term last year, it's having a resurgence this week.

Last Friday, right-wing outlet The Washington Times published a story, citing anonymous sources, saying the RNC had taken out a line of credit as the 2024 presidential campaign heats up. Politico also reports this week that the RNC's ""executive committee this month authorized the potential use of the credit, though a spokesperson said the RNC approves lines of credit as an annual precautionary measure.""

The timing of the Washington Times story sure was curious, just ahead of a conference hosted in Las Vegas this week by the political arm of the far-right, Trump-loving organization Turning Point USA. The ""Restoring National Confidence"" (or R.N.C.) summit was promoted as an opportunity to ""hold the RNC accountable"" and ""show the RNC how to effectively lead."" Charlie Kirk, one of the founders of Turning Point, was among those who opposed McDaniel's re-election in 2023, and his group's conference seemed to have a similar goal of making her life difficult. It certainly platformed people, like Lindell and Trump adviser Steve Bannon, who have been deeply critical of her.

McDaniel even theorized back in 2022 that Kirk and Turning Point want to ""take over the RNC."" By the look of things, it's hard to disagree.

But this week, the MAGA movement's pressure on McDaniel hasn't been confined to Kirk's conference. On Monday, the Trump-linked failed House candidate Laura Loomer claimed that a ""grass-roots ambush"" would meet McDaniel at the RNC's winter meeting on Tuesday (also in Las Vegas) to accuse the organization's leadership of financial irresponsibility.

Loomer is a conspiracy theorist and self-described Islamophobe, so take her statements with a grain of salt. But she does seem to be part of a growing chorus of criticism that McDaniel is facing -- the MAGA mutiny lives on, evidently. That's not ideal for a political party under any circumstance, and certainly not in an election year.","Republicans failed to produce a ""red wave"" of victories during the 2022 elections. some conservatives within the party have had their knives out for RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel.

2024-01-31,Why it matters that the GOP is advancing Mayorkas' impeachment,"House Republicans took a big step toward impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and the scope of the abuse should matter to voters.

It was roughly 24 hours ago when the House Homeland Security Committee prepared to vote on a resolution to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and members knew it would likely take a while. Not only would there be a spirited debate over the merits of the endeavor, but Democrats had more than a few amendments they were eager to vote on.

Roughly eight hours later, Rep. Mark Green, the chair of the panel, said members would take a dinner break. ""We want to give you guys an opportunity to go get fed and be ready because I think it's going to be a long evening,"" the Tennessee Republican said.

It was, by some measures, the only thing Green said during the proceedings that proved entirely accurate. Around 1 a.m., the committee wrapped up its work on the resolution, and as The New York Times reported, the outcome was not unexpected.

This is a story with a variety of moving parts, so some Q&A is probably in order.

What's next for the impeachment resolution? Now that the Homeland Security Committee has approved the articles of impeachment, the measure will go to the House floor for a vote.

When will the vote happen? GOP leaders haven't yet laid out a specific timeline, but most expect to see a vote next week.

Will the House actually impeach Mayorkas? Given the incredibly narrow Republican majority in the chamber, the party can only lose a handful of votes, and there are a few GOP skeptics. In fact, during a related effort in November, eight GOP members balked, and if even half of them remain opposed, the resolution will fail.

That said, Republican Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska -- ostensibly one of his conference's less radical members -- announced his support for the impeachment resolution this week, which makes its success a bit more likely.

Are any Democrats on board with this scheme? Apparently not.

Do Republicans have evidence of the DHS secretary committing high crimes? No. The party is accusing him of failing to uphold immigration laws to Republicans' satisfaction, but GOP lawmakers haven't uncovered any evidence of high crimes or corruption.

Have Republicans presented a credible case? No. A variety of constitutional experts from the left, right, and center have slammed the effort, arguing that Republicans have failed to make their case and proceeding anyway is risks doing dangerous harm. Even Jonathan Turley -- ordinarily, a reliable ally for congressional Republicans -- told GOP lawmakers they would be ""wise to avoid"" such a radical course. The editorial board of The Wall Street Journal, which also tends to be aligned with GOP politics, has now also denounced the effort.

Making matters worse, part of the case against Mayorkas attempts to hold him responsible for actions taken by an entirely different cabinet secretary.

Isn't this all a bit unusual? Very. The only time in American history that a cabinet secretary was impeached was in 1876, when the House impeached Secretary of War William Belknap -- after he left office -- over alleged bribes. (He was later acquitted by senators.)

What happens if the resolution fails next week? In theory, GOP members could try again later in the year, but if the party tries and fails to impeach Mayorkas, it would likely end the Republicans' impeachment crusade for the rest of the year, and the far-right GOP majority could, at least in theory, shift its attention to the governing responsibilities Republicans have ignored.

What happens if the resolution passes next week? Mayorkas would, at that point, be impeached, and the matter would be sent to the Senate for consideration. If 67 senators voted to convict the Homeland Security secretary, he'd be removed from office, but no one seriously believes that would happen. On the contrary, even many Senate Republicans have panned the effort as pointless and unnecessary.

Why should people care? In part because the GOP's impeachment list is almost comically long, and if the Mayorkas measure advances, it's likely that House Republicans would prepare to start impeaching others, including President Joe Biden.

But it also matters that the hapless GOP majority is engaged in a dramatic abuse, which would set a precedent that would reverberate. What would happen to the future of American politics if members of Congress decide they no longer need evidence of high crimes to impeach an official they don't like?","House Republicans took a big step toward impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.

2024-01-31,Opinion | Mayorkas impeachment efforts makes clear what Republicans truly care about,"By Dan Goldman, representative for New York's 10th congressional district

This week, House Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee will complete their rushed, baseless and legally flawed impeachment ""investigation"" of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for trumped-up, never-used charges relating to the secretary's efforts to secure our southern border. The irony here, of course, is that the ones who have failed to secure the southern border are, in fact, those same Republicans, operating at the behest of Donald Trump.

As one senior congressional aide recently put it: ""It's very clear that a large group of Republicans in the Senate and the House no longer want to do border security. ... Trump wouldn't have his issue to run on. That's what's going on here: They don't want to give up that issue.""

Keep in mind, that aide who so succinctly summed up the ongoing border legislation negotiations is a Republican, not a Democrat.

Democrats, led by Mayorkas and President Joe Biden, have been working around the clock for the past two months with a bipartisan group of senators to address the issues at the border through bipartisan legislation -- which Republicans have insisted on as a condition for providing aid to our democratic allies around the world. As Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., has recognized, the border policy package that is near agreement in the Senate would include more Republican priorities than have ever been passed or would ever be achieved under a Republican administration.

In a recent closed-door meeting with his Senate Republican colleagues, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky reportedly shared ""that the party used to be united in finding a solution"" but that the politics ""have changed"" and Trump ""wants the issue [of border security] for his 2024 campaign more than an actual solution.""

This goes beyond your regular election-year political cynicism. For the entire 118th Congress, I have witnessed firsthand House Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee using security concerns at the southern border as a political cudgel without making any effort in a divided government to reach across the aisle to actually solve problems through bipartisan legislation. And make no mistake, legislation -- not executive action -- is the only way to fix our broken immigration system.

Even within its limited executive authority, the Biden administration has taken several actions to address the situation at the border by streamlining the asylum process while expediting eligibility decisions, preventing unlawful entry between ports of entry and reducing the pressure on the system by allowing people from specific countries suffering from acute humanitarian problems to gain lawful access under certain limiting conditions.

In response to these efforts, Republican attorneys general around the country sued the Biden administration to prevent the implementation of these policy changes designed to stop the unlawful entry of migrants across the southern border and stem the flow of migrants seeking asylum.

Think about that: The Republicans are working to create and perpetuate the very problems upon which they are basing their impeachment effort of Mayorkas.

In October, the Biden administration requested supplemental funding to add asylum officers to process the backlog of asylum claims, add more immigration judges to adjudicate the backlog of cases, add more immigration and law enforcement officials to keep the border orderly and secure and add advanced technology designed to prevent fentanyl and human trafficking over the border.

House Republicans flatly rejected this request.

Those of us in Congress who represent districts in New York City, among other cities around the country, are keenly aware of the immediate need to address our broken immigration system and for the federal government to reimburse cities and localities for immigration-related expenditures. That is why we Democrats applauded Biden's request to add $1.4 billion to the Shelter and Services Program, the only program within the Department of Homeland Security specifically designed for that purpose.

In New York, this support for additional federal funding for immigration is bipartisan. At a Homeland Security subcommittee hearing on Dec. 5, Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, a Republican, agreed that the federal government should provide more funding to reimburse cities and states for immigration costs.

Yet House Republicans want to eliminate that program entirely.

Republicans undermined or outright rejected every Democratic effort to address the border situation through policy and legislative fixes prior to the recent bipartisan negotiations in the Senate, which Republicans have called the best deal available in 30 years. Yet House Republicans, at the urging and direction of Trump, have declared that any border security bill passed by the Senate is dead on arrival in the House.

Democrats and Republicans agree that the situation at the border is untenable and needs reform. But it looks like only one party wants to actually address that situation: the Democratic Party.

Democrats, led by Biden and Mayorkas, have consistently tried to address the problems at the southern border and have demonstrated an unprecedented willingness to compromise with Republicans to do so.

Republicans, on the other hand, have shamelessly undermined every attempt by the administration to address the border. Worse yet, House Republicans and Trump have brazenly and shockingly asserted that they oppose any legislation because they view the chaos at the border as their best election-year issue.

To put it simply, Republicans would prefer to have chaos at the border than actually solve our border problems -- because they care more about winning elections than finding solutions for the American people.","Rep.

2024-01-31,Opinion | Fox News came close to making a good point on Taylor Swift and carbon emissions,"The superstar's private flights to watch Travis Kelce play are the source of massive carbon emissions -- but conservatives don't want to hear why that's bad.

Taylor Swift is a pop icon whose Eras Tour has been a worldwide phenomenon and a business mogul who's reportedly managed to become a billionaire off the force of her music alone. To some people her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce makes her ""couple goals."" But to certain right-wing circles on the internet, she's become a favorite punching bag, not to mention a potential psy-op from the Pentagon. (Or is it the CIA?)

Case in point: a recent article from Fox News dinging Swift for flying on her personal plane from New Jersey to Maryland on Sunday to watch Kelce (and the Chiefs) play in the AFC championship game against the Baltimore Ravens. According to a Reddit account that tracks Swift's jet and was cited in the Fox News article, that trip ""cost $1,328 for the fuel and produced three tons of CO2 emissions.""

Every so often, Fox News comes dangerously close to making a solid point before swerving at the last second to avoid it. Here, it rightly calls out celebrities disproportionately adding to carbon dioxide emissions by flying ridiculously short distances on private planes. Fox News doesn't, however, explain why carbon dioxide emissions are bad. The issue, as the network sees it, is that Swift is the one who produced them.

Carbon emissions, which have been rising since the dawn of the Industrial Age but now are mostly caused by burning fossil fuels, are the primary driver of manmade climate change. As the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased, so, too, has the average global temperature. The world recently tipped over the 1.5-degree Celsius marker that climate scientists have warned would herald an unprecedented shift in weather patterns, wildlife vulnerability and humans' ability to mitigate the effects on society. And yet the Fox News piece manages to avoid linking carbon emissions to their disastrous consequences.

In fact, the word ""climate"" appears only as part of the phrase ""climate indulgences,"" a phrase borrowed from an editorial in The Wall Street Journal referring to a bygone Catholic Church practice of allowing the wealthy to purchase indulgences that countermand any sins they may have committed. Last year, Swift purchased double the carbon credits required to offset the emissions produced from her Eras Tour travel, the excess of which would cover her trips to see Kelce play. Those carbon credits are performative, the WSJ's editorial board argued, if not downright useless:

Like Fox News, by dismissing carbon credits, The Wall Street Journal approaches a real point only to artfully dodge it. It's true that the voluntary carbon credit system hasn't had a great track record for results in actually reducing the effects of climate change. Last year, The Guardian and the nonprofit watchdog Corporate Accountability found that according to their investigation's criteria, a ""total of 39 of the top 50 emission offset projects, or 78% of them, were categorized as likely junk or worthless due to one or more fundamental failing that undermines its promised emission cuts."" The much more effective solution to slowing and reversing the effects of climate change would be to use drastically fewer fossil fuels and transition to cleaner energy sources.

But the WSJ's editorial ends by arguing that Swift is ""a brilliant entertainer and businesswoman, and her private jet flights are nothing to feel guilty about. She might take her own advice and shake off the climate criticism without the offset illusions."" The idea that there's nothing to feel guilty about in little hopscotch private flights not only is something we should all disagree with, but on top of that, the suggestion that she ought not feel bad undercuts the point of Fox News' article that cited it. Or, at least, it would undercut it if the consequences of Swift's carbon footprint were the real point Fox News wanted to make.

Fox News knows well enough that its audience, which is more likely to include major climate deniers, isn't interested in learning about climate change. So why did it even attack Swift's private plane usage? Well, because on the far right, Swift and Kelce have become a totem for progressives and Democrats writ large, prompting the sort of paranoid outbursts referenced at the beginning of this piece.

There's a new craving among conservatives for anything that shows Swift in a negative light. At the same time, there's zero appetite from those same conservatives to address climate change. The result is this kind of weirdly muddled messaging that implies that Swift has done something wrong but refuses to name the harm. Even though it's a harm that people who care about the changing climate can clearly see.",Taylor Swift's private flights to watch Travis Kelce play are the source of massive carbon emissions. a recent Fox News article dinged Swift for flying on her personal plane from New Jersey to Maryland. david frum: Fox News doesn't explain why carbon dioxide emissions are bad; it's that Swift produced them. frum says there's a new craving among conservatives for anything that shows Swift in a negative light.,"[('emissions', 0.4551), ('taylor', 0.3856), ('carbon', 0.292), ('swift', 0.2841), ('flights', 0.2749), ('dioxide', 0.2593), ('plane', 0.2365), ('flying', 0.2276), ('travis', 0.2269), ('kelce', 0.2231)]","emissions, taylor, carbon, swift, flights, dioxide, plane, flying, travis, kelce",35
2024-01-31,Opinion | GOP senators want Biden to attack Iran. They don't know what they're asking for.,"By Daniel R. DePetris, fellow at Defense Priorities and Rajan Menon, director of the grand strategy program at Defense Priorities

The attack Sunday by Iranian-backed militias against a U.S. facility in northeastern Jordan, which killed three U.S. troops and injured more than 30 more, has understandably caused shock and outrage in Washington. U.S. retaliation is assured, although we don't know what form that retaliation will take. President Joe Biden said Tuesday that he has made a decision about how to respond, and it wouldn't be a stretch to assume any U.S. military action will be broader in scope than the U.S. strikes against Iraqi and Syrian militia sites over the last three months.

Some pundits and lawmakers want Biden to include Iran itself on its list of targets. ""The only thing the Iranian regime understands is force,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., wrote in a statement after the attack in Jordan. ""Until they pay a price with their infrastructure and their personnel, the attacks on U.S. troops will continue."" Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said anything less than an attack on Iran itself would amount to cowardice on our part and embolden Iran's leaders.

Underlying all of this chest-thumping is the assumption that U.S. military action would be so painful that Iranian leaders would respond the way we would like them to: by standing down and ordering their proxies in the Middle East to cease further attacks against U.S. troops and installations in the region. Unfortunately, this is a low-probability scenario. Iran's reaction might confound our expectations. Embarrassed and angered after being struck by American bombs, Iran could up the ante and attack U.S. troops and bases. Washington's extensive military presence in the region, while commonly viewed as a source of strength, may prove to be a vulnerability by providing Iran a long menu of targets to strike.

U.S. officials are quick to say the U.S. will act ""at a time and place of its choosing."" But the U.S. doesn't have a monopoly on choosing when and where to attack. If Iran were attacked, then it, too, would most likely take time to explore its options before responding, and that response might not be immediate. It also might not be what American leaders anticipate. The roughly 45,000 U.S. troops stationed in the Middle East would have to be placed on high alert for an extended period, if only to prepare for the worst. U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria, who have already been attacked more than 160 times since mid-October, would be at the most risk.

Iran's retaliation could range from using ballistic missiles to strike U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria to stepping up its shipments of weapons to militias aligned with it. The commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East estimates that Iran possesses thousands of ballistic and cruise missiles, more than any other state in the region. At least some of those missiles can reach large U.S. bases, including Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet based in Bahrain and Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, as well as Jordan's Muwaffaq Salti Air Base.

Iran could also retaliate more discreetly and decide not to go against the U.S. in a conventional conflict it would surely lose. While Iran's conventional military power is lacking -- its air force relies on parts from the 1970s, its land forces haven't fought a war since the 1980s, its navy can't project beyond a limited area and is primarily focused on defending Iranian territorial waters from foreign attack -- Tehran's proxy network is formidable and well-suited to using asymmetric tactics against a superior adversary.

Lebanese Hezbollah, for instance, possesses about 150,000 missiles, some precision-guided, that could reach all of Israel's major cities; destroy civilian infrastructure, like airports, ports and the electricity grid; and essentially shut down the country during a full-scale conflict.

The Houthis, the militia-turned-de facto government in Yemen, have already demonstrated their resolve to fight by conducting dozens of attacks against commercial ships in the Red Sea, disrupting global supply chains and forcing large corporations like BP to stay clear. Even U.S. warships aren't immune from Houthi anti-ship missiles.

Let's set these details aside and return to the larger point. Those pressing for U.S. military action against Iran wrongly assume that Tehran would necessarily buckle under American pressure. Tehran's behavior during the last five years invalidates this belief.

When the Trump administration withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in 2018 and put maximum pressure on the Iranian economy, Iranian leaders retaliated by increasing the quality and quantity of their uranium enrichment and targeting oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. After Trump ordered the assassination of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in January 2020, Iran targeted a U.S. base in Iraq using ballistic missiles. (Miraculously, no Americans were killed.) And when Israel ratcheted up its attacks on Iranian vessels at sea, Iran mimicked Israeli tactics by going after Israeli-owned ships.

President Biden can't, of course, avoid a response to the killing of three American soldiers. But those advising him to go after Iran directly shouldn't assume they know how Iran will react. Nor should they assume that the consequences of an Iranian response can be predicted or managed.","Daniel R. DePetris: the attack by Iranian-backed militias on a U.

West Virginia is moving forward with a law that would require people to show some form of identification to verify they're 18 or older before they can access pornography online. Several states have similar laws on the books; in addition to being difficult to enforce, a federal judge recently ruled that Texas' version of the age-verification law violates the Constitution. An appeals court has allowed it to stay in effect while the case is pending.

A group of Democratic senators want the Department of Justice to stop helping local, state and tribal police buy so-called predictive policing tools until the DOJ can prove those tools won't contribute to discriminatory practices. These tools rely on a variety of data to develop algorithms that allegedly determine where future crime might occur. Studies have shown predictive policing tools disproportionately identify people of color as potential criminals.

Sen. Mark Warner is worried about a ""perfect storm"" of election interference this year. The Virginia Democrat said in an NPR interview that he wished he were more confident, citing three concerns: potential influence efforts by Russia and Iran, election deniers in the United States, and a recent court decision that bars the government from conversations with social media companies.

2024-01-30,Who's afraid of Donald Trump? Not E. Jean Carroll,"After two defamation trials, in which she won $88.3 million combined and ultimately faced down the former president from the witness stand, it's not E. Jean Carroll.

Earlier this month, in a Manhattan courtroom practically coated in gleaming wood and brass, I saw what trauma looks like in a seated position. It looks like writer and advice columnist E. Jean Carroll on the first day of her second defamation trial against former President Donald Trump: not comfortably settled in her chair, but perched on its edge, her back ruler-straight, as if she were being pulled as far away from her assaulter, who sat two rows behind her, as possible -- millimeter by millimeter.

And she never turned around, not even during breaks in the action, much less got up. In those moments, E. Jean, usually the epitome of comportment and resolve, was so petrified that she appeared positively squirrel-like.

But by the trial's last day, as one of her lawyers, Roberta Kaplan, delivered her closing argument, a different Carroll revealed herself. No longer fixing her gaze directly ahead, hands gripping the armrests, she swiveled around in her chair to enjoy Kaplan on the podium, a view that included Trump himself, until he unceremoniously walked out. And instead of looking down or away, she smiled, she was animated, she was emboldened. Once the hunted, she was now the fox.

On Monday night, just a few days after winning her second defamation trial against Trump for a combined award of $88.3 million, the fox explained that transformation to MSNBC's Rachel Maddow. Coming face-to-face with Trump for the first time in nearly 30 years was not the living nightmare she had imagined just days before the trial, when she had ""an actual breakdown,"" losing even her capacity to speak because of her fear. Rather, she told Rachel, she quickly observed that he was ""like a walrus snorting,"" adding:

In the wake of Friday's verdict, I have been asked countless times: ""How long do you think it will take E. Jean to collect all that money?"" But that misunderstands what Carroll has been fighting for since 2019 and seems to have now secured: a freedom from fear of Trump -- the freedom, at 80, to excavate and revive her witty, ""ebullient"" self, as her former boss Robbie Myers described the E. Jean she knew.

And it's that freedom that makes Carroll even more remarkable. She encased herself in armor, only to find her assaulter reduced to a naked emperor. Meanwhile, millions of Americans remain utterly enthralled -- or cowed -- by Trump. What if, like E. Jean Carroll, the rest of us saw him for what he is and always has been: someone worth our bravest fight but ""nothing"" deserving of our deepest fear?","david frum: after two defamation trials, it's not E.

2024-01-30,"Opinion | I'm a pastor headed to the southern border to challenge ""God's Army""","In response to an intensifying standoff between state officials and the federal government over border security, a group calling itself ""God's Army"" said it would lead a convoy of up to 40,000 trucks from Virginia to the southern border this week and end with a Feb. 3 rally in Eagle Pass, Texas. With its stated goal to ""Take Our Border Back,"" the convoy's organizers paint a portrait of an America besieged by dark, evil forces. God, they say, has charged Christians with halting an invasion of immigrants that is ""poisoning the blood"" of the country.

According to a Tuesday afternoon report, things haven't gone the way ""God's Army"" planned. Wired magazine reports that there were only 20 trucks in the convoy by the time it reached Jacksonville, Florida, and it remains unclear how many, if any, people in this so-called army will even make it to the border.

But the attempt to rally an army at the border must still be taken seriously, and voters of faith should see the mobilization effort for what it is: cut-and-dry Christian nationalism. As an evangelical pastor, I know it when I see it.

When organizers of the convoy say they're standing up against ""globalists'' who want to destroy America, they aren't being religious; they're being racist, not to mention antisemitic. When they say they're acting on behalf of God, they're saying that anyone who opposes them opposes God's will. Despite their attempts to give their views a religious covering, it's nothing but anti-immigrant hate they're spewing. Christianity doesn't teach turning away people in need because they don't look like you or pray like you do.

People on the extreme fringe are leading the immigration agenda right now, and because they're on the fringe, they are necessarily out of step with most Americans and out of step with the reality on the ground. Almost three years ago, a group of evangelical and Catholic faith leaders and I biked over 3,200 miles along the border. We spoke with border patrol officers, ranchers, humanitarians, faith leaders, mayors, business owners, residents and migrants, including asylum-seekers. We found that there is indeed a crisis at the border, but that crisis puts migrants, not U.S. citizens, in danger.

Despite Republican rhetoric to the contrary, the border is safe -- unless you are a migrant. The only option for entering along the southern border is to cross the Rio Grande River, climb a wall, or trek through a desert. Why do people take such risks? Because they're out of better options. Border crossing closures have increased and allotments for asylum claims have been drastically reduced.

The continuation of the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy requires nearly all asylum-seekers to await their adjudication in Mexico, which makes them vulnerable to drug cartels that prey on their desperation to cross the border or make them sitting ducks for kidnappings and other crimes. Meanwhile, the crisis continues to intensify in parts of Mexico and Central American countries.

Yet instead of loving and welcoming our neighbors, as good Christians ought, Christian nationalists are looking to pour fuel on the fire for political gain. Clearly, some Christian voters, the primary audience for this pernicious vision of America, need to be shown why Christian nationalism, and candidates like former President Donald Trump, are anathema to both Christian and democratic values. That's why our group of faith leaders is also traveling to Eagle Pass and hosting our own rally on Feb. 3.

Our plan was to present an alternative to the Christian nationalism promoted by the trucker convoy and to engage with members of the self-proclaimed Army of God. My organization, Vote Common Good, has a history of doing so. Several years ago, when the Proud Boys crashed one of our events in Florida, we later invited them to a conversation in a local bar. It's unclear if anybody from the convoy will make it to Eagle Pass, but it's still our plan to be there, and if they show up, we'll be there to talk.

Through the lens of our shared Christian faith, and with face-to-face conversations, we want to engage with people of all different political ideologies -- even those we consider extreme -- and create a dialogue that provides a path back from radicalism. We want to convey the message that Christians should support a humane immigration system that seeks to help those in need, not turn them away.

Ultimately, this weekend is one stop on a larger journey we're on this year to show voters of faith around the country that there's another way. I'm the executive director of Vote Common Good and, by our estimate, if just 3% of evangelical and Catholic voters who supported Trump previously are convinced not to do so this year, he and Christian nationalism will be defeated at the polls in November.

We're still headed to the border on the chance that there will be a standoff, but a different one than media outlets were initially predicting. The standoff we seek is one between Christians who believe God wants them to turn migrants away and those of us who believe the opposite, that God wants us all to welcome migrants with food and shelter.

This divide also exists within evangelical and Catholic communities across the country. Which group's values and vision of America wins over more voters of faith this year could make all the difference, not just on what happens at the border but on the future character of our country.","a group called ""God's Army"" said it would lead a convoy from Virginia to the southern border this week. aaron carroll: the convoy's organizers paint a portrait of an America besieged by dark, evil forces.

2024-01-30,Greene's pre-impeachment press tour sounds like a VP audition,"One thing's for certain regarding Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene: When it comes to conspiratorial impeachment pushes, she wants her credit.

The Georgia Republican's outburst toward Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., last year over who'd receive credit for trying to impeach President Joe Biden was revealing.

And now Greene is trying her damnedest to ensure she gets credit for another impeachment effort: House Republicans' baseless push to impeach Alejandro Mayorkas, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.

Given that she has been floated as one of former President Donald Trump's potential vice presidential picks, one theory of mine is that she may want to play up her successes on the impeachment front to aid her chances.

Regardless, Democrats are happy to give her all the credit she desires when it comes to this effort, as Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., demonstrated Tuesday as the House Homeland Security Committee met to discuss the impeachment articles against Mayorkas. The Mississippi Democrat name-checked Greene as being among those who have ""pushed for and even fundraised based on this preplanned, predetermined scapegoating of the secretary.""

Greene has gone on a press tour to emphasize her view that the Mayorkas impeachment push wouldn't have reached this point without her. And to talk about how the effort aligns with Trump's political plans.

After all, she has been a key voice in the House pushing the MAGA movement's claim that the immigration crisis unfolding along the U.S.-Mexico border is because Mayorkas -- and the Biden administration more broadly -- has willfully disobeyed immigration laws. And according to conservative extremists such as Greene, the impetus is that Democrats want to alter the United States' demographic makeup. (This belief aligns with the racist ""replacement theory"" espoused by many white nationalists.)

On Monday, Greene told The Hill that this week's movement forward on impeachment is ""absolutely"" the result of her efforts.

Greene essentially repeated the same thing to conservative outlet Townhall, but she added some thoughts on how Trump is responding to recent vows from House Republicans, including Speaker Mike Johnson, to block a bipartisan immigration deal that's taking shape in the Senate.

Greene and Trump have both urged Johnson to block the legislation in the House, and Greene told Townhall that she and Trump are ""very, very happy"" about Johnson ""standing strong.""

""The border is a top issue for him,"" Greene said of Trump.

If Democrats are looking for evidence that right-wing opposition to immigration reform is a political witch hunt designed to raise conservatives' political profiles and help Trump in November, they need look no further than Greene's latest remarks. Because she's not even trying to hide the crude political calculation undergirding this whole ordeal.","Rep.

2024-01-30,"Opinion | Obama had his ""Rose Garden"" re-election strategy. Biden's choosing a different path.","Given Americans' overall dissatisfaction and grumpiness, the Biden team has smartly flipped the script and taken steps to launch the general election and engage with voters early.

When I worked for Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, we favored a ""Rose Garden"" re-election strategy that embraced the grand trappings and benefits of incumbency and put off getting into the messiness of campaigning as long as possible. But given Americans' overall dissatisfaction and grumpiness, the Biden team has smartly flipped the script and taken critical steps to launch the general election and engage with voters early, especially in battleground states. Here's what you need to know.

Starting with President Joe Biden's Jan. 5 unofficial launch of the campaign in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, the president has made eight trips to five electorally critical states: three to Pennsylvania; two to South Carolina, which has a Democratic primary Saturday; and one trip each to North Carolina, Wisconsin and Virginia. He's also expected to visit the early primary states of Nevada and Michigan soon. The vice president has traveled to the same six and visited the battleground state of Georgia, too. The trips seem to be having an effect. After having trailed former President Donald Trump in 2023 polling, Biden now leads in Pennsylvania.

Biden connects best one-on-one, so he's been getting out from behind the podium to engage voters directly on these trips. In Allentown, Pennsylvania, he visited a coffee shop to talk about small business. In North Carolina, he met with a father whose student loans had been forgiven under a Biden administration program, resulting in this TikTok video, which garnered more than 10 million views. That's the kind of amplification a campaign dreams about -- and a great contrast with Trump, whom we now only see at campaign rallies or in courtrooms.","Joe Biden has made eight trips to five electorally critical states. he's also expected to visit the early primary states of Nevada and Michigan.

2024-01-30,Opinion | Nancy Pelosi's conspiracy-mongering about pro-cease-fire protests is shameful,"The California Democrat is suspicious of pro-Palestinian protests. She should think a little more carefully.

One of the most encouraging developments on the left in the last several months has been the emergence of an energetic pro-Palestinian movement calling for an end to the collective punishment of people in Gaza. But Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., sees something nefarious: a campaign aligned with Russia -- and possibly even financed by it.

During an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Pelosi said protesters' push for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas conflict helps Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""What we have to do is try to stop the suffering in Gaza ... but for them to call for a cease-fire is Mr. Putin's message,"" she said. ""Make no mistake, this is directly connected to what he would like to see.""

""I think some of these protesters are spontaneous and organic and sincere,"" Pelosi said. ""Some, I think, are connected to Russia, and I say that having looked at this for a long time now."" She also said she thought ""some financing should be investigated"" by the FBI.

This is shameful rhetoric.

It is true that we cannot rule out that Russia or any other foreign adversary is covertly seeking to amplify dissent -- or simply generate chaos on both sides -- online or through organizations that shape off-line behavior. However, there is no indication nor has any evidence been presented that protesters calling for a cease-fire are astroturfed or financed by a foreign entity, and there is an abundance of obvious reasons to believe that they're homegrown. Pelosi's call for an FBI investigation -- which hints at the possibility of repression, given the FBI's long and dark history of quashing left-wing dissent -- is an inappropriate and out-of-touch response.

Pelosi frames the idea of a cease-fire as Putin-aligned because she sees calls for a cease-fire that permits Hamas' continued existence as a strategic win for U.S. adversaries like Russia and Iran. Even if they were to cheer for a cease-fire, that's beside the point -- she should be able to find the explanation for Americans' calls for a cease-fire in her own putative worldview. She mentions concern about wanting to ""try to stop the suffering in Gaza."" Stopping the suffering is exactly what advocates for a permanent cease-fire want. And they're demanding it without the feeble rhetoric of the Biden administration and Democratic establishment, which periodically express ""concern"" about the mass civilian deaths in Gaza but appear unwilling to change any policies to pressure Israel to stop those deaths.

Organizations such as Students for Justice in Palestine, Jewish Voice for Peace and If Now Now have called for a cease-fire as a way to end mass civilian casualties and allow for diplomatic negotiations to allow for the release of hostages. This is not only the clearest and quickest path to free the hostages and end Israel's collective punishment regime in defiance of international law, but it would also help lay the foundation for a better range of strategic options. For progressive and left-wing critics of the Israeli apartheid, inside and outside of Israel, a negotiated political solution, not an ill-defined and reckless military operation, is seen as the only realistic way to disincentivize future violence against Israel.

Pelosi has little reason to be suspicious of the vociferous pro-cease-fire energy on the streets across America. A Data for Progress poll in December found that a majority of American voters favored a permanent cease-fire. Poll after poll shows that younger Americans -- who are central to the raucous energy we're seeing in demonstrations -- do not share their older counterparts' unskeptical views of Israel's treatment of Palestinians. Dozens of Democratic lawmakers support a permanent ceasefire. Even mainstream U.S. media coverage, historically uncritical of Israel and indifferent to Palestinian life, has shifted in tone toward sympathy toward Gaza as Israel's bombardment campaign and siege have killed thousands upon thousands of civilians, many of them children.

Pelosi's conspiracy-mongering and casting aspersions on protesters is embarrassing. The case for a cease-fire is self-evident. Israel, through some of its policies, is refusing to distinguish between civilians and militants, and the International Court of Justice has found that it is ""plausible"" that Israel has committed acts that violate the Genocide Convention. As opposed to suggesting that those who value Palestinian life are in league with foreign enemies, Pelosi should admit that the U.S. is betraying humanity by supporting Israel in its disgraceful conduct.",Rep.

2024-01-30,Michael Luttig warns justices against taking 'off-ramp' on Trump eligibility,"The amicus brief from the conservative former judge and others makes ""textualist"" points to a Supreme Court that claims to care about a strict reading of the law.

A new brief from conservative former federal judge J. Michael Luttig and others strengthens the growing chorus of arguments at the Supreme Court that Donald Trump is disqualified under the 14th Amendment. And it does so by wielding an interpretative method the GOP-majority high court claims to employ: textualism.

The brief focuses on two textualist points: ""First, it would violate the rule of law and textualism for this Court to create an off-ramp to avoid adjudicating whether Mr. Trump is disqualified."" And second: ""the terms of Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment disqualify Mr. Trump.""

Reminding the court of its duty, Luttig's brief debunks Trump supporters' stated concern that his disqualification ""would be weaponized against others by partisan state courts and state officials."" That's an ""anti-textual, policy argument"" that has ""no place in this Court's constitutional jurisprudence,"" goes the reasoning in the brief. In support of that proposition, it cites none other than the Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, in which the majority claimed that ""we cannot allow our decisions to be affected by extraneous influences.""

The brief also pays homage to the late arch-conservative justice Antonin Scalia, arguing that the disqualification clause shouldn't be construed narrowly. ""A narrow construction to promote judicial restraint is just as bad as an 'unreasonably . . . enlarged' construction,"" it says, citing a Scalia book.

To be sure, nothing in this brief or any others will bind the justices' decision in the case that's set for oral argument Feb. 8. And of course, the court could purport to analyze the issue through any lens to reach any result it likes. But like recent amicus briefs from historians that also support Trump's disqualification, it's a reminder that the court's own stated judicial methods should lead it to affirm the Colorado Supreme Court's ruling against Trump.","a new amicus brief strengthens arguments at the Supreme Court that Donald Trump is disqualified. it debunks Trump supporters' stated concern that his disqualification would be weaponized.

2024-01-30,"Ahead of the RNC's winter meeting, feuds take a toll on the party","Over the course of 17 days, the state Republican chairs in three battleground states either quit or were fired -- and the party's troubles don't end there.

The Republican National Committee is poised to hold its winter meeting in Las Vegas, and at first blush, one might think party leaders and activists have reason to feel cautious optimism as the election year gets underway in earnest.

But as Politico reported, it's not quite working out that way.

The report added that some Republicans in and surrounding the RNC are feeling deep frustrations ""about its finances, about its struggles to match Democrats' organizing efforts, [and] about its four-term leader."" Politico went on to note that ""many grassroots activists say McDaniel has lost their trust, perhaps permanently.""

So, perhaps things aren't going especially well for Republicans at the national level. Perhaps the party can take solace at progress at the state level?

Perhaps not.

On Jan. 7, the Republican Party of Michigan removed Kristina Karamo as state party chair after months of infighting and weak fundraising. Karamo claimed the voted didn't count, as things stand, no one seems to have any idea who the current chair is.

On Jan. 8, the Republican Party of Florida removed Christian Ziegler as state party chair after he faced allegations of rape and video voyeurism. Prosecutors later said he would not be prosecuted for rape, though they're proceeding with allegations of video voyeurism, accusing Ziegler of allegedly video recording a sexual encounter without consent.

On Jan. 24, Republican Party of Arizona Chair Jeff DeWit resigned following the release of a dubious audio recording of a conversation he apparently had with failed gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake.

In other words, over the course of just 17 days, the state Republican chairs in Arizona, Florida, and Michigan -- by most measures, three key battleground states -- either quit or were kicked out.

In case that weren't quite enough, in Oklahoma, the state Republican Party generated national headlines over the weekend when it appeared to censure Republican Sen. James Lankford for negotiating a possible bipartisan agreement on border policy. In odd twist, however, the chair of the Oklahoma GOP issued a statement claiming that the meeting at which Lankford was censured was ""illegitimate"" -- though the vice chair of the state party apparently disagrees.

All of which is to say, things could be better in Republican Party politics.",Republican National Committee is poised to hold its winter meeting in Las Vegas.

2024-01-30,How Alina Habba undermined her own push for judge's recusal in Carroll case,"The Trump lawyer highlights legal language that appears to cut against, rather than support, her argument. And E. Jean Carroll's lawyer is not amused.

With Donald Trump facing an $83.3 million defamation verdict, his lawyer Alina Habba wrote to Judge Lewis Kaplan to complain about the fact that the judge and E. Jean Carroll lawyer Roberta Kaplan (no relation) had worked at the same large law firm in the early 1990s. Habba cited a New York Post article published over the weekend that claimed Judge Kaplan had a mentor-mentee relationship with Carroll's lawyer back then.

In her own letter on Tuesday, Carroll's lawyer said that was false. Not only did they lack such a relationship, Roberta Kaplan wrote, but she has no recollection of having worked with Judge Kaplan at all during the less than two years they overlapped at the firm.

Even if they had worked together decades ago, there's no reason to think that would tank the defamation verdict. Habba suggested in her letter that Judge Kaplan should have recused himself, citing the code of conduct for federal judges. But she does a weird thing there, by highlighting language that seems to hurt, rather than help, her claim. Specifically, she emphasizes language that says a judge shall disqualify themselves from a proceeding when ""a lawyer with whom the judge previously practiced law served during such association as a lawyer concerning the matter.""

That could have been a problem if the two Kaplans had worked together when Roberta Kaplan was working on the Carroll case -- that is, per the language Habba cited, ""during such association."" But they worked at the same firm in the early 1990s and didn't work together at all, as far as Carroll's lawyer recalls; the Carroll case was brought much more recently. So the language Habba highlighted appears to show why her own claim has no merit.

If anything, Habba's effort may hurt her in the long run. Roberta Kaplan ended her letter by writing that:","Trump lawyer highlights language that seems to cut against, rather than support, her claim.

2024-01-30,Why the DOJ's subpoena to the House sergeant at arms matters,"As the Justice Department pursues a case against a House Democrat, Republican claims about a ""two-tiered"" justice system appear increasingly foolish.

As this week got underway on Capitol Hill, there weren't any major developments of note, though observers were taken aback when House Reading Clerk Susan Cole publicly informed lawmakers of something entirely unexpected.

""This is to notify you formally pursuant to Rule 8 of the rules of the House of Representatives that the office of the sergeant at arms for the House of Representatives has been served with a grand jury subpoena for documents issued by the U.S. Department of Justice,"" Cole said, reading from a written text.

What was that all about? NBC News reported that House Sergeant at Arms William McFarland received a subpoena, not because of anything he'd done, but because the Justice Department is investigating a Democratic lawmaker ""and his or her use of federal funds for a security vendor.""

Because the sergeant at arms is involved with overseeing security matters for members, it explains why McFarland's office received the subpoena from prosecutors.

Punchbowl News, citing six sources, reported that the lawmaker in question is Democratic Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri, though this detail has not been confirmed by MSNBC or NBC News.

Time will tell what, if anything, comes of the apparent criminal investigation, but in the meantime, it's worth pausing to reflect on the bigger picture.

As things currently stand, the Justice Department, under the leadership of Attorney General Merrick Garland, is:

And yet, despite these developments, one of the animating concepts in contemporary Republican politics is that rascally Democrats have ""weaponized"" federal law enforcement to punish GOP figures and shield Democrats from accountability. The Justice Department and the FBI, leading Republican voices insist, are little more than political tools for the Biden White House and its fiendish allies.

As we've discussed, Republicans don't just want their conspiracy theory to be true; they need it to be true. This simple, baseless idea is the foundation for the party's Trump defense, fundraising, stump speeches, cable-news segments, and even legislative campaigns on Capitol Hill.

In 2024, assertions about a ""two-tiered"" justice system are foundational to GOP politics. They're also routinely discredited by real-world events.

Indeed, if Biden and his team were trying to weaponize federal law enforcement to benefit Democrats, they've proven themselves to be incredibly bad at it.",House Reading Clerk: House sergeant at arms served with grand jury subpoena.

2024-01-30,The problem(s) with Trump's ugly rhetoric about the Jordan attack,"Donald Trump's ugly rhetoric about the attack in Jordan is intended to persuade people who don't remember what actually happened when he was in office.

On Sunday afternoon, Americans learned that a drone packed with explosives struck a base in northeast Jordan, near the Syria border. The attack killed three U.S. troops -- Sgt. William Jerome Rivers, Spc. Kennedy Ladon Sanders, and Spc. Breonna Alexsondria Moffett -- and left more than 30 with injuries.

Also on Sunday afternoon, Donald Trump used his social media platform to express his sympathies for the fatalities -- while blaming President Joe Biden for the actions of terrorists. From his trio of missives:

The former president added that his approach would mean ""no more chaos, no more destruction, and no more loss of precious American lives.""

Part of the problem is with the Republican's character and instincts. It's as if Trump learned the news over the weekend and effectively thought to himself, ""Three American troops were killed. How can I exploit this to advance my own interests and brag about how great I think I am?""

Basic human decency usually prevents honorable people from politicizing deadly terrorist attacks. It's a simple lesson the presumptive GOP nominee prefers not to learn.

But in terms of factual details, Trump's claim that such an attack ""never"" would've happened if he were in office, reality tells a very different story. As a New York Times report explained, ""In fact, Iran and its proxies did attack American and allied interests during Mr. Trump's presidency.""

In March 2020, for example, two American service members and a British soldier were killed in a rocket attack on a military base in Iraq, and the U.S. believed Iran-backed militia groups were most likely behind the assault. A few months earlier, a barrage of rockets killed an American contractor and wounded four American service members in Kirkuk, Iraq.

NBC News reported in September 2020, in the months that followed, militia groups -- believed to be backed by Iran -- continued to target U.S. military bases, and the frequency of those attacks increased throughout Trump's final year in the White House.

What's more, let's also not forget that in January 2020, an Iranian missile strike left several dozen of U.S. troops with traumatic brain injuries. Trump dismissed the importance of the injuries -- the Republican called them little more than ""headaches"" -- prompting Veterans of Foreign Wars to ask the then-president to apologize for minimizing what had happened to the troops.

Trump ignored the VFW's appeal.

My point is not to blame Trump for the attacks that occurred on his watch. Rather, my point is that when Trump tries to blame his own country's leaders for foreign terrorism, and says such violence would ""never"" happen if he were in office, we know this is ugly and unnecessary nonsense, intended to persuade people who don't remember what happened just four years ago.","Donald Trump's ugly rhetoric about the attack in Jordan is intended to persuade people who don't remember what actually happened when he was in office. john avlon: it's as if Trump learned the news over the weekend and effectively thought to himself, ""Three American troops were killed"" he says reality tells a very different story when Trump claims such an attack ""never"" would've happened if he were in office. he isn't to blame.","[('rhetoric', 0.3151), ('attack', 0.2811), ('trump', 0.2709), ('jordan', 0.2649), ('blame', 0.2368), ('troops', 0.2103), ('donald', 0.203), ('happened', 0.1503), ('news', 0.1493), ('isn', 0.1373)]","rhetoric, attack, trump, jordan, blame, troops, donald, happened, news, isn",18
2024-01-30,The secret behind the dramatic rise of the Stanley cup? Women.,"""At the time [we had] kind of small, fledgling Instagram account. We got a lot of positive feedback [about the cups], and noticed we were able to sell them out through our links, even though they were small amounts,"" said LeSueur, who is sisters with Cannon and cousins with Hutchinson.

The women at The Buy Guide, set out to do something about their beloved soon-to-be, phased out water bottles, which at the time retailed for $35. They said they tried contacting Stanley and were eventually connected with Lauren Solomon, who at the time was a national account manager.

They explained to Solomon just how much their followers -- who were over 90 percent women -- loved the Stanley cup for its functionality and design. LeSueur, who is a busy mom of three kids, pointed out it was perfect for women on the go; it fit neatly in her cupholder, the handle allowed her to hold many things at once, it stayed cold for days, and it was dishwasher safe. The women also sent a Stanley Quencher to influencer Emily Maynard (of ""The Bachelor""), thinking she would enjoy it as a new mom. Maynard ended up posting about the product on her Instagram stories. But at the time, the Stanley Quencher was no longer in stock, according to LeSueur.

Nonetheless, Maynard's interest in the cup caught Solomon's attention. But she thought it would be tough convincing executives at the 100-year-old brand to start marketing to women for the first time. ""I helped my colleagues understand the power of social marketing, and how female consumers drove purchase behavior -- a new consideration for the brand after years of marketing to a mostly male audience,"" said Solomon in a written statement.

""Lauren caught our vision immediately. But she was met with hesitancy and reluctance,"" LeSueur shared. ""She was our go between, and she would try to communicate to Stanley our interest in how we saw the potential of this cup. I think it's totally justified at the time Stanley's like 'And who are they? And what are they saying?' You know, they wanted to test the product, and they had no interest in changing their business strategy for that year or their manufacturing strategy for that year, because there were three Instagrammers who thought they should change it. You know, that wasn't crazy.""

As a way to test their idea, Solomon proposed the trio buy 5,000 cups wholesale and sell them on their own. The women agreed and used all the money in their business account and supplemented with personal savings towards the purchase. In five days, they sold out. They bought another 5,000 cups, and this time, sold out in less than an hour.

""Lauren really thought outside of the box and was willing to talk to and pound down any doors she needed at Stanley to find a way to get the cup into the hands that it belonged in,"" LeSueur explained.

In January of 2020, Solomon invited the women of The Buy Guide to speak to the executive team at a outdoor retail conference in Denver Colorado.

""It was the first step in their awakening to the millennial woman's purchasing power and the power that demographic could bring to their company,"" said LeSueur. According to the New York Times, the women at The Buy Guide were key in keeping the Quencher in stock.

The new idea called for a overhaul of their current marketing strategy. At the time, ""Stanley wasn't fully engaged in influencer marketing,"" Soloman explained. ""Leadership made a strategic decision to put a concerted effort behind this product, including launching the Quencher in trendy, new colors and designs, as well as partnering with influential creators and tastemakers on social media.""

Since 2019, demand for The Quencher skyrocketed. In 2021, Stanley's revenue almost doubled -thanks to sales from the cup -- from the year prior, according to CNBC. And in 2022, sales doubled again (to $402 million).

""The general population could never possibly understand what Stanley has accomplished in the last three years,"" LeSueur said. ""The way that they have completely overhauled their manufacturing, their supply chain, their distribution, their direct-to-consumer website, and their whole presence. It's been a complete overhaul to try to meet this massive demand. It's incredible.""

The success of the water bottle has gone beyond just a highly reviewed product on social media. It lives organically on Tik Tok, YouTube, and Instagram in video trends like #WaterTok, Get Ready With Me, and Day In The Life Videos -- trends dominated and watched by millennial and GenZ women offering a glimpse of their life with The Stanley Cup in hand.

Everyone from teachers, nurses, to celebrities have spoken highly about the cup, which has even made its way into middle schools, where students with ""dupes"" of The Stanley Quencher have been met with teasing.

According to LeSueur the cup isn't simply about a hydration trend among preteens, GenZ and millennials. ""They're seeing this as an accessory, as a status symbol... It's also a statement as to what I show to the world [about myself] every day when I choose to get dressed, and when I choose to take my water bottle.""","The Stanley Quencher sold out in less than an hour.

2024-01-30,GOP's Tommy Tuberville isn't done disparaging the U.S. military,"Common sense suggests Sen. Tommy Tuberville should simply stop talking about the United States military. After all, the Alabama Republican was responsible for an unprecedented 10-month blockade on armed services confirmations, which undermined his own country's military during international crises.

The same far-right senator has also reportedly failed to follow through on his commitments to veterans' charities, failed to tell the whole truth about his father's military service, and even lied about the U.S. military not being ""an equal opportunity employer.""

But while it's tempting to think the Alabaman would realize he should probably focus his energies elsewhere, Tuberville apparently can't help himself.

Last week, for example, my MSNBC colleague Ja'han Jones noted that the Republican senator used veterans to push a debunked anti-immigrant conspiracy theory. The Department of Veterans Affairs found it necessary to issue a statement setting the record straight after Tuberville helped promote the misinformation.

This week, the coach-turned-politician appeared on Fox Business and thought it'd be a good idea to complain about what he perceives as the U.S. military's ""weakness.""

To be sure, it's a free country. Senators are not required to support or respect the armed forces. If Tuberville wants to disparage the U.S. military, that's between him, his conscience, and his constituents.

But there are a few things worth keeping mind.

First, there's a degree of irony in seeing Tuberville take steps to weaken the military and then whine about how weak he thinks the military is.

Second, the idea that the armed forces have ""gone downhill"" over the last 33 years isn't supported by any evidence, and the GOP senator made no effort to substantiate his baseless rhetoric.

And finally, I can't help but remember a recent Senate Armed Services Committee hearing in which Tuberville boasted that ""there's nobody more military up here than me."" The Alabama Republican -- who has literally never spent a day serving in the armed forces -- was referring to a panel filled with actual military veterans from both parties, many of whom received honors for their service, some of whom served in combat, and some of whom suffered serious injuries while in uniform.","lz granderson: Tommy Tuberville should stop talking about the U.

2024-01-30,"GOP rep tries, fails to take credit for investments she opposed","Asked why she sought credit for spending she voted against, Maria Salazar suggested that she couldn't recall what she'd supported and what she'd opposed.

Americans tend to like investments that improve their local economies, so members of Congress tend to put a lot of effort into directing as many federal funds as possible to their states and districts. The trouble comes when Republicans celebrate -- and too often, take credit for -- investments they voted against.

The usual response from GOP lawmakers caught up in hypocrisy controversies is simple: They argue that they might've opposed the legislation, but if the federal government is going to make the investments anyway, these members figure they might as well make the case for directing some of those funds to their own constituents.

This is a flawed defense, but it's at least coherent. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, on the other hand, faced related questions, and as The New Republic noted, the Florida Republican struggled in unusually cringeworthy ways.

Jim DeFede, an investigative reporter at the CBS affiliate in Miami, noted a recent event in the area at which Salazar presented a check for $650,000 to help small businesses at Florida International University.

""You voted against the bill that gave the money that you then signed a check for and handed and had a photo op,"" DeFede explained to the congresswoman.

Salazar claimed not to remember how she voted on the legislation.

A HuffPost report added that DeFede ""pointed out that Salazar voted against the CHIPS and Science Act, but has celebrated the fact that the South Florida Climate Resilience Tech Hub is being launched in Miami. That hub was authorized by the CHIPS and Science Act. He also noted that Salazar voted against the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, but has touted all the money that law provided to Miami International Airport.""

Again, the Florida Republican, in her fourth year on Capitol Hill, could've simply said, ""While I opposed these bills, I nevertheless worked to direct these funds to worthwhile local projects."" That wouldn't necessarily have been persuasive, but it's at least what congressional hypocrites usually say.

But during her on-air appearance, Salazar instead suggested that she simply didn't know what she'd supported and what she'd opposed.

""I really cannot, I mean, right now, and I'm not trying to be a politician, there's so many bills that I've introduced that I know that many of them..."" she said, before DeFede interrupted to remind his guest that they weren't talking about bills she's introduced.

Rather, the subject at hand was bills she'd opposed, which made investments Salazar now wants credit for.

Rep. Matt Gaetz, a fellow Florida Republican, took note of his colleague's embarrassing display and wrote via social media, ""So many lawmakers in both parties are husks of humans who merely hand their vote card to the leadership. Then, stuff like this happens.""","Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar was asked why she wanted credit for spending she voted against. Rep.

2024-01-30,"As U.S. economic recovery leads the world, Trump seeks credit","Trump can't seem to decide between ""blame Joe Biden for the bad economy"" and ""credit me for the good economy,"" so he's pushing both lines simultaneously.

For those rooting for the U.S. economy, there's been plenty of good news worth celebrating lately. The combination of historically low unemployment, economic growth, shrinking inflation, rising wages, and a rising stock market have given Americans renewed optimism about the health of the resilient economy.

Just as notably, the economy in the United States isn't just strong from a historical perspective, it's also strong by an international perspective. The Washington Post reported over the weekend on an underappreciated detail: Our economy is outpacing our peer nations abroad, which means Americans are experiencing ""the world's best recovery.""

The Post quoted Claudia Sahm, a former Federal Reserve economist, who said, ""The U.S. has really come out of this into a place of strength and is moving forward like covid never happened. We earned this; it wasn't just a fluke.""

From a purely political perspective, this creates some serious challenges for Republicans. Part of the problem, of course, is that GOP officials were hoping to capitalize on perceptions of a weak economy in this year's elections, and reality is clearly getting in the way.

Making matters worse, the reason the U.S. economy is outpacing recoveries elsewhere is that the federal government has invested heavily in the economy in recent years -- which is necessarily at odds with Republican orthodoxy that says government spending does not fuel growth.

But for Trump, the challenges are especially acute.

As regular readers might recall, ahead of Election Day 2020, the then-president repeatedly warned the public that if Joe Biden were elected, the U.S. economy would collapse. His rhetoric wasn't based on anything real or substantive; he just hoped to scare voters into re-electing him.

It led the Republican to declare at the final debate of the 2020 cycle, ""They say the stock market will rule if I'm elected. If he's elected, the stock market will crash."" Around the same time, Trump also told supporters that Democratic policies would ""unleash an economic disaster of epic proportions"" and force the country ""into depression.""

Everything he said and predicted was wrong -- which leaves the GOP's presumptive nominee in a bit of a bind.

On the one hand, Trump appears desperate to convince people that the healthy U.S. economy isn't healthy at all. On Dec. 29, he published an item to his social media account assuring the public that the national economy is ""TERRIBLE,"" the truth notwithstanding, adding a prediction that if President Biden is re-elected, we'll suffer a ""'CRASH' WORSE THAN THAT OF 1929 -- A GREAT DEPRESSION!!!""

The former president soon after campaigned in New Hampshire and described a dystopia that bore resemblance to our reality. ""[B]anks are collapsing,"" Trump said, pointing to events that are unfolding only in his imagination. He added, ""We are a nation whose economy is collapsing into a cesspool of ruin, whose supply chain is broken, whose stores are not stocked.""

None of this was even remotely true. It was also soon contradicted by Trump's own attempts to claim credit for good economic news. CNBC reported:

So let's take stock of what the likely Republican presidential nominee wants voters to believe. First, the economy is terrible, and people should definitely blame Biden. Second, parts of the economy are great, and people should definitely credit Trump.

And third, when people see economic data that might make them feel better about the resilient U.S. economy, they should assume that the figures are ""fake,"" unless Trump likes the data, in which case he'll claim credit for the good news.

The former president, impervious to shame, is pushing each of these lines simultaneously, creating an utterly incoherent message.","Trump can't seem to decide between ""blame Joe Biden for the bad economy"" and ""credit me for the good economy"" julian zelizer: Trump is pushing both lines simultaneously, creating an utterly incoherent message. he says Trump is trying to convince people that the U.

2024-01-30,Opinion | The eve of a Trump-Biden rematch is the worst time to subvert impeachment,"By Norman Eisen, former impeachment counsel to the House Judiciary Committee, Fred Wertheimer, founder and president of Democracy 21 and Sasha Matsuki, research assistant at State Democracy Defenders Action

House Republicans have spent months searching unsuccessfully for a smoking gun in the Joe Biden impeachment investigation. Instead of admitting failure, they are now pivoting to another target in their frenzy to impeach anyone, no matter how baselessly: Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.

Both the Biden and Mayorkas impeachments are clearly not backed up by evidence. And both borrow from a House Freedom Caucus playbook of unmerited impeachment proceedings that dates to the failed 2016 impeachment of then-IRS Commissioner John Koskinen. What really concerns us, though, is the way these impeachments will both weaponize a key constitutional remedy and undermine its sober original intent. America needs impeachment to deal with the threat of future rogue presidents or other wayward government officials. Ahead of a potential Trump-Biden rematch, this is the worst possible time to turn the threat of impeachment into a partisan joke.

It is bad enough that House Republicans appear to be torpedoing a proposed compromise on border security legislation. But they are now going further to placate the leader of their party. Donald Trump was impeached, and so they are bound and determined to impeach someone, anyone, in retaliation -- no matter the lack of any constitutional basis.

Biden was their initial target. On his first full day in office in 2021, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., introduced articles of impeachment based on nothing. And Republicans have been unsuccessfully trying to find any shred of ""evidence"" ever since. The GOP has contemplated impeaching the president over the White House's border policy (foreshadowing its focus on Mayorkas) and Biden's family business dealings.

Last September, then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., announced that he was directing the House to formally look into allegedly improper business dealings by Biden. But while investigators have amassed dozens of hours of testimony and tens of thousands of pages of subpoenaed bank records, they have yet to uncover any evidence of wrongdoing, much less something rising to the level of ""high crimes and misdemeanors.""

Meanwhile, the clock is ticking, and so the focus has shifted (for the time being). The problem is there is also no evidence against Mayorkas of the ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" required by the Constitution for impeachment. The Constitution's impeachment standard was not meant to apply to policy differences such as those over immigration and border enforcement. The framers never intended for impeachment to be used as a cudgel to be wielded against political enemies. Mayorkas' conduct does not provide any basis for impeachment.

Sure, Republicans accused Democrats of using impeachment for political purposes when it came to Trump. But both of his impeachments were supported by an overwhelming cache of evidence -- some of it broadcast live on television during the Jan. 6, 2021, mob attack on the Capitol.

To truly see the origins of the House Freedom Caucus' mania for abusive impeachment, we must look to 2016, when Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and his allies in the House attempted to impeach Koskinen without cause. Jordan himself presented the impeachment resolution on the House floor for a requested vote.

In the resolution, Koskinen was accused of lying to Congress about how and why the IRS delayed the tax-exempt application process of a plethora of organizations, hundreds of which were conservative. Koskinen was not the head of the IRS at the time of these alleged delays, however, and the Justice Department uncovered ""poor judgment"" but no criminal wrongdoing. It was just Jordan's and the Freedom Caucus' attempt to look tough on the IRS in front of their tea party supporters.

Fortunately, it was a saner time, and plenty of Democrats and Republicans recognized the move for what it was -- a brazen attempt to lash out politically, rather than an earnest response to wrongdoing. The House voted an overwhelming 342-72 to send the impeachment resolution back to the Judiciary Committee, avoiding a floor vote and, essentially, killing the effort.

But Jordan's failed impeachment of Koskinen gave him and his House Freedom Caucus colleagues a taste for pursuing baseless impeachments for political purposes. Now they are returning to the same playbook, trying to make an example of Mayorkas to show just how tough on illegal immigration they can be. As with their anti-IRS pandering, Jordan and his peers cannot resist using impeachment to exploit the hot-button issues of migration and the border.

But America is in a different place today than it was even eight years ago. As Republicans continue to use impeachment as a political weapon, they undermine its constitutional importance and its essential role as a means of checks and balances. By continuing to cry wolf when none is at the door, they lower our guard for when impeachment may actually be needed in the future. Trump's conduct was so egregious during his first administration that he was impeached two separate times. Who knows what could happen if he returns to the Oval Office in 2025, angry and hellbent on vengeance?","House Republicans have spent months searching unsuccessfully for a smoking gun in Joe Biden's impeachment investigation.

2024-01-30,GOP unveils Mayorkas impeachment articles despite lack of evidence,"Republicans don't have evidence of DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas committing high crimes. They unveiled articles of impeachment against him anyway.

Among those who watch Congress closely, there were many who found it difficult to believe that House Republicans would move forward with plans to impeach a sitting cabinet secretary without evidence of high crimes. The GOP conference is quite radical, but it wouldn't go this far, would it?

The answer continues to come into sharper focus. NBC News reported:

The unveiling of the impeachment articles came on the heels of a ""Dear Colleagues"" letter from House Speaker Mike Johnson, which not only endorsed the impeachment effort, but also added that ""a vote on the floor will be held as soon as possible"" after the Homeland Security Committee advances the articles. That committee vote is expected Tuesday -- as in tomorrow -- and by all appearances, it's likely to fall along party lines.

The Louisiana Republican's letter also included an appeal in the third paragraph for Democrats to embrace the House GOP's right-wing immigration bill -- H.R. 2, the so-called ""Secure the Border Act"" -- while adding in the seventh paragraph that President Joe Biden can act unilaterally and doesn't need Congress to do anything. In the same paragraph, Johnson went on to suggest the Democratic president won't enforce immigration laws anyway.

It was all a bit confusing.

Nevertheless, the Homeland Security Committee is poised to act, following the panel's recent impeachment hearings against Mayorkas -- a process that produced no evidence that the DHS secretary committed high crimes.

Circling back to our coverage from last week, a variety of constitutional experts from the left, right, and center have slammed the effort, arguing that impeaching a cabinet secretary without evidence of constitutional crimes would be at odds with our system of government and potentially dangerous. Even Jonathan Turley -- ordinarily, a reliable ally for congressional Republicans -- told GOP lawmakers they would be ""wise to avoid"" such a radical course.

At least for now, the party is ignoring the advice. Republicans have effectively concluded that Mayorkas is doing his job poorly -- a dubious assertion, to be sure -- which they believe is enough to warrant impeachment.

As the process moves forward, I continue to believe there are four elements to keep in mind. The first is the historical oddity of such an effort: The only time in American history that a cabinet secretary was impeached was in 1876, when the House impeached Secretary of War William Belknap -- after he left office -- over alleged bribes. (He was later acquitted by senators.)

The second is that even if Mayorkas were to be impeached, there's little to suggest the Senate would convict him and remove him from office. Politico reported that some GOP senators ""are openly signaling that even if impeachment managed to squeak through the House, it would quickly die in their chamber -- and not just at the hands of the Democratic majority.""

Third, there's no reason to assume that House Republicans would stop with the Homeland Security secretary. On the contrary, impeaching Mayorkas would likely embolden GOP radicals, who would target others, too. Given that the party's impeachment list is almost comically long,

Finally, there are standards to consider: What would happen to the future of American politics if members of Congress decide they no longer need evidence of high crimes to impeach an official they don't like?","House Republicans unveiled articles of impeachment against DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas anyway. john avlon: the GOP conference is quite radical, but it wouldn't go this far, would it? he says a vote on the floor is expected Tuesday -- as in tomorrow -- and by all appearances, it's likely to fall along party lines. the only time in American history a cabinet secretary was impeached was in 1876.","[('dhs', 0.4548), ('impeachment', 0.4401), ('impeached', 0.4262), ('mayorkas', 0.3263), ('republicans', 0.3184), ('gop', 0.2799), ('secretary', 0.2472), ('tomorrow', 0.2322), ('house', 0.2208), ('cabinet', 0.2118)]","dhs, impeachment, impeached, mayorkas, republicans, gop, secretary, tomorrow, house, cabinet",42
2024-01-30,Opinion | This Idaho plan to get rid of domestic terrorism doesn't involve fighting it,"I've got great news. Despite its notorious history of racist and anti-government violence carried out by militia groups, we may no longer need to worry about domestic terrorism in Idaho. The Idaho Senate voted Thursday 27-8 to advance a bill that defines ""domestic terrorism"" as requiring the involvement of foreign groups. According to the bill, if there's no foreign involvement, then there can be no domestic terrorism.

If you think that sounds like it's opposite the meaning of ""domestic,"" you're right. The problem is not only that this contortionist's view of our domestic threat defies logic, but also that it seems aimed at clouding any perception of fellow Americans as a threat.

Idaho Senate Bill 1220's statement of purpose explains that it would codify this bizarre definition of domestic terrorism while simultaneously ensuring that no one in Idaho could be called a domestic terrorist, or a terrorist of any kind, unless they've been convicted of or pleaded guilty to activities connected to a foreign terrorist group.

Idaho Senate Majority Leader Kelly Anthon, the Republican who sponsored the bill, wraps himself in a ""free speech"" defense when he explains his proposal to essentially erase the notion of domestic terrorism as we know it. To hear him tell it, terrorists are simply people who speak their minds and hang out with their peers.

""You have the right to say things that people don't like,"" Anthon said. People ""have a right to assemble and protest the government for their grievances, even when you don't like the group. There's a lot of these groups I don't like, but they have a constitutional right to do it.""

Of course, Anthon's idea of free speech has its limits. You apparently don't have the right to call someone a domestic terrorist. ""If you are called a domestic terrorist it is going to affect your name, it's going to affect your business, it's going to affect your family,"" he said. ""And it's not fair if you've never had your due process and you've never had your day in court.""

Anthon says his inspiration to erase the idea that there's domestic terrorism came from Moms for Liberty, an activist outfit that bills itself as a ""parental rights group"" that he claims was targeted by the government when its members protested at school board meetings during Covid-19 school shutdowns.

Anthon noted the dust-up in 2021 when the National School Boards Association asked President Joe Biden to look into threats and intimidation against school boards. The school boards group claimed such threats might be domestic terrorism, but Attorney General Merrick Garland said, in writing, that federal law enforcement would investigate only criminal behavior. Apparently, Anthon missed that memo.

Is he also forgetting his state's history? In 1986, in Coeur d'Alene, the domestic terrorist neo-Nazi group Aryan Nations, based in Idaho, bombed the residence of the Rev. Bill Wassmuth, a Catholic priest who led protests against white supremacists.

An Aryan Nations splinter group in Idaho later murdered a Jewish radio host in Denver and bombed a synagogue. In 1992, at Ruby Ridge in Boundary County, Idaho, Randy Weaver -- believed to be associated with the Aryan Nations and indirectly linked to a terror group called The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord, and his friend engaged in a deadly shootout with U.S. marshals and the FBI.

Months after the Coeur d'Alene bombing, in 1987, Idaho passed the Idaho Terrorist Control Act. Anthon's bill would amend -- essentially, neuter -- that law. Groups like those named above wouldn't face the same state penalties for criminal acts they commit if the bill were to become law. They might be charged with and convicted of crimes, but, absent proven foreign connections, they'd no longer be subject to the 10-year minimum penalty Idaho currently reserves for domestic terrorists.

If this bill were to succeed and more states were to follow Idaho's legislative lunacy, the reality of the threat and risk posed by domestic terrorism wouldn't vanish. But the threat some Americans pose to other Americans would become yet another thing we couldn't agree on. It would become a problem that law enforcement and the courts would be constrained from fully addressing.

Taken to its illogical extreme, other crimes could be counted as free speech. How about bank robbery as a free speech expression against the tyranny of global bankers and the grip of usurious interest rates on the common man? Should we ban police from describing an arrestee as a ""bank robbery suspect"" until they plead guilty or are convicted? If we don't, the suspect's feelings and reputation might be damaged. If we use the bill in Idaho as our guide, we'd have to instruct the police to call a fleeing suspect a free speech activist who merely lost his way.

Senators in Idaho, at least the 27 who advanced this bill, have lost their way. They apparently don't like it when folks who look like them and live near them get called domestic terrorists. So instead of dealing with the threat, they'd rather outlaw a label. Let's hope the full Legislature puts them back on the path to sanity.","Idaho Senate votes to define ""domestic terrorism"" as requiring involvement of foreign groups. bill would codify bizarre definition of domestic terrorism while ensuring no one could be called a domestic terrorist.

2024-01-30,Opinion | What we keep getting wrong about deepfakes like the fake Taylor Swift nudes,"By Sophie Maddocks, research fellow at the Center for Media at Risk at the University of Pennsylvania.

The hashtag #ProtectTaylorSwift started trending on X on Thursday after AI-generated nude images of the star flooded the internet. First uploaded to Telegram, the images were quickly reposted across social media, viewed millions of times, and on some platforms have yet to be deleted. In response, X appeared to disable searches for Swift's name days after the images surfaced, but after cutting one-third of its content moderators over the last two years, this effort is too little, too late. It is easy for users to get around and it is unclear if it would be replicated for non-celebrities. While it is an important option for victims, making people unsearchable for indeterminate periods of time without their consent could contribute to the broader silencing effect that online harassment has on victims

The reality that anyone can be ""virtually stripped"" in seconds is a frightening prospect -- but there is a lot we can do to prevent it. We can start by addressing the truth that lies beneath the technology: We don't care enough about people's -- primarily women's -- consent.

There's a name for creating and distributing fake sexual images of people without their consent: ""image-based sexual abuse."" It predominantly targets women and girls, and according to independent researcher Genevieve Oh, it's exponentially increasing. Last year, the number of fake nudes circulating online increased tenfold and became even more realistic thanks to new artificial intelligence models trained on images of women scraped from the internet without their consent. When the fake sexually explicit images of Swift began circulating online, it was no surprise to activists who have been sounding the alarm about so-called ""deep fake porn"" since it went viral on Reddit in 2017.

The first wave of deep fake porn mostly targeted high-profile women, but today Swift's teenage fans are as likely as she is to be deep faked. Schools across the United States are grappling with the rise of AI nudes created by children, who are also themselves at risk of grooming and sextortion from adults via AI-generated images.

As well as causing serious harm, AI-generated nudes are tricky to regulate. Although a bill has been introduced and 16 states offer some legal protections, there is not yet a federal law banning AI-generated nudes. This leaves victims reliant on a patchwork of civil and criminal recourse through ""revenge porn,"" defamation, copyright or child pornography laws. With the worst offenders masking their IP addresses or hiding in the dark web, internationally joined-up laws are needed to curb the rise of sextortion scams, grooming and AI-generated imagery of child sexual abuse.

Our solutions to deepfakes often focus on distinguishing ""real"" from ""fake,"" but for most victims, that doesn't help; either way, many victims report feeling like they have been sexually assaulted. Depression, sexual trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder are common experiences for both children and adult victims, who struggle to feel psychologically safe because their images can never be fully deleted. Some victims have lost their jobs, moved to the other side of the country and even changed their names, all while searching websites every day to see if the content has been reposted. The real harm here is the creation of sexual imagery without consent. Therefore our solutions must go beyond distinguishing real from fake, and distinguish consent from nonconsent.

According to historian Jessica Lake, fake nudes date back to the early days of photography. Fast-forward 150 years and the technology has certainly changed, but people's motivations haven't. They create fake nudes to make money via scams like sextortion, to punish, control or manipulate others, to indulge in sexual fantasies, to bond with others, to fit in or simply because they think it's funny and entertaining. What connects most of these motives is the view that people's bodies can be used without their consent.

It's impossible to scrub all nonconsensually created sexual content from the internet, but we can halt its spread by holding accountable the big tech companies that host, own or direct traffic toward the tools that are flooding the internet with deepfake porn. At the very least, Google and other search engines should proactively delist the video generators being used to create this content. Websites that host any sexual imagery should also run meaningful age and consent verification. As well as removing images and cracking down on forums where offenders gather, social media platforms should use preventative prompts to shape user behavior and proactively moderate repeat offenders.

My research indicates that young people are passionate about protecting one another's privacy, and we saw this play out when Swift's fans jumped to her defense on X. We need to follow their lead by centering privacy, consent and equity in the regulation of AI nudes for the victims who don't have an army of fans rushing to their defense. Image-based sexual abuse disproportionately targets minoritized women and femmes, a pattern that is likely to persist with AI nudes. These are the lived-experience experts, and solutions must center their bodily autonomy.

Ultimately, if we focus on centering consent, we can improve AI tools in ways that protect both privacy and sexual expression.","#ProtectTaylorSwift trended on X after AI-generated nude images of Swift surfaced.

2024-01-29,Alabama's attorney general shares a grim prediction about executions with nitrogen gas,"Despite condemnation from U.N. and E.U. officials, Alabama's AG said he thinks his state will ""definitely"" execute more inmates via nitrogen asphyxiation -- and encouraged other states to do the same.

Shortly after Alabama carried out its historic and widely criticized decision to execute a prisoner using nitrogen gas, the state's attorney general told residents to expect more such executions and encouraged other states to use the previously untested method.

Alabama executed Kenneth Smith, who was convicted of murder, on Thursday -- and it was the second time the state had tried to execute him, after a failed attempt via lethal injection. The move came over the objection of multiple Supreme Court justices, the United Nations' human rights chief and other groups.

At a news conference on Friday that sounded at times like a capital punishment pep rally, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall praised the prosecutors on Smith's case, saying: ""As the numbers prove, they're the best team of capital litigators in the country, bar none, and I could not be prouder of the work they've done.""

According to the Death Penalty Information Center, only Florida, Georgia, Missouri and Texas have executed more prisoners over the past decade than Alabama -- and Marshall said more such executions are in store. The attorney general also said 43 other death row inmates in Alabama have chosen to die by nitrogen gas.

""I think we will definitely have more nitrogen hypoxia executions in Alabama,"" he said.

And Marshall offered a message of encouragement to his counterparts in other states: ""Alabama has done it, and now so can you. We stand ready to assist you in implementing this method in your states.""

That same day, officials from the European Union and the United Nations rebuked Alabama over Smith's execution. But all things considered, it doesn't seem like the backlash is going to stop Alabama -- or, potentially, other states -- from moving forward with executions using nitrogen asphyxiation. And that's a problem at home and abroad.

The E.U. and U.N. statements leave no question: America's moral authority is diminished when we engage in behavior widely seen as cruel and unusual. And hemorrhaging moral authority makes it difficult to demand that other countries treat their citizens justly.","Alabama executed Kenneth Smith, who was convicted of murder, on Thursday.

2024-01-29,"Opinion | No one deserves a library appointment less than this ""Libs of Tik Tok"" founder","By Rep. Mickey Dollens, Minority Whip for the Oklahoma House of Representatives

Oklahoma State Superintendent Ryan Walters' decision to appoint ""Libs of TikTok"" creator Chaya Raichik to the Oklahoma State Department of Education Library Media Advisory Committee is a particularly egregious example of elected officials trying to divert the public's attention away from real issues to stoke division and gain national notoriety. The appointment is a calculated move that epitomizes conservative officials choosing sensationalism over the needs of their constituents.

Raichik is legendary in far-right social media circles for spreading misinformation and hate speech, much of which has targeted LGBTQ people. Walters shared some of her ""Libs of Tik Tok"" posts last year and, after he did, there were dozens of bomb threats throughout Tulsa Public Schools and death threats against a teacher. (Those threats were deemed noncredible.) Raichik's posts have often preceded threats against public school teachers and health care professionals across the nation. Raichik has said she has ""denounced violence"" and says there's no proof that the threats came from her followers.

Raichik did not respond to a set of questions sent by NBC News last week. The ""Libs of TikTok"" account replied to a request for comment on X with a compilation of drawings seemingly from young adult novels that depict sexual encounters and asked: ""Do you think this is appropriate for kids in school?"" After that NBC News report, she reiterated that ""extra-legal violence and threats of violence have no place in our society.""

In a statement, Walters said of the appointment, ""Chaya Raichik and I have developed a strong working relationship to rid schools of liberal, woke values.""

Raichik is not only unqualified to serve on this committee but she should be disqualified. According to the State Department of Education's rules for membership in advisory councils, ""Membership of such councils shall be representative of the people to be served.""

Is Raichik a librarian? No. Does she have a background in education? No. Does she have a child who attends an Oklahoma school? Again, no. She doesn't even live here. She's been a real estate agent in Brooklyn.

Walters and Raichik have repeatedly claimed that school libraries in Oklahoma are riddled with porn. Days after Walters her appointment, Raichik appeared at the state department of education's monthly board meeting via recorded video response, delivering a message stating her goal is to ""Fix our schools, take back our schools, remove porn from schools; you can't stop us, and we're going to be effective; we're going to get this done.""

Last August, a local news station, KFOR, filed an open records request with the State Department of Education, asking which school sites had pornographic material, which books were deemed inappropriate and how many of those books were found. KFOR told me that, to this day, no proof has been provided.

Walters' appointment of Raichik is a distraction tactic. His department erroneously issued substantial bonuses to at least nine teachers, some as high as $50,000, and is now demanding the repayment of these bonuses. The error of giving bonuses to teachers who apparently did not meet the qualifications for them has caused considerable disappointment among those teachers, not to mention financial distress for those who had already spent part of the bonus.

According to the Oklahoma Watch, Kristina Stadelman's family, which just welcomed a new baby, ""was able to make some home improvements, place a down payment on a bigger car for their now-seven-member family and support the household while she takes time off with the baby."" Walters' department wants the money back by the end of next month.

The distribution of those bonuses and Walters' decision to ""claw back"" the money, as reported by The Oklahoman, raise questions about his leadership and judgment. Walters told reporters last week that the bonus program ""is the most successful"" program in Oklahoma's history. According to The Oklahoman's reporting, Walters said, ""... if any individual lied throughout the process, did not agree to follow the stipulations ... we will claw back those dollars.""

Clearly, there's been a loss of confidence in his fitness to run the department. That was the big story in Oklahoma last week. Then Walters announced the Raichik appointment.

Oklahoma House Democrats have asked Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond to look into the teacher bonus clawbacks and the State Department of Education's rule for membership on advisory councils. Oklahoma Speaker of the House Charles McCall denied Democrats' request to form a bipartisan committee to investigate allegations that would be grounds for impeachment.

What's happening in the Sooner State reflects a broader pattern in which officials, instead of tackling real problems, manufacture controversies for political gain.

Take state Rep. J.J. Humphrey, who, responding to nonsense stories about students identifying as cats, has proposed a statewide ""furry"" ban requiring a student who dresses up like an animal at school be picked up by a parent or, get this, be removed by animal control.

These manufactured controversies create a public uproar and produce more soundbites and headlines than meaningful dialogue or solutions. They also bring attention and help put these officials on a national political stage, often at the cost of the well-being and progress of the communities they are supposed to serve.

Real issues, including the underfunding of our schools, a lack of adequate mental health services and the need for more comprehensive career guidance, remain unaddressed.

Raichik's appointment is a symptom of a larger problem in American politics of elected officials increasingly deciding to create controversies to gain fame and distract from their failures. This trend is detrimental to the democratic process and the fundamental principle of governance, which is to serve the public good.

As citizens, we have the power and responsibility to ensure that our elected officials prioritize our needs and address pressing problems. We must remain vigilant and demand that our elected representatives focus on real issues rather than engaging in political theater or partisan agendas. If the last few years are any indication of what's to come, if we don't show how much we disapprove, their tactics will only continue to escalate.","Rep.

2024-01-29,West Virginia governor backs anti-trans 'Women's Bill of Rights.' Here's what's in it.,"State Republicans have proposed a bill that mandates anti-trans harassment in the guise of women's rights. They're following a trend.

West Virginia Republican Gov. Jim Justice at a news conference on Monday endorsed what's being billed as a ""Women's Bill of Rights,"" introduced last week in the state House. The move makes him the latest Republican governor to engage in this increasingly popular Trojan Horse-style stunt.

Despite its name, this proposed ""bill of rights"" doesn't guarantee to the women of West Virginia access to abortion care or their bodily autonomy -- which they are being denied due to the state's anti-abortion laws. And it doesn't guarantee institutional opportunities for women outside the home, which would be helpful as the GOP targets a key resource for women in workplaces and schools: diversity, equity and inclusion policies.

No, this ""bill of rights"" is just anti-LGBTQ propaganda designed to demonize trans women. The full name of West Virginia's proposed ""women's bill of rights"" doesn't roll off the tongue quite as well: It's ""The West Virginia Act to Define Sex-Based Terms Used in State Law, Help Protect Single Sex Spaces, and Ensure the Accuracy of Public Data Collection."" And it fits a trend of similar proposals that have been pushed in other Republican-controlled states.

The bill attempts a reductive definition of a woman as a person whose ""reproductive system ... at some point produces ova."" But as The Associated Press noted last year, this strict definition marginalizes ""people born with genitalia, reproductive organs, chromosomes and/or hormone levels that don't fit typical definitions for male or female.""

The West Virginia bill, which mirrors policies enacted in Kansas, Oklahoma and Nebraska, ensures trans women aren't able to use facilities or services designated for women. The law includes ""athletics, living facilities, locker rooms, bathrooms, domestic violence shelters, and rape crisis centers"" and requires government-run agencies, including schools under the state department of education, to abide by this simplistic definition of gender when recording data on members.

Watch video of Justice endorsing the bill below:

One of the people sitting at Justice's side during his endorsement was Riley Gaines, the former college swimmer who's made a right-wing media career out of whining about her fifth-place tie in 2022 with Lia Thomas, a trans woman who competed against her.

Gaines is an ambassador for a group called Independent Women's Voice, an organization that has promoted the anti-trans ""women's bill of rights"" in other states. As the Guardian reported last summer:

These so-called women's bills of rights are actually blunt weapons to attack trans women and are being used as a wedge issue to disguise conservative efforts to roll back women's rights more broadly.","State Republicans have proposed a bill that mandates anti-trans harassment in the guise of women's rights.

2024-01-29,Opinion | Why so-called exceptions to abortion bans are functionally meaningless,"New research estimates that sexual assault caused over 64,000 pregnancies in states where abortion is completely banned.

After I posted a quick TikTok about new research that estimates that sexual assault caused over 64,000 pregnancies in states where abortion is completely banned, a man popped into the comments to downplay the findings. When he couldn't get traction on his complaints, he made a crack about the fact that I color my hair purple. He seemed to have missed that I also color my hair blue and maroon, but I didn't want to quibble with him about it while he was already stewing.

I keep thinking about that anti-abortion dude and connecting him to the research on sexual assault and pregnancy published by JAMA. It's telling that something as banal as hair color can so easily rile these types of guys up, isn't it? But it makes perfect sense that someone bothered by such a radical expression of bodily autonomy -- that is, me dying my hair fun colors -- would believe the government should be able to force people to stay pregnant against their will.

If I wanted people to believe that my investment in denying abortion access to tens of millions of people arose from a passion for preserving life and not, let's say, an unmitigated sense of entitlement and rabid desire for control over other people's bodies, then I'd probably have responded a little differently than this guy. At the very least, I might steer clear of language that serves to minimize the horrible consequences of sexual assault. But it's getting harder for abortion opponents to mask their true aims: to preserve and perpetuate patriarchal power, and to punish and persecute pregnant people who are insufficiently compliant, obedient and subservient.

The researchers behind the JAMA estimates acknowledged that their numbers are simply that -- estimates -- due to the difficulty of obtaining accurate statistics on rape and sexual assault. The numbers are horrifying, but they are still less striking than what they tell us about abortion bans and their impacts: that, as the JAMA research reveals, ""persons who have been raped and become pregnant cannot access legal abortions in their home state, even in states with rape exceptions.""

This is by design. Tens of thousands of people forced into pregnancy and compelled to carry pregnancies to term are not the unintended collateral damage of abortion bans. They're among the the intended targets of abortion bans, because anti-abortion politics are the politics of abuse. Rapists and sexual predators and domestic and intimate partner abusers are motivated by the desire for control and domination. So, too, backers of abortion bans. The laws are working as intended -- including by creating false dichotomies around ""good"" abortions and ""bad"" ones.

Reproductive justice advocates have been arguing against the idea of justified and unjustified abortions for years because conversations -- especially political ones -- around rape exceptions to abortion bans can easily lead to a conclusion that some people's abortions might be more legitimate than others. So let's be clear: These conversations are smoke screens, distractions from the simple fact that abortion is a basic human right, and no one should be forced into pregnancy or parenting.

Indeed, the research in JAMA highlights the folly of the ""good"" and ""bad"" abortion binary. So-called exceptions to abortion bans are functionally meaningless. Rape and incest exceptions to abortion bans are rarely invoked because claiming the exception would likely involve retraumatizing survivors, many of whom have good reason not to want to be forced to involve law enforcement, as so many ""exceptions"" laws require.

However, it's not just rape-related exceptions that are rarely used in real-life circumstances. The same is also true for those supposed exceptions for fetal anomalies and threats to the health of the pregnant person. Indeed, the Kaiser Family Foundation has called life- and health-related abortion ban exceptions ""unworkable."" We saw the real-world implications of those supposed exceptions in the case of Kate Cox, the Texas woman who was caught in a terrible, and deliberately engineered, Catch-22 when she sought treatment for health-threatening pregnancy complications.

This is the way of anti-abortion abuser politics. We're likely to see even more escalations as abortion rights grow more popular and we secure even more wins at the state and local levels. There'd be no need to tie ourselves in knots carving out exceptions to abortion bans if we embrace the simple fact that abortion ought to be accessible any time to anyone who needs care -- without caveats, obstacles and justifications -- because it's simply the moral, ethical and compassionate approach, whatever the circumstances of a person's pregnancy. Standing firm in this truth is more important than ever as we head into the reproductive rights' battles of 2024 -- whether that's at the ballot box or in a comments section.","new research estimates sexual assault caused over 64,000 pregnancies in states where abortion is banned. lz granderson: it's telling that something as banal as hair color can so easily rile these types of guys up. it makes perfect sense that someone bothered by such a radical expression of bodily autonomy, he says. we're likely to see even more escalations as abortion rights grow more popular.","[('abortion', 0.4683), ('pregnancies', 0.2742), ('caused', 0.2214), ('assault', 0.1974), ('hair', 0.1833), ('color', 0.176), ('banned', 0.1638), ('sexual', 0.1413), ('states', 0.137), ('radical', 0.1132)]","abortion, pregnancies, caused, assault, hair, color, banned, sexual, states, radical",-1
2024-01-29,Opinion | The Biden administration is wrong to suspend aid to UNRWA,"Cutting off funds to the life-saving agency is to subject Palestinians to yet another round of collective punishment.

The United Nations fired nine employees from its Palestinian refugee agency, the United Nations Relief Works Agency, on Friday after Israel accused them of involvement in Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on Israel. The U.N. described the allegations as ""extremely serious and horrific"" and says it's investigating the terminated staffers and will refer them for criminal prosecution if they're found to have been involved.

The State Department's position is that these allegations remain just that, allegations, and that an investigation is needed to sort out what happened. But the U.S. has reacted to the allegations by immediately suspending its funding to the UNRWA. At least 10 other countries have followed suit.

The Biden administration' suspension is a drastic and morally indefensible step. The U.S. is one of the chief donors to the UNRWA, and the agency helps keeps hundreds of thousands of Palestinians alive by coordinating the distribution of humanitarian aid to the economically starved enclave. To cut off the entire agency, especially in concert with several other major donors, is effectively an act of collective punishment -- carried out against a people who have been subjected to lethal collective punishment for months. And it could have swiftly devastating consequences: the U.N. says it won't be able to continue humanitarian operations beyond the end of February unless funding resumes.

Israel hasn't accused the UNRWA of operating as a secret Hamas cell. Rather, Israeli intelligence agencies say they have evidence that at least 12 UNRWA employees participated in the Oct. 7 attacks and shared that information with the UNRWA and the U.S. U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said in a statement on Sunday that it immediately fired nine of those employees, one is confirmed dead, and that it is clarifying the identities of two of them. NBC News has obtained an Israeli security dossier that names the 12 staffers and additionally claims that around 190 UNWRA staff are members of Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The dossier does not provide evidence for the allegations and NBC News has not been able to independently verify its claims.

The U.S. and the UNRWA have a relationship that goes back decades, and the agency has over 13,000 workers in the Gaza Strip who work across more than 300 installations. It is one of the largest employers in the enclave, and most of its employees are Palestinians. Even if more allegations were to emerge and it's confirmed that the number of people with some connection to the Oct. 7 attacks is somewhat higher, that would still be a tiny fraction of its workforce in the Gaza Strip. That the UNRWA fired the named workers before investigating them signals that it is seriously concerned about the issue -- and concerned about losing support for its humanitarian operation.

The stakes of an interruption in funding for the UNRWA are incredibly high. The agency provides health, educational and refugee camp infrastructure and social services to Palestinian refugees across the region. And since Israel's response to Oct. 7 attacks, it has been pivotal in distributing food and medical aid in Gaza during Israel's siege. This is a matter of life and death for hundreds of thousands of people, given that the siege has reduced the flow of food, water, electricity and other vital goods and services into the territory to the point that U.N. human rights experts say Gazans now make up about 80% of people facing famine or catastrophic hunger worldwide.

UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini expressed shock on the social media platform X on Saturday. ""UNRWA lifesaving assistance is about to end following countries decisions to cut their funding to the Agency,"" he wrote. ""Our humanitarian operation, on which 2 million people depend as a lifeline in Gaza, is collapsing. I am shocked such decisions are taken based on alleged behavior of a few individuals and as the war continues, needs are deepening & famine looms. Palestinians in Gaza did not need this additional collective punishment. This stains all of us.""

The U.S. has hobbled the UNRWA in the past by severing aid. The Trump administration's decision to cut off aid to UNRWA during Donald Trump's tenure, after calling it an ""irredeemably flawed operation,"" had long-term effects on the agency's ability to distribute vital medical aid.

If the implicated UNRWA workers are found guilty of participating in attacks against civilians, then they must be held to account. But punishing the entire agency for a small number of people's actions is neither logical nor conscionable. Just as we would not say that a hospital that employs a doctor who commits a crime should be defunded, similarly it defies common sense and moral duty to divest from a colossal life-saving humanitarian operation in response to allegations against a relatively small set of fringe employees.

The U.S. position also underscores the extraordinary double standard the U.S. has for Israelis versus Palestinians. Israel's government -- that is, not a small set of employees at an aid organization -- is carrying out an ongoing regime of collective punishment in Gaza in violation of international law through its de facto targeting of civilians through indiscriminate bombardment and its creation of a humanitarian crisis. Yet the Biden administration not only continues to ply Israel with aid, but it also uses special expedited processes to send the country heavy weaponry.

If the standard for cutting off aid were a possible connection to war crimes, then the U.S. would have cut Israel off a long time ago. But that's clearly not the case. The Biden administration is guided in this conflict not by consistent principle, but by strategic interest. And millions of Palestinians are paying the price.",the U.

2024-01-29,Opponents of affirmative action set their sights on West Point after Harvard ruling,"The Supreme Court's 6-3 decision gutting affirmative action in higher education left out military academies. That could change soon.

When the Supreme Court gutted affirmative action in higher education last year, the ruling didn't cover military academies. A footnote in Chief Justice John Roberts' opinion for the six Republican appointees said that such schools weren't involved in the appeal and that the ruling ""does not address the issue, in light of the potentially distinct interests that military academies may present.""

Now the same group that brought last year's case to the high court is back, pressing one against West Point. Students for Fair Admissions filed an emergency application for an injunction pending appeal. A response to the application is due Tuesday by 5 p.m. ET.

Dissenting justices in last year's decision, involving Harvard and the University of North Carolina, called out the majority's military carve-out. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that it ""only highlights the arbitrariness of its [the majority's] decision and further proves that the Fourteenth Amendment does not categorically prohibit the use of race in college admissions."" Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote that the court ""has come to rest on the bottom-line conclusion that racial diversity in higher education is only worth potentially preserving insofar as it might be needed to prepare Black Americans and other underrepresented minorities for success in the bunker, not the boardroom (a particularly awkward place to land, in light of the history the majority opts to ignore).""

With the prospect of a natural follow-on to last year's decision, the court could be forced to confront that awkward distinction.","Supreme Court's 6-3 decision gutting affirmative action in higher education left out military academies. the same group that brought last year's case to the high court is back, pressing one against West Point.

2024-01-29,"Marjorie Taylor Greene talks up 'national divorce' (yes, again)","Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene occasionally references the importance of patriotism, which make it all the more notable that the Georgia Republican seems awfully interested in breaking the United States apart. Business Insider noted:

""When I said we need a National Divorce this is exactly what I'm talking about and a serious example as to why,"" the right-wing congresswoman wrote.

If this seems at all familiar, it's not your imagination.

In late 2021, Greene briefly referenced ""a National Divorce scenario"" that seemed to allude to the dissolution of the United States. About a year later, the Georgia Republican seemed to predict a ""national divorce"" in response to the CDC adding Covid shots to its list of recommended vaccine schedules.

Nearly a year ago, as a variety elected officials released statements recognizing the Presidents' Day holiday, the Greene published a message to social media that read, ""We need a national divorce. We need to separate by red states and blue states. ... Everyone I talk to says this. From the sick and disgusting woke culture issues shoved down our throats to the Democrat's [sic] traitorous America Last policies, we are done.""

A day later, in case she'd been too subtle, she wrote a follow-up tweet a day later, adding, ""Impeach Biden or give us a national divorce.""

A month later, while continuing to talk up her idea, Greene raised the prospect of individual counties succeeding from their respective states.

That was 2023. In 2024, succession remains very much of the right-wing congresswoman's mind.

Circling back to our earlier coverage, none of this is likely to surprise anyone. Greene has expressed support for violence against Democratic elected officials, and in the recent past, the Georgia Republican appeared at a white-nationalist event. The fact that she's endorsed a vision in which Americans ""separate by red states and blue states"" is entirely in line with everything we know about her.

But let's not lose sight of the larger context: GOP leaders have rewarded Greene with, among other things, a slot on the House Homeland Security Committee. Are Republicans prepared to defend a member of the House Homeland Security Committee openly endorsing the dissolution of the United States?

That's not a rhetorical question. House Speaker Mike Johnson and his team should let the public know whether they're comfortable with such a dynamic -- and what they're prepared to do in response if they're not comfortable with such a dynamic.

Indeed, that's ultimately what matters most in response to so many of the controversies Greene creates. Her extremism is routine to the point that's become background noise. Basic American patriotism generally prevents elected officials from endorsing the dissolution of the United States, but we've reached the point in our collective history at which members of Congress can publish such messages -- which would've sparked a genuine scandal up until fairly recently -- and much of the political world shrugs, seeing it as somehow routine.

With this in mind, it seems as if the focus should be on conference leaders. Greene's extremism has become predictable, but their responses to her radical vision are still relevant. How comfortable are GOP leaders with one of their prominent members calling for the breaking up of our country? What are they prepared to do about it?

Can Americans feel confident in the work of the House Homeland Security Committee knowing that Greene is on it -- and she no longer wants to live in the same country as millions of Americans?","Rep.

2024-01-29,Can AI actually help parents? These moms say absolutely.,"But one group was -- as usual -- nearly left out of the conversation: parents.

As moms in the tech space -- Reshma as the founder of Girls Who Code and Moms First, and Emily as the founder and CEO of ParentData -- we know that this technology has the power to transform not only our jobs and our government, but our home lives, too.

Already, parents are finding creative uses for the new AI tools that have appeared in the last few years: from making schedules and meal plans with ChatGPT, to revamping bedtime stories using MidJourney.

Clearly parents have an appetite for AI, but this technology can do more than just offer quick fixes to help parents make it through the day. It can help answer the tough questions that keep parents up at night.

Take one of the biggest questions facing parents: Where should I send my child to school? Say that your child is getting ready for pre-K, and you're weighing whether you should move to a different school district. You probably want to find out how the students at each school are doing in reading or math, depending on your child's needs, to help figure out which school is right for them.

So you start Googling. The good news is that every state makes some student test score data publicly available. The bad news? It's nearly impossible to find. The data is messy -- drawing a meaningful conclusion might mean weeding through thousands of Excel rows worth of data points. Even if you have the tools to do this, parents are busy getting everyone from school to soccer to the dinner table, often while trying to work somewhere in between. They don't have hours, let alone days, to comb through every piece of available information.

This is exactly the kind of challenge that AI was designed to tackle. The newest generative AI tools can not only crunch the numbers, but translate them into plain English -- or, better yet, a chart that communicates the important stuff (and only the important stuff) at a glance. They can eliminate the research rabbit hole that parents are all-too familiar with and, in doing so, empower parents to make informed decisions for their families.

AI can even help parents before they become parents. Many moms-to-be are kept up at night by the question: Can I afford to take time off to have my baby? And with good reason: only 13 states and Washington D.C. provide paid leave -- an abysmally low number -- and the average parent loses nearly $10,000 in wages when taking 12 weeks of unpaid leave resulting in too many moms heading back to work mere weeks after giving birth.

You might think the lucky parents with access to paid family leave are using every moment available to them. But they're not. In New York state, for example, only around a quarter of parents who are eligible for parental leave actually take it. Instead, many parents don't realize they have it or if they're even eligible. Or they've tried parsing the available policy jargon and have simply given up.

Again, this is an AI-shaped problem. Instead of spending hours scrolling through government websites, trying to figure out which policies apply to you, what if you could quickly message an AI chatbot -- trained on reliable government resources -- to get the answers you need about your paid leave benefits? All of a sudden, the process is as easy as texting a trusted friend.

We're doing our part, in partnership with the same AI developer, to make this future a reality. Recently, Emily launched an AI tool, Zelma, to help demystify school data for parents.

Reshma launched PaidLeave.ai to give New York parents some clarity about their paid family leave benefits, and she hopes to expand it to more states in the future.

But school selection and family leave are just two of the many, many big questions parents have when raising a child. How can I afford to send my kid to college? How can I find an in-network specialist to treat my daughter's asthma? Are we eligible for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits?

These decisions are hard. But they don't have to be this hard. With AI, we can bring an unprecedented level of transparency to the information parents rely on for their biggest life decisions.

The private sector is already racing to deploy AI technology to make workers more productive. We need more investment, in more tools designed specifically with parents' needs in mind -- particularly parents who will be using AI tools for the very first time.

Crucially, we need to make sure these tools are accessible to the people who actually need them. That means building AI with and for women, people of color, and low-income communities now -- while the technology is still in its relatively early stages.

If we don't prioritize access at the outset, we risk making the mistakes of technologies past. Imagine a world where, in the early years of Web 2.0, we made sure that people around the world were able to utlize the internet. Had we increased global broadband access by just ten percent back in 2014, for example, we could have generated an estimated $186 billion and 875,000 jobs in the U.S. alone.

We're in a critical window, and parents can't afford to miss it. Because while the technology that powers AI can sometimes feel opaque, what it ultimately delivers is clarity. That's something overwhelmed parents urgently need -- especially in our country -- where we often put parents' needs dead last.",Parents are finding creative uses for the new AI tools that have appeared in the last few years.

2024-01-29,GOP extremists whine about Taylor Swift after Chiefs' AFC championship win,"Republican extremists and the online fringe are feeling manipulated because a famous pop singer's romantic interest is on a football team that won a big game.

Taylor Swift's dalliances with politics -- be it her backing of a Democratic Senate candidate in 2018 or using her tour to register voters -- have earned her conservative ire over the last few years.

Just last year, I wrote on the right-wing conspiracy theorists who saw in Swift's selection as Time magazine's Person of the Year a manifestation of psychological warfare waged by liberals to ""indoctrinate"" the public. And Republicans have suggested the same thing about Swift's situation-ship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce: It's part of a Democratic plot!! (Kelce, meanwhile, has been attacked by conservatives and anti-vaxxers for promoting Pfizer's Covid vaccine.)

So it was almost too predictable that after the Chiefs won the AFC championship and punched their ticket to the Super Bowl on Sunday, the right-wing influencer class polished up their tinfoil hats to tell their followers that the win was all part of some liberal psy-op (a military term for psychological operations used during wartime).

As was the case throughout the season, even during Sunday night's game, some right-wingers seemed to suggest that occasional camera shots of Swift had dubious, manipulative intent. The reality is that football games are long and have frequent breaks in the action, so it's understandable why a production crew would want to keep viewers' attention with shots of one of the world's most famous people every once in a while.

But the right's politicized conniption over Swift's mere appearance speaks to the deluded, conspiracy-minded tribalism that's overtaken the modern Republican Party and the MAGA movement's need to paint itself as the victim of a vast, sinister government plot.

From my vantage point, right-wing attacks on Swift for being a liberal plant are more calculated than impulsive, more shrewd than sincere. I see them as attempts by conservatives to A) pressure Swift from taking a political stance that might hurt the GOP ahead of this fall's elections, and B) blunt the impact of any stance she takes in the future that doesn't align with their views.

If and when the moment comes, fully expect Republicans to frame Swift's expression of genuinely held political beliefs as the liberal psy-op they've been predicting all along.","Taylor Swift's dalliances with politics have earned her conservative ire over the last few years. john avlon: right-wing conspiracy theorists see her as manifestation of ""psychological warfare"" he says conservatives are trying to pressure Swift from taking a political stance that might hurt the GOP.","[('conservatives', 0.3547), ('taylor', 0.3469), ('political', 0.3318), ('conservative', 0.3132), ('politics', 0.2931), ('conspiracy', 0.2875), ('swift', 0.2559), ('theorists', 0.179), ('psychological', 0.1742), ('gop', 0.1413)]","conservatives, taylor, political, conservative, politics, conspiracy, swift, theorists, psychological, gop",35
2024-01-29,Key Republicans see friendly fire after striking bipartisan deals,"A couple of key GOP lawmakers struck major bipartisan deals. Their own Republican allies now intend to punish them accordingly.

Roughly four months after the Jan. 6 attack, congressional negotiations began in earnest on how best to investigate the insurrectionist violence at the Capitol. A variety of members envisioned a panel along the lines of the 9/11 Commission, but it fell to a handful of members to work out the details.

GOP leaders dispatched a trusted ally, Republican Rep. John Katko of New York, to negotiate the terms. Then-House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy carefully included unreasonable demands he expected Democrats to reject. That plan didn't work: Katko successfully struck a deal in which Democrats agreed to the GOP's terms.

At that point, Republican leaders rejected the compromise they'd asked for, and Katko was the odd man out. The New Yorker did exactly what was expected of him -- he reached a bipartisan deal his party ostensibly wanted -- before discovering that his party had changed its mind.

Lately, Katko's experiences keep coming to mind.

A couple of weeks ago, for example, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith announced a bipartisan agreement with Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden on tax policy. Following months of talks, the Missouri Republican secured an extension of Trump-era tax breaks for businesses, while the Oregon Democrat secured an expansion of the child tax credit.

It's not yet clear whether the plan will pass -- though we probably won't have to wait too long to find out -- but what is clear is the fact that Smith isn't exactly being celebrated by his allies. Axios reported over the weekend:

Meanwhile, in the upper chamber, a similar dynamic is playing out in ridiculous fashion. USA Today reported:

The same resolution, which was approved on Saturday, went on to call on the conservative Republican senator to ""cease and desist jeopardizing the security and liberty"" of Americans. [Update: See below.]

Just so we're all clear, Lankford appears to have negotiated a bipartisan package on border and immigration policy -- the details of which the Oklahoma Republican Party has not seen -- which the far-right senator believes will be ""by far the most conservative border security bill in four decades."" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina added that they simply won't ""get a better deal"" than the one Democrats were prepared to accept.

For his trouble, Lankford has been formally rebuked by his own state GOP.

What's more, it's not just the Oklahoma Republican Party. Lankford also appeared on Fox News over the weekend, and was asked why he'd give Biden an election-year victory. The senator responded by explaining the bipartisan agreement would be an effective policy -- which he thought was his own party's goal.

Like Katko in 2021, Smith and Lankford thought they were pursuing their own party's priorities. Like Katko in 2021, Smith and Lankford are paying a price for succeeding.

The message to GOP officials couldn't be much clearer: Don't compromise, don't make concessions, and don't try to work across the aisle to solve problems.

Those Republicans who fail to heed such a directive should apparently expect friendly fire.

2024-01-29,Historians support voters against Trump in Colorado ballot case,"The GOP-majority court claims to care about history when interpreting the Constitution. If it does so here, that's a problem for Trump's eligibility.

The Supreme Court claims to care about history when interpreting the Constitution. Of course, the justices have applied that approach selectively. But if they take it seriously in Donald Trump's ballot eligibility case, then a new court filing from historians is a problem for Trump's appeal.

The amicus brief from 25 professional scholars with expertise in 19th-century American history explains that the 14th Amendment's disqualification clause in Section 3 covers the president and doesn't require further congressional action to keep insurrectionists from office. While those aren't the only issues in the case, they're big ones that further support upholding the Colorado Supreme Court's decision disqualifying the former president.

To take one historical example that the brief illuminates, Trump and his supporters have latched on to the fact that the clause doesn't specifically mention presidents. Section 3 says:

To explain why the section nonetheless covers presidents, the historians point to congressional debate at the time of the amendment, in which a senator questioned why presidents were being excluded. The historians recalled that an influential backer of the amendment noted that the section incorporated the president, replying: ""Let me call the Senator's attention to the words 'or hold any office civil or military under the United States.'"" The initial senator ""admitted his error"" and no other senator ""questioned whether Section 3 covered the President,"" the historians wrote.

The implication, then, is that for the Supreme Court to hold that the clause doesn't cover the president would contravene the historical record. This wouldn't be the first time that the court would be doing so, but the brief is a reminder that the court should have to find another avenue if the justices are intent on keeping Trump on the ballot. A convincing avenue for doing so is still unclear ahead of next week's oral arguments, but the Feb. 8 hearing may signal where the court is headed.","the Supreme Court claims to care about history when interpreting the Constitution. if it does so here, that's a problem for Trump's appeal, says a new court filing. the amicus brief explains that the 14th Amendment's disqualification clause covers the president.","[('constitution', 0.353), ('amendment', 0.2811), ('appeal', 0.2636), ('disqualification', 0.2348), ('trump', 0.2147), ('president', 0.205), ('court', 0.164), ('history', 0.1342), ('clause', 0.1238), ('care', 0.1052)]","constitution, amendment, appeal, disqualification, trump, president, court, history, clause, care",31
2024-01-29,"In border debate, White House shows GOP leaders the receipts","After months of intense and detailed talks, Sen. Chris Murphy indicated over the weekend that negotiators have reached an agreement on a package that would address border policy, immigration reforms, and aid to Ukraine. ""We do have a bipartisan deal,"" the Connecticut Democrat told CNN. ""We're finishing the text right now.""

Aside from the key players involved in the process, the details of the agreement are scarce, though as Politico reported, proponents believe a Senate vote could come quite quickly.

Murphy summarized the broader dynamic nicely: ""The question is whether Republicans are going to listen to Donald Trump, who wants to preserve chaos at the border, because he thinks it's a winning political issue for him, or whether we are going to pass legislation which would be the biggest bipartisan reform of our border immigration laws in 40 years and would give the president of the United States, whether that president is a Republican or a Democrat, new, important power to be able to better manage the flow of people across the border.""

President Joe Biden, meanwhile, appears to be upping the ante, issuing a written statement on Friday night saying he's prepared to use new emergency authorities to ""shut down the border when it becomes overwhelmed"" -- but only if Congress approves the pending, bipartisan package.

A day later, the Democrat reiterated the position, apparently in the hopes of giving the burgeoning legislation an added boost.

At least for now, House Republicans have condemned the bipartisan agreement, and House Speaker Mike Johnson declared on Friday that the emerging deal -- if it actually comes together -- would be ""dead on arrival"" in the lower chamber.

As a political matter, Democrats believe this creates an opportunity to turn the tables on the larger debate. After all, the GOP has spent recent years demanding that the president make a deal on border policies, and now Biden is prepared to do exactly that -- embracing an agreement that Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma said would be ""by far the most conservative border security bill in four decades.""

If GOP lawmakers refuse to take ""yes"" for an answer, the argument goes, then it's Republicans who will bear responsibility for the underlying issue.

GOP leaders, meanwhile, have pushed back against such rhetoric, claiming that Biden doesn't need to wait for Congress to act; the White House can simply act unilaterally. It's a flawed argument, in part because every recent administration -- including Barack Obama's and Donald Trump's -- has said it needs statutory changes to the status quo that must come from Capitol Hill.

But just as importantly, GOP leaders themselves have said the same thing.

The White House released a new memo a couple of hours ago, reminding the public of the kind of claims leading House Republicans made in the recent past. As recently as 2019, for example, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said, ""This is a broken system that needs to be fixed. It takes congressional action, you need to change the law.

In early 2023, House Speaker Mike Johnson argued, ""America is the most compassionate nation in the world, but our immigration system is broken. Reforming that system is a job for Congress. Just last month, the Louisiana Republican, in a letter to Biden, added, ""Statutory reforms designed to restore operational control at our southern border must be enacted.""

It is, in other words, a little late for GOP leaders to claim congressional action is irrelevant.

For his part, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer insisted the other day, ""The only reason that President Biden is even interested in discussing this issue is because it has now become a political liability for the White House.""

It's a tough sell -- Biden has been pushing Republicans for an immigration compromise since 2021 -- but even if one is inclined to believe Emmer, it leads to an obvious follow-up question: So what?","House Republicans have condemned the bipartisan agreement.
